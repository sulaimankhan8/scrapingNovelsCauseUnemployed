</p><br><p>After lowering the copper whistle, Klein had already activated his Spirit Vision.
</p><br><p>He saw illusory white bones being weakly thrown up from the ground as they slowly formed a gigantic figure. If the past scenes were like a fountain in a fantasy setting, then this was more like the flow from an ordinary reversed tap.
</p><br><p>The corners of Klein’s mouth moved indiscernibly as he pretended as though he hadn’t noticed anything amiss.
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, the skeleton messenger finally took form. Its nearly four meters body tore through the ceiling once again as the pitch-black flames in its eye sockets burned silently.
</p><br><p>Klein folded the letter he had finished writing and threw it up.
</p><br><p>He described in detail the tycoon, Jimmy Necker, in the letter. He mentioned the connections between the Death chronicles found in the Southern Continent’s Balam Empire’s mausoleum, as well as the connection the item had with Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos and Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy. He also mentioned how he had successfully sneaked in, and although his assassination had failed, he had left behind something that could be used to determine the location of the Black Death.
</p><br><p>Of course, he didn’t go into detail how he sneaked in. He had only roughly recounted Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy’s combat techniques and style.
</p><br><p>After the messenger caught the letter with a swipe that could send an adult human flying, Klein coughed and cleared his throat.
</p><br><p>“I already have a messenger.”
</p><br><p>The pitch-black flames in the skeleton messenger’s sockets clearly flickered before its body collapsed like a waterfall before drilling into the parquet.
</p><br><p><i>You don’t have to be afraid of becoming my messenger anymore, right? Am I that detestable to your kind? Yes... These messengers from the Underworld probably can’t bear to leave Mr. Azik. After all, that’s a direct descendant of Death. There might not even be any skip in the generational line. You want to cozy up with someone powerful. I get it! </i>Klein was just about to pack up and check out when his nose itched suddenly and sneezed.
</p><br><p><i>Achoo! Achoo! Cough! Cough! Cough!</i> </p><br><p>Mucus flowed out as he coughed. His forehead slowly but decisively began burning with heat.
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"></div><br><p><i>Oh no. Vice Admiral Ailment’s ailment is still lingering in my body. And I confronted a 10°C cold wind in order to return to Bayam. I really fell ill as a result... </i>Klein used inferior tissue paper to wipe his mucus, contemplating whether to summon himself and act using a Spirit Body state, so that his physical body could heal by itself.
</p><br><p>After serious consideration, he believed that it was impossible. Firstly, his physical condition would clearly affect his Spirit Body’s condition. The two were closely related in some magical manner. Secondly, if he ignored it, his physical condition would definitely worsen.
</p><br><p><i>I’m becoming a little dazed from the fever... </i>Klein touched his forehead and prepared to return to the Wind of Azure Inn to meet up with Danitz. Then, he had to consider if he should head to a hospital or clinic to buy some medicine.
</p><br><p>...
</p><br><p>In the Berg household in the City of Silver.
</p><br><p>Derrick finally obtained the Radiance Spirit Pact Tree fruit from Ma’am Hermit, and he successfully concocted the Solar High Priest potion.
</p><br><p>It was golden in color and had a scorching hot temperature. When Derrick drank it, he felt the burning sensation in his throat.
</p><br><p>His eyes lit up suddenly as they grew brighter like there were two miniature suns hidden in them.
</p><br><p>His body radiated concentric ripples of pure light as his exposed skin protruded to form black patterns that were visible to the naked eye.
</p><br><p>At the same time, his body hair grew longer, as though they were changing into feathers that were swirling with golden flames.
</p><br><p>Derrick knew that there would be similar changes when consuming a potion at Sequence 7. He didn’t panic or become flustered. He clenched his teeth and repeatedly recalled that pain of him personally killing his parents and the hope that arose from the depths of his heart after meeting Mr. Fool. Despite being on the brink of losing control, he managed to persevere through it.
</p><br><p>After a while, everything abnormal about him was restored back to normal. However, the air he exhaled was mixed with the warmth of the sun.
</p><br><p>He felt that his body had become stronger again, and he had some considerable resistance against ailments and treacherous environments.
</p><br><p>However, that wasn’t the main point. Derrick liked the various theurgical knowledge that appeared in his mind.
</p><br><p>They included Fire of Light, Horror Immunity, Holy Oath, Cleave of Purification, Sun Halo, Holy Light Summoning, Holy Water Creation, etc.
</p><br><p>Derrick paced around in delight as he felt that the related theurgical spells he had were very suitable for him in dealing with the evil monsters that hid in the dark.
</p><br><p>He didn’t hide the news and immediately ran to the twin towers and recorded the information of his advancement.
</p><br><p>This way, after a preliminary inspection, he would have the qualifications to helm a small patrolling team as its captain. He could come into contact with more of the City of Silver’s information.
</p><br><p><i>This includes the method to removing the mental corruption of a Beyonder characteristic, which Mr. World wants... </i>While Derrick was answering the registration clerk’s various questions, he couldn’t help but recall the promise that he hadn’t been able to fulfill all this time.
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"></div><br><p>Owing something to others often left him uneasy and uncomfortable. And now, he could finally see the light that could restore his calm.
</p><br><p>...
</p><br><p>In the Amyris Leaf Bar, Wormtongue Mithor King was holding a cup of red wine. He sat across from the elderly Strongman Ozil, crossed his right leg, and leisurely asked, “Did you figure out anything specific?”
</p><br><p>He had been instructed by his captain, Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy, to return to Bayam and investigate the fake Helene. For this, he found Ozil who had originally issued the mission. He couldn’t directly seek out the Resistance, because there was a small chance that they were cooperating with the fake Helene. To question them in person was no different from directly bringing his head to the governor-general’s office in exchange for the bounty reward.
</p><br><p>Ozil pulled a chair and sat down.
</p><br><p>“They didn’t hide anything, but I can’t be sure if they’re speaking the truth or not. As you know, I prefer using fists rather than brains.
</p><br><p>“They said that Helene was brought over by Blazing Danitz. He represented Vice Admiral Iceberg and hoped to establish a cooperative relationship with the Resistance. They wanted to provide a certain amount of help, and Helene was a way to express their goodwill.”
</p><br><p>“Blazing Danitz? Vice Admiral Iceberg...” Mithor ruminated over the two names as his expression slowly turned solemn.
</p><br><p>He leaned back into his chair as he knitted his brows bit by bit.
</p><br><p>As one of Vice Admiral Hurricane’s former captains, he was now the third mate of Vice Admiral Ailment’s flagship. He was no stranger to the other pirate admirals, and he knew that Vice Admiral Iceberg was powerful and had a rich collection. With just one ship and a few subordinates, she was able to resist the other pirate admirals. In terms of strength, she was a little stronger than two of his bosses. More pertinently, Vice Admiral Iceberg seldom involved herself in the conflict between pirates. She sought information and explored the unknown to seek out treasure. She was more like an adventurer than a pirate.
</p><br><p><i>Why would she suddenly want to assassinate Captain? This doesn’t suit her character... She previously suffered a setback because of Admiral of Blood’s rumors. She should be focusing on seeking revenge on him... </i>Mithor took a sip of red wine as he rubbed his forehead with his other hand.
</p><br><p>He temporarily stopped thinking about Vice Admiral Iceberg, and he placed his attention on Blazing Danitz.
</p><br><p>As he carefully recalled, his pupils suddenly shrank. He discovered that there were some recent problems regarding this fourth boatswain of the Golden Dream he was familiar with.
</p><br><p><i>He laid a trap and killed Steel Maveti, Blood Brambles Hendry, and Calm Squall. His bounty was raised to 4,200 pounds, and in a short period of time, he got embroiled in some matter, causing his bounty to rise again, reaching 5,500 pounds. This has already exceeded my bounty... </i>Mithor thought to himself silently as Blazing Danitz’s figure surfaced before him. He found him mysterious and terrifying.
</p><br><p><i>He advanced? Or did he receive some great benefits because of something? </i>Mithor leaned forward and put down the cup.
</p><br><p>He whispered seriously, “I originally treated his bounty increase as a joke.
</p><br><p>“But reality has informed me that Blazing Danitz is a great pirate worthy of a 5,500-pound bounty!”
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"></div><br><p>Mithor looked up and said to Strongman Ozil, “Help me seek out intel on Blazing. The recent ones!”
</p><br><p>...
</p><br><p>In the luxurious suite in the Wind of Azure Inn.
</p><br><p>When Danitz opened the door and saw Gehrman Sparrow, he glanced around warily before making way.
</p><br><p>“How was it? Did the hunt succeed?” he asked in excitement and curiosity after closing the door.
</p><br><p><i>Vice Admiral Ailment is a famous beauty. Back when I saw her, she was even more charming than I imagined. What a pity if she were to just die like that. She should be locked up forever without parole... Pui! How can she be prettier than Captain? Those with looks like her are plenty in the Red Theater! </i>Contradictory thoughts ran through Danitz’s head.
</p><br><p>Klein clenched his fist and placed it to his mouth before coughing violently.
</p><br><p>After calming down, he answered coldly, “Almost.”
</p><br><p>“What a pity...” Danitz sighed.
</p><br><p>But deep down, he was thinking, <i>This madman, Gehrman Sparrow, is really strong!</i> </p><br><p><i>He infiltrated the Black Death to assassinate Vice Admiral Ailment but was only just fell short of success. Even though he failed, he successfully returned almost without any injuries!</i> </p><br><p>One had to know that the reason why every pirate admiral was famous throughout the Five Seas, being second only to the Four Kings, wasn’t only because they themselves were strong; it was also because they represented a crew, a force to be reckoned with. They had many Beyonders under them. To be able to escape from the Black Death after a failed assassination had indicated that Gehrman Sparrow was in no way weaker than any pirate admiral!
</p><br><p><i>Is Creeping Hunger really that powerful? No, even if I were in his shoes and had Creeping Hunger, I wouldn’t be able to go that far... </i>Danitz was increasingly convinced that his choice of not resisting during his first encounter with Gehrman Sparrow was extremely wise.
</p><br><p>Klein coughed twice again and prepared to instruct Danitz to buy some medicine for him from the hospital.
</p><br><p>He then recalled that the cause of his illness was complicated. The medicine provided to him without a doctor’s careful examination might not be effective. Even the many medicines that Emperor Roselle had previously invented were the same.
</p><br><p><i>If it wasn’t because it’s impossible to use the gray fog to establish a remote treating system, I really wish that I could consult Emlyn White to make me some medicine... </i>Klein went to the washroom to wash up and change into his original clothes and burn the clothes he obtained from the fisherman.
</p><br><p>Upon seeing him come out, Danitz went over with a paper bag and said in a sycophantic manner, “This is the 700 pounds they gave.”
</p><br><p>At this point, he and Klein heard someone knock on the door. It was Captain Elland.
</p><br><p>When the captain rushed into the room, he gave Gehrman Sparrow a deep look and suppressed his voice.
</p><br><p>“I planned on returning to Pritz Harbor, but I received a piece of intel.
</p><br><p>“Something huge seemed to have happened at Bansy Harbor.”</p>
