                        <div></div><p></p><br><p></p><h4>Chapter 1173 Advice</h4><br><p></p><br><p>Good question... The Fool Klein inwardly praised her, and he explained by using the Red Angel evil spirit’s explanation in his own words:
</p><br><p>“The seven deities wish to have a Black Emperor, but ‘They’ are not unanimous in their candidate for the Black Emperor.
</p><br><p>“When George III successfully obtained the ticket to becoming one through secret preparations, the seven deities had no choice but to accept it, regardless of whether they approved of ‘Him’ or not.”
</p><br><p>So that’s the situation... Apart from The Moon Emlyn and The Sun Derrick, the other members of the Tarot Club were enlightened. They roughly understood why the Churches acted in a rather contradictory manner when faced with the tragedies of the Great Smog of Backlund, the deaths caused by the Feysacian air raid, and George III’s assassination.
</p><br><p>Following that, they suddenly had a question:
</p><br><p>Since George III had already made preparations and had reached the final step of carrying out the ritual while obtaining the tacit approval of the seven deities, why would “He” fail?
</p><br><p>They immediately thought of an answer:
</p><br><p>Because Mr. Fool didn’t agree to it.
</p><br><p>Hmm... In the destruction of George III’s Black Emperor ritual, the Churches probably didn’t do anything to stop it. Perhaps, they even provided some help to Mr. Fool’s subordinates... Did the Church of the Lord of Storms make use of this chaos to secretly do something? No, they likely wouldn’t conceal it too much... Leonard recalled all the details he had previously discovered, and he was confident of his grasp over the overall situation.
</p><br><p>The seven deities’ tacit approval... Mr. Fool vetoed it and sent The World and other Blessed to secretly destroy George III’s apotheosis ritual... But what has this got to do with the Queen? Why did she discover that Gehrman Sparrow has gone missing? Hmm, Black Emperor... The Queen might’ve participated in the operation led by Mr. Fool, and later, discovered that a participant had gone missing... Cattleya made a guess at the truth through her rich knowledge and insight.
</p><br><p>And at this moment, Emlyn had just managed to make heads and tails of the discussions that had just been discussed, and he managed to understand the developments outside during his time in protective custody.
</p><br><p>George III had secretly plotted to become a god and received the seven deities’ tacit approval. In the end, Mr. Fool’s Blessed destroyed “His” ritual, causing him to die on the spot!
</p><br><p>Seeing that everyone was silent, The Fool Klein looked at The Hermit Cattleya and said, “Any other questions?”
</p><br><p>“There’s nothing else this time.” Cattleya bowed her head even lower. She was more respectful than before towards the mighty figure at the end of the long bronze table.
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"></div><br><p>Although she had long known that Mr. Fool had the Snake of Fate, Death Consul, and Ancient Bane under “Him,” and was in secret control of the Life School of Thought, she still never expected that the powers Mr. Fool could mobilize in the real world were able to destroy a king’s apotheosis ritual. Furthermore, “He” had foiled a plot of a King of Angels, the son of the Creator.
</p><br><p>Mr. Fool’s hidden forces are more exaggerated than I imagined... What effect do the members of the Tarot Club exert on “Him”? A backing faction? Individual growth? Or is it just a backup plan? Cattleya instantly thought of many things and momentarily forgot that she was already a Sequence 4 demigod. No matter which organization she was in, she was considered a member of the upper echelons.
</p><br><p>Just the feats displayed by Mr. Fool is enough to make a saint lack confidence... Justice Audrey only took a glance at Ma’am Hermit before she interpreted her mental state.
</p><br><p>At this moment, The Fool Klein nodded.
</p><br><p>“You may begin.”
</p><br><p>Upon hearing this, Leonard immediately turned to the other end of the long, mottled table and said to The World, “How’s your situation now?”
</p><br><p>Fors, Xio, Audrey, and the other members of the Tarot Club also cast their gazes over, expressing their concern for The World Gehrman Sparrow’s situation.
</p><br><p>From their point of view, Mr. World, who was stuck between Mr. Fool and Angel of Time Amon as a combat tool, was probably in a bad situation. His survival meant that he was already considered lucky enough.
</p><br><p>Feeling the varied concern, Klein controlled The World and chuckled hoarsely.
</p><br><p>“Not too bad, but not too good either.
</p><br><p>“It’s all thanks to Mr. Fool’s grace that I finally obtained a secret from Amon, but I haven’t completely escaped from ‘His’ grasp”
</p><br><p>Without waiting for everyone to respond, he continued, “I’m currently in a rather sticky situation.
</p><br><p>“I relied on Mr. Fool’s powers to enter a certain concealed state and temporarily extricate myself from Amon’s grasp. However, if I were to dispel this state and return to the real world, I’ll only find myself back where my body is. And it’s very likely that Amon is still loitering nearby.
</p><br><p>“I would like to make an attempt at finding a solution. I wonder what your opinions are regarding this matter?”
</p><br><p>The meaning behind The World Gehrman Sparrow’s words was very clear. He wanted to rely on himself first, leaving Mr. Fool’s help as a last resort.
</p><br><p>And his actual meaning was essentially the same: Find a way to bypass the restrictions first. And in the case that his solution didn’t really work, then he would consider living in the state of being undead.
</p><br><p>Solution? Alger and company were suddenly a little excited because the suggestions they provided would be used to fight against a King of Angels.
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"></div><br><p>If they were employed and were of use, then this would be a proud moment in their life, one that would remain for the rest of their lives!
</p><br><p>Audrey was just about to speak in excitement when she retracted her words. This was because she knew that she couldn’t give random suggestions; otherwise, it could lead to Mr. World getting caught by Amon.
</p><br><p>Xio thought about it seriously and realized that she couldn’t come up with any useful suggestions. She could only choose to observe and learn.
</p><br><p>“Must it be where your body originally was? Do you have any blood or hair that was kept elsewhere?” Alger thought for a moment and gave a suggestion using a question.
</p><br><p>The Fool Klein thought for a moment and made The World shake his head.
</p><br><p>“No.”
</p><br><p>Compared to his original body, a single tube of blood was too little.
</p><br><p>Thinking of this, Klein suddenly had an idea:
</p><br><p>Perhaps he could use those two tubes of blood as ingredients, combining them with other methods, using Alchemical Life to create a new body!
</p><br><p>There are two problems. Firstly, Alchemical Life requires the Spirit Body’s involvement; otherwise, the final product might not be considered my body. Secondly, I don’t know any demigods who can complete Alchemical Life. The only one barely related to them is Frank Lee... Will I end up becoming a mushroom man? Then, I’d be better off as an undead... As Klein thought about it, he nearly shivered.
</p><br><p>After The Hanged Man’s suggestion was rejected, The Hermit Cattleya set off from her knowledge of mysticism. She deliberated and asked, “Do you have a Sequence 3 Sealed Artifact?”
</p><br><p>“Why do you ask?” The World asked.
</p><br><p>“A Sequence 3 Sealed Artifact can respond to prayers within a certain range. You can make use of that,” Cattleya explained simply.
</p><br><p>Klein roughly understood what Ma’am Hermit was thinking.
</p><br><p>“You’re talking about ‘descent?’”
</p><br><p>“That’s right. Get someone to set up a descent ritual at the periphery, and you should be able to respond to it in your own concealed state.” Cattleya first glanced at The Sun and described the specific plan. Then, she realized something as she asked, “Do you really have a Sequence 3 Sealed Artifact?”
</p><br><p>She originally wanted The World to seek Mr. Fool’s bestowment.
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"></div><br><p>“I’m already a Sequence 3 Beyonder,” Klein replied simply as he controlled The World.
</p><br><p>“...” The members of the Tarot Club were momentarily speechless.
</p><br><p>They knew very well that Mr. World must’ve advanced to Sequence 4 at the end of June to become a demigod.
</p><br><p>And now, it was December of the same year!
</p><br><p>The Queen once said that using the blood of the Snake of Fate to advance would make it easier for me to become a Sequence 3 Clairvoyant than others... Besides, the Tarot Club has given me plenty of precious mysticism knowledge. It has greatly helped me digest the potion... But even so, I still need another half a year before I have a chance of attempting to reach Sequence 3... The Hermit Cattleya subconsciously looked around and discovered that the other members wore stupefied and envious looks.
</p><br><p>She sighed silently and said, “Is my suggestion useful, Mr. World?”
</p><br><p>The World Gehrman Sparrow shook his head.
</p><br><p>“There is a huge restriction when responding in that state.”
</p><br><p>Once he chose to descend, it would mean that he would begin the rest of his life—no, afterlife—as an undead.
</p><br><p>Perhaps, I can combine the two methods... Yes, I can use the method of praying to The Fool, Sea God, or Protector of magic and drama performers to leave the Forsaken Land of the Gods, but that’s not urgent. It’s too easy to reveal the truth... The Fool Klein made The World look at The Star Leonard while in thought.
</p><br><p>Leonard instantly understood what he meant. He tersely acknowledged.
</p><br><p>“I’ll go back and do some research to see if there are any other ideas.”
</p><br><p>Clearly, his true intention was to ask Old Man when he was back. “He” was an angel who knew Amon rather well. Perhaps, he could come up with suggestions that no one else could think of.
</p><br><p>This was the answer that Klein wanted. He immediately made The World say, “Okay.”
</p><br><p>After the discussion of how to escape his predicament came to an end, The World Gehrman Sparrow looked at Fors.
</p><br><p>“Help me ask the Abraham family if they still have any Worms of Cosmos that have yet to lose their spirituality. If there are, what will be the price for the exchange.”
</p><br><p>A Worm of Star was a high-level spiritual material. Most of the time, it didn’t contain any Beyonder characteristics. Therefore, their spirituality would suffer an irreversible loss. Without any special methods, it would be difficult to preserve it for too long.
</p><br><p>Worms of Cosmos... Fors was taken aback before she nodded.
</p><br><p>“Alright.”
</p><br><p>After receiving an answer, Klein made The World cast his gaze at The Hermit Cattleya.
</p><br><p>“If Miss Magician isn’t able to exchange for a Worm of Star from the Abraham family, I would like to entrust you with a mission.”
</p><br><p>“What mission?” Cattleya asked with interest.
</p><br><p>The World said with a smile, “Hunt the Aurora Order’s Saint of Secrets, Botis.”</p>
