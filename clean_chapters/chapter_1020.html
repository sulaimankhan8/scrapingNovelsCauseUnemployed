</p><br><p>And under a grapevine 150 meters from the manor’s main building, a slowly crawling centipede suddenly stiffened before it relaxed.
</p><br><p>Almost at the same time, its body vanished from its location. Dwayne Dante in his blue and white checkered pajamas had appeared.
</p><br><p>Klein had swapped places with his marionette again!
</p><br><p>He decided to use this method to secretly tail Qonas Kilgor and figure out where he was going or what he was planning on doing.
</p><br><p>Although he could only “move” 150 meters a time, and it took two to three seconds in between “moves” due to the process of turning the target into a marionette, this was more concealed compared to Flaming Jump or Teleport. It made it difficult for Qonas Kilgor to detect him.
</p><br><p>After all, he was dealing with a demigod. Even in domains where one’s spiritual intuition wasn’t the best, a demigod wasn’t to be underestimated!
</p><br><p>By the same logic, Klein didn’t rely on Creeping Hunger to hide in the shadows. This was because it was relatively slow even though it concealed him rather well. It was impossible for him to catch up to the demigod.
</p><br><p>Under the dark night sky, from Maygur Manor to the south bank of the Tussock River, the rats, snakes, spiders, fish that were active in that stretch of land stiffened up and turned sluggish.
</p><br><p>They were converted into marionettes one after another. With their help, Klein constantly “moved” without causing a stir. Soon, he arrived at the south bank of the Tussock River, and after catching up to Qonas Kilgor, he maintained a distance of one kilometer.
</p><br><p>To a Bizarro Sorcerer, even if a marionette were to go beyond his range of control, it wouldn’t immediately escape from its controlled state or die immediately. Without a Bizarro Sorcerer’s consciousness as a catalyst, this process was rather slow and needed nearly ten minutes. Therefore, Klein wasn’t worried that he would lose Enuni, who was lying in bed, while he did his tailing. As long as he returned within ten minutes, he could continue controlling his marionette.
</p><br><p>Silently, Klein followed Qonas Kilgor as they went upstream. Passing through the dense forest, they climbed up a mountain beside the bank.
</p><br><p>At this moment, Qonas Kilgor, who wasn’t wearing a vest or coat, suddenly stopped. He checked his surroundings and widened the range of his search as though he was trying to claim his territory.
</p><br><p>Upon seeing this, Klein didn’t dare stay any longer. He immediately switched places with his marionettes and retreated repeatedly, pulling away to a distance of nearly three kilometers from the deputy director of MI9.
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"></div><br><p>At this moment, he gave up control of the marionettes ahead of him. The death of a few bugs wouldn’t incur any suspicion.
</p><br><p>This was all too common in the outskirts and in the forests!
</p><br><p>King of the Five Seas Nast can create a fighting environment that’s favorable for him. Will Qonas Kilgor, who’s also a Black Emperor pathway demigod, have the ability to demarcate such a region. He can change, boost, and use certain rules and make whoever tails him expose themselves without being able to hide? It’s very possible! Klein warily took out a gold coin he placed in his pajama pocket. He ran it through his fingers and flipped it.
</p><br><p>This time, he deliberately controlled his strength and didn’t produce a flicking sound. The gold coin flew up in silence and landed in his palm.
</p><br><p>Without needing to look down, the gold coin’s face was naturally reflected in his mind.
</p><br><p>It was heads!
</p><br><p>This meant that the anomaly ahead contained extreme danger!
</p><br><p>As expected of a demigod. Such abilities sure are enviable... However, do you think you can avoid my “tailing”? Klein scoffed inwardly and found an abnormally secluded spot and made himself turn into Gehrman Sparrow.
</p><br><p>Following that, he clasped his hands and pressed it to his mouth, whispering:
</p><br><p>“Blessed of the sea and spirit world, guardian of the Rorsted Archipelago, ruler of the undersea creatures, master of tsunamis and storms, the great Kalvetua...”
</p><br><p>After praying, Klein immediately took four steps counterclockwise and arrived above the gray fog. He sat at The Fool’s seat and beckoned for the bone scepter with blue gems embedded at its tip.
</p><br><p>Then, with the help of his prayer, he utilized the Sea God Scepter’s responding to believers and saw the area around Gehrman Sparrow.
</p><br><p>He then raised his field of view and took in the surrounding area. Using this as the origin, he expanded his vision to five nautical miles. This was the limit of what the Sea God Scepter could observe with the help of its believers.
</p><br><p>And this way, the area where Qonas Klein had designated—one that no object could escape his notice-appeared in Klein’s vision.
</p><br><p>In the dock area, inside a warehouse with plenty of goods.
</p><br><p>“Love...” After Trissy chuckled, her figure grew faint as though she was bathed in the luster of a lake at night.
</p><br><p>In the blink of an eye, Trissy, who had been bound tightly with layers of silk by Demoness of Unaging Katarina Pelle, turned into an illusory mirror.
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"></div><br><p>It was a full-body mirror taller than a person. Aqueous light shimmered within as a ghostly halo grew out of it as though it was a door leading to another world.
</p><br><p>At that moment, it didn’t reflect the scene in front of it. Instead, it outlined a room.
</p><br><p>The room was dimly lit. The bed and furniture had been diced up into countless small pieces which were scattered everywhere. Only the central region was spick and span.
</p><br><p>Trissy stood there, wearing a dark black dress. Her hair cascaded down smoothly as it fluttered in the wind, accentuating her face’s abnormal fairness. She looked like a female ghost as spoken in folk tales.
</p><br><p>She wasn’t actually present and was using the illusory mirror to project her figure and strength remotely. It was as though everything was real.
</p><br><p>Therefore, she wasn’t flustered at all when she was being controlled and hunted.
</p><br><p>Upon seeing this scene, Katarina Pelle, who wore simple and holy white robes, didn’t hesitate to let out a shriek.
</p><br><p>Invisible waves quickly spread out as her hair flared up, each strand clear and distinct. They were thick and dyed with a grayish-white color.
</p><br><p>The illusory full-body mirror suddenly vibrated and shook as though it was on the brink of breaking apart.
</p><br><p>And in the messy room it reflected, the fragments of the bed, desk, and chairs turned grayish-white, losing their luster as though they were rocks.
</p><br><p>The brownish-yellow floor in front of Trissy turned into grayish-white rocks as it quickly extended towards the only human in the room like a surging tidal wave.
</p><br><p>Trissy didn’t attempt to resist as she turned around and waved her hand back while leaping towards the open window.
</p><br><p>In midair, invisible spider webs that belonged to her phased into existence. They turned dark as they spread towards the grayish-white colors.
</p><br><p>At the same time, the dark and profound full-body mirror produced one crack after another. Amidst illusory shattering sounds, it broke apart and vanished.
</p><br><p>However, before the full-body mirror completely vanished, the grayish-white colors receded in a strange manner inside the petrified room, materializing into a figure.
</p><br><p>The figure wore a simple, holy white robe and had luscious raven-black hair. She looked both mature and innocent, as though she had a pair of profound and childlike blue eyes. She was Demoness of Unaging Katarina who had just been inside the warehouse a moment ago.
</p><br><p>Viscount Stratford could no longer see the situation inside the “opposite” room once the ghostly glow dissipated.
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"></div><br><p>He retracted his gaze and cast it onto Shermane. He wore a mixed look in his eyes before he recovered.
</p><br><p>“Trissy really was patient. To deal with me, she actually spent months to nurture a new Demoness.” Viscount Stratford shook his head with a chuckle. “What did she want you to gain from me?”
</p><br><p>At that moment, with Trissy’s connection being severed, the spider webs around Shermane had loosened. They were unable to bind her and restrict her freedom.
</p><br><p>This beautiful girl wore a blank expression as she replied with a vacant look in her eyes, “She wanted me to know who you are truly loyal to.”
</p><br><p>Without waiting for Viscount Stratford to say a word, she asked hesitantly, her eyes making it obvious that she had difficulty finding the words:
</p><br><p>“How many of those promises that you made to me were real?”
</p><br><p>Viscount Stratford was taken aback before he chuckled.
</p><br><p>“You’re probably the most silly and most naive Demoness I’ve ever met...”
</p><br><p>Shermane’s expression froze on her face as the glimmer in her eyes that she found so hard to regain faded bit by bit.
</p><br><p>Outside the warehouse, Xio and Fors were hiding in the shadows, observing the silent target area.
</p><br><p>They had followed Viscount Stratford here!
</p><br><p>Their patience had paid off, as they discovered this captain of the royal guards secretly leaving his mansion in the dead of the night, rushing to the dock area near the Backlund Bridge.
</p><br><p>Using Xio’s power as a Sheriff, they followed him all the way here by keeping a huge distance between them. They had also confirmed that he had entered the warehouse in front of them.
</p><br><p>In addition, they also sensed that Viscount Stratford’s condition had worsened as though he had been injured.
</p><br><p>“Actually, we had the opportunity to take action while on our way here...” Fors looked at the warehouse’s entrance and murmured.
</p><br><p>Xio replied without looking at her, “But you said it yourself that you have a nagging feeling that things aren’t that simple and wanted to wait.”
</p><br><p>“This might be the intuition of an Astrologer. It might also be an act of procrastination...” Fors replied in a self- deprecating manner.
</p><br><p>They didn’t say anything more as silence ruled once more. They continued waiting patiently.
</p><br><p>At this moment, a pitch-black flame was ignited on the rammed earth in front of them.
</p><br><p>The strange flames rapidly dispersed and kept close to the ground as it swept away. It then outlined a row of Loenese text:
</p><br><p>“This is the chance you’ve been longing for.”
</p><br><p>Xio’s and Fors’s pupils dilated at the same time. Then, they looked at each other, at a loss for words. After a few seconds, Fors finally couldn’t help but ask, “What do we do?”</p>
