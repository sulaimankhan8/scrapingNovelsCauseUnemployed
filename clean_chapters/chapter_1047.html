</p><br><p>Enuni bowed and said, “He went to the washroom and will be back soon. Honorable lady, do you wish to wait here?”
</p><br><p>“Alright.” Audrey found a single-seater and sat dowoi with all sorts of thoughts running through her mind.
</p><br><p>Frankly speaking, if she only had to deal with Hvin Rambis, she had already come up with a concrete plan. It was to hypnotize herself in advance. When Hvin Rambis came to gather feedback, she would activate the The World Gehrman Sparrow’s charm without any ill intent. Then, she would work with the crazy adventurer to hunt the demigod.
</p><br><p>Humph, in order to ensure that there aren’t any problems, I can also make a request to Ma’am Hermit for help. She’s already a demigod and can lurk in the darkness. She can then combine forces with Mr. World at the critical moment. That way, Hvin Rambis likely wouldn’t be able to escape... Audrey pursed her lips as she held back from grinding her teeth.
</p><br><p>As for how The Hermit was to come to Backlund, she didn’t find it problematic. She could rent Leymano’s Travels and get Mr. World to record Teleport before requesting Mr. Fool to pass it to her.
</p><br><p>But this way, even if Hvin Rambis didn’t manage to escape, the Psychology Alchemists would have ample reason to suspect that the murderer was the last person the demigod had interacted with—Audrey herself.
</p><br><p>And this means that there would be countless troubles in the future... Audrey’s eyes shifted slightly as she tried hard to calm herself down.
</p><br><p>At that moment, the white-sideburned and elegant Dwayne Dantes returned from the washroom. He smiled and greeted the noble lady who was waiting for him.
</p><br><p>After letting his valet, Enuni, guard the door, this tycoon looked around before finally turning his gaze to Audrey.
</p><br><p>You seem to have encountered some difficulty?”
</p><br><p>Audrey didn’t interpret Mr. World’s actions and replied frankly, “Yes...”
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"></div><br><p>She gave a description of what she had encountered and said, “What should I do to solve the problem?”
</p><br><p>What she really meant was how she could avoid leaving behind any remnant problems for the future.
</p><br><p>Klein smiled and said, “Why don’t you discuss it with the two ladies?”
</p><br><p>That’s right! like Mr. Moon, we can request for a private mini-gathering... Oh, Judgment Xio, The Magician Fors will definitely participate. Apart from them, I can also invite Mr. World, Mr. Hanged Man, Ma’am Hermit, Mr. Moon—uh, I can count him out... Audrey felt excited for some baffling reason.
</p><br><p>At this moment, she felt as though she wasn’t fighting alone.
</p><br><p>“I understand.” Audrey nodded with a smile.
</p><br><p>She then thought of another problem and quickly took the opportunity to ask, “Hvin Rambis has made me no longer reject the princes and praise them in front of my parents. What’s his motive?”
</p><br><p>Klein thought for a moment and said, “Perhaps it’s to show some kind of friendliness on the surface. It’s to rope in your father and make a hint to the Church of Evernight behind him. Regardless of the king’s secret, whether it succeeds or not, he will definitely need at least one orthodox Church’s support so as to reduce the opposing forces.”
</p><br><p>“Is that so...” Audrey didn’t really reject Mr. World’s explanation. This was the politics she was familiar with if she stripped off the outer shell that involved Beyonder powers.
</p><br><p>She didn’t stay any longer and returned to her own office. After settling her daily affairs, she grasped her afternoon break and prayed to Mr. Fool and applied for a mini-gathering to be convened.
</p><br><p>Above the endless grayish-white fog, dark red beams rose up around the long bronze table.
</p><br><p>Audrey looked around, stood up, and curtsied to the other members.
</p><br><p>“Everyone, I have something I wish to hear from you.”
</p><br><p>“It sounds urgent,” Alger nodded gently and replied.
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"></div><br><p>Audrey sat down and said, “Yes.”
</p><br><p>She then looked at Xio and Fors.
</p><br><p>“I met Hvin Rambis this morning. He hypnotized me to do two things for him and to forget his appearance.
</p><br><p>“Fortunately, I was quite careful and cautious. I quickly discovered something odd, and thanks to Mr. Fool’s blessings, I remembered everything.
</p><br><p>“One of the things Hvin Rambis asked me to do was to arrange for a meeting with Miss Magician and Miss Judgment and take the opportunity to hypnotize them. I’ll then obtain intel on the instigator for the actions they had recently taken and also get them to leave Backlund as quickly as possible.”
</p><br><p>What? Fors was originally worried about Miss Justice’s safety, but she never expected things to make one rotation before coming back at her and Xio!
</p><br><p>To think they targeted Miss Audrey. It’s really hard to guard against them! She’s targeted by a demigod... After a moment of shock, Fors felt more astonished and afraid.
</p><br><p>She couldn’t help but look at her friend and saw Xio sitting calmly, but her hands had unconsciously clenched into fists.
</p><br><p>Cattleya didn’t understand something as she frowned and asked, “The Psychology Alchemists, or should I say Hvin Rambis, discovered that Miss Judgment and Miss Judgment are members of our Tarot Club?”
</p><br><p>This was a very serious and crucial matter.
</p><br><p>Audrey shook her head and said, “No, it’s only because I know them in the real world.”
</p><br><p>At that moment, she no longer tried to hide her identity from Fors and Xio.
</p><br><p>In fact, ever since Xio joined the club and obtained the Judgment card, Audrey knew that she would be exposed sooner or later. Through repeated observations, she had confirmed that her two friends had already guessed it, but they tacitly didn’t expose her.
</p><br><p>“You know them?” Cattleya asked in surprise as she adjusted her heavy glasses.
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"></div><br><p>Audrey nodded.
</p><br><p>“Yes, they were actually recommended by me. Mr. Hanged Man can testify...”
</p><br><p>Ah? Didn’t we chant Mr. Fool’s honorific name because we wanted to save ourselves and get pulled in here? How did it become a recommendation process? Fors looked at Miss Justice blankly before glancing at Xio, her face blank and confused.
</p><br><p>Xio also had that rare, similar expression because the word “recommended” had exceeded what she knew as well as her speculations.
</p><br><p>Audrey felt a little embarrassed. She blinked and explained to her two friends:
</p><br><p>“Because all of you have your own special qualities, and I also hoped that the Tarot Club will develop and expand, I recommended the two of you to Mr. Fool. However, this was just a chance for you. If you hadn’t passed Mr. Fool’s test, ‘He’ wouldn’t have pulled you in.”
</p><br><p>Test? What kind of test did I undergo? Fors was still confused. As for Xio, she thought of many things, especially the origins of the paper that had Mr. Fool’s honorific name, as well as her frantic search for an exorcism.
</p><br><p>No wonder I had an inkling that they knew each other... No wonder Miss Judgment only entered the club after so long. This was probably due to their different individual experiences... Each of them has their own specialties. This “specialty” is the selection criteria? Do I have one? Cattleya came to a realization as she came up with a theory.
</p><br><p>Upon seeing this, Alger, who had some level of judgment regarding this, wasn’t at all surprised as he chuckled and said, “We can talk about this in the future. Miss Justice, the problem you would like to ask about is how to deal with Hvin Rambis?”
</p><br><p>“Yes.” Audrey returned to the topic and asked seriously, “If we not only have to deal with Hvin Rambis’ but aW the Psychology Alchemists from suspecting me, what should I do?”
</p><br><p>Alger didn’t have any experience in dealing with a demigod, so all he could do was rely on his insight that had been built up over the years. He deliberated and said, “Lock onto the whereabouts of Hvin Rambis. Only take action after he has interacted with someone else?”
</p><br><p>“How do I lock onto him?” Audrey asked the question herself before giving the answer. “After getting the answer from Miss Judgment and Miss Magician, I’ll wait until Hvin Rambis leaves after I meet him again. Then, I’ll recite Mr. Fool’s honorific name and ask ‘Him’ to cast ‘His’ gaze on the demigod?”
</p><br><p>Theoretically it’s possible. My true vision above the gray fog has a radius of nearly ten kilometers. As long as Hvin Rambis doesn’t know Teleport, I can confirm his location and trajectory for a short period of time. Then, I can return to the real world and directly “Teleport” over. Hmm, this will require the help of divination... But the problem is that it requires The Fool to personally intervene... As The World Gehrman Sparrow, Klein said in a hoarse voice, “Let me remind you of something. Miss Judgment and Miss Magician had mentioned Adam in the real world. The Psychology Alchemists originated from the ruins of Hermes who is a member of the Twilight Hermit Order. And Mr. Fool doesn’t wish to be at odds with the Twilight Hermit Order because of this matter. Even if we were to do anything, we must try not to let the other party know.”
</p><br><p>This string of words contained a lot of information that made Alger, Cattleya, and the rest feel like they were seriously experiencing a literal brainstorm. Xio and Fors were even more shocked.
</p><br><p>So that organization is called the Twilight Hermit Order... Mr. Fool doesn’t want to be its enemy over this matter. Is it because “He” had just finished collaborating with the Angel of Imagination Adam over the matter of Ince Zangwill? I never expected the Psychology Alchemists to be related to the Twilight Hermit Order... Wait, Hermes? H-he’s still alive? He’s actually a member of the Twilight Hermit Order? Th-the members of this organization are really unimaginably important figures? Alger first glanced at Gehrman Sparrow before failing to resist the urge to look at Cattleya.
</p><br><p>He realized that the latter was equally shocked without hiding it.
</p><br><p>“The Twilight Hermit Order... Is this the ancient secret organization that Emperor Roselle joined?” Cattleya mumbled to herself as if she was seeking confirmation.
</p><br><p>Gehrman Sparrow gave the answer:
</p><br><p>“Yes.
</p><br><p>“After you return to the real world, it’s best if you don’t think about matters like this again. You’ll easily be detected. If you don’t trust yourself, you can get Miss Justice to give you some psychological cues.”</p>
