</p><br><p>He glanced at the area beyond the veranda as the downpour grew in intensity. He couldn’t help but think, How should I punish Ernes? Although he had done so because he likely followed orders or a cue, it’s still despicable!
</p><br><p>As for Lord Nibbs... I presently do not have the ability. But wait, once I become a marquis or a duke, I’ll definitely make him pay the price!
</p><br><p>Miss Magician has already completed her exploration of the ancient abandoned castle. I’m not sure if Lord Nibbs had sent Sanguine to monitor the area... From her tone, description, and the feedback given by Mr. Fool, there was probably no monitors... Could it be that Lord Nibbs didn’t send any Sanguine to the vicinity of the ancient castle? But what’s the point of such a test? Or could it be that they missed it because of some problems?
</p><br><p>Amidst his thoughts, Emlyn White felt that he needed to get someone to discuss the matter of punishing Ernes Boyar. He was severely lacking in such experience.
</p><br><p>Subconsciously, the first candidate of choice that came to him was The Hanged Man. This senior member of the Tarot Club was shown to be extremely experienced in various matters. He was extraordinarily reliable and had never left the other members disappointed.
</p><br><p>After hesitating for a few seconds, Emlyn struck down this choice. This was because this matter involved the Sanguine’s internal test. To consult the Tarot Club members before he obtained an answer damaged his pride and overall image of the Sanguine!
</p><br><p>By the same reason, he eliminated The World as a choice.
</p><br><p>Of course, he believed he could guess the suggestion that The World would give: Kill him!
</p><br><p>There’s no need to go that far... Emlyn mumbled inwardly. As he aimlessly tailed Ernes Boyar, he began expanding the candidates to the real world.
</p><br><p>Then, he realized he didn’t have anyone to choose from. He almost had zero friends.
</p><br><p>Eliminating his parents who were Sanguine as well, he only had two or three people in mind. They were the Harvest Church’s Father Utravsky and Detective Sherlock Moriarty, who had a mysterious background and a myriad of means at his disposal.
</p><br><p>Sherlock hasn’t returned after leaving Backlund. Sigh, I can only seek out Father Utravsky tomorrow. But I can’t be that direct... Emlyn quickly made up his mind. He walked past Ernes Boyar, who entered a watch shop, and headed for the end of the veranda where there were several rental carriages.
</p><br><p>Getting in the carriage, he felt the wheels turning. He casually glanced out the window and saw more raindrops striking the glass, drawing out trails that streaked down.
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"></div><br><p>In his blurred vision, carriages drove past.
</p><br><p>Audrey retracted her gaze from the rainy scene outside the carriage and glanced at her lady’s maid, Annie, before communicating with Susie silently.
</p><br><p>The look in her eyes, her expression, and her not obvious body language said: We’re almost home. I’m a little nervous.
</p><br><p>On the ground, Susie shook her tail, raised her paw, and adjusted the gold-rimmed glasses hanging by her neck. Together with the changes in the colors of her Ether Body and Body of Heart and Mind, she expressed herself:
</p><br><p>Don’t worry. That Ma’am Escalante, who’s a psychiatrist on the surface, is only a Telepathist. She won’t be able to see through your lies.
</p><br><p>Audrey nodded gently and watched her carriage enter the Hall family’s luxurious villa and stop in front of the sheltered foyer.
</p><br><p>Ever since joining the Loen Charity Bursary Foundation, she had begun spending less time at home. She had originally planned on meeting Ma’am Escalante from the Psychology Alchemists at 22 Phelps Street in North Borough, but since Mr. Dwayne Dantès had left for the Southern Continent and wasn’t in the foundation, there was no need for that.
</p><br><p>In the study she called her own, Audrey met Ma’am Escalante Oseleka who had black hair reaching her waist and a baby face.
</p><br><p>“I must apologize. I’d been busy meeting up with friends after returning to Backlund. My subsequent joining of the Loen Charity Bursary Foundation has delayed my meeting with you until today.” After leaving Susie outside, Audrey elegantly bowed to express her attitude. In fact, this has been deliberate. By dragging out their meeting for about a month, her digestion of the Psychiatrist potion and advancement to Hypnotist became rather reasonable. It was the progress one would expect from a genius and nothing else.
</p><br><p>Escalante returned the greeting without much thought.
</p><br><p>“I heard that you have been busy with children who desire knowledge. Your virtues are more dazzling than diamonds.”
</p><br><p>As Audrey gestured for her to sit, she walked to a single-seater and tersely acknowledged.
</p><br><p>“Those children are in situations I’ve never seen before. There’s often a voice inside me that’s urging me to do something. Ma’am Escalante, if you’re free, you can join me and the staff of the Loen Charity Bursary Foundation to go visit the different schools. There, you will get to see what most children in the world are experiencing.”
</p><br><p>Having said that, she chuckled as though being self-deprecatory.
</p><br><p>“I apologize. I’ve recently been accustomed to kick-start such topics. It’s because I wish for more nobles and the wealthy to involve themselves in such charities. I hope they can donate more to help even more children.”
</p><br><p>After hearing Audrey, Escalante replied somewhat uncomfortably, “I will do so. I’ll also donate some money to the Loen Charity Bursary Foundation.”
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"></div><br><p>“No, I’m not forcing you to donate. This has to be an action that comes from the heart, and something voluntary. I only wish for you to take a look and then inform the people around you of these children’s plight and their possible futures. This includes the members of the Psychology Alchemists.” Audrey shook her head, rejecting Escalante’s suggestion.
</p><br><p>“Alright.” Escalante first nodded gently in agreement before feeling that there was something ridiculous in this matter: Miss Audrey’s true motives were to solicit donations from the Psychology Alchemists.
</p><br><p>But this was a secret, extraordinary underground organization!
</p><br><p>This was no different from soliciting donations from the Aurora Order!
</p><br><p>Audrey didn’t continue discussing matters related to the Loen Charity Bursary Foundation. Instead, she said, “Ma’am Escalante, I have something I’d like to inform you of.”
</p><br><p>“What is it?” Escalante “read” the solemnity, joy, and pride from her actions and emotions.
</p><br><p>Audrey smiled and said, “I’ve already become a Hypnotist.”
</p><br><p>“...” At that moment, Escalante suspected that Audrey had hypnotized her.
</p><br><p>Although she knew that Audrey had obtained the Hypnotist potion formula previously, how long ago was that?
</p><br><p>“You should be able to determine that I’m not lying,” Audrey said with a smile.
</p><br><p>Only then did Escalante snap to her senses as she asked in surprise and doubt, “You seem to have some extraordinary encounter?”
</p><br><p>“It’s to have the courage to make use of matters,” Audrey said things that couldn’t be any truer.
</p><br><p>Escalante frowned and said with some hesitation, “You wish for the Sequence 5 potion formula?”
</p><br><p>“Yes. What do I need to do, or what price needs to be paid?” Audrey didn’t hide her motives.
</p><br><p>Escalante looked at the beautiful, blonde, and green-eyed lady in front of her and deliberated.
</p><br><p>“This isn’t something that’s up to me to decide. I will report it and try to arrange for you to meet with Hilbert and Stephen.”
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"></div><br><p>She was referring to psychologist ad jewelry designer, Hilbert Alucard, and furniture merchant, Stephen Hampres.
</p><br><p>Clearly, in this group of Psychology Alchemists members, Escalante was in a subordinate position.
</p><br><p>Audrey wasn’t surprised by Escalante’s reaction, but this didn’t mean that her handling of matters wasn’t without a problem.
</p><br><p>A Sequence 6 Beyonder who had the wish to advance was someone that required deep importance to be attached to in any secret organization. This was even the case with the orthodox Churches. They were people who were qualified to meet high-ranking members directly!
</p><br><p>This also meant that, after advancing to Hypnotist, Audrey was already an elite in the middle-ranking members of the Psychology Alchemists. Her next goal was to become a quasi high-ranking member. The person she needed to meet was a councilor of the Psychology Alchemists’ Council, and not Hilbert or Stephen.
</p><br><p>As her thoughts flashed across her mind, Audrey deliberately showed some of her displeasure.
</p><br><p>Escalante acutely noticed this and hurriedly explained, “Meeting Hilbert and Stephen is to confirm your condition before a councilor meets you.
</p><br><p>“In fact, with your present level, you should be leading a team and recruiting new members. But with your identity, status, and daily environment, we have canceled that plan, afraid that it would influence your normal day-to-day life.”
</p><br><p>Councilor... I wonder how many councilors from the Psychology Alchemists there are in Backlund... Could it be the royal family’s consultant, Hvin Rambis? Audrey nodded in thought and said, “I can understand that and will await your arrangements.”
</p><br><p>She then diverted the topic and asked with a curious look, “Ma’am Escalante, do you know what’s the name of the Sequence 5 potion of the Spectator pathway?”
</p><br><p>Seeing this blonde, green-eyed, young noble lady taking on such a demure pose, Escalante silently heaved a sigh of relief.
</p><br><p>“I’ve once heard Hilbert mention that it’s called Dreamwalker.”
</p><br><p>Dreamwalker... This is somewhat different from what I imagined. Or it could be that “dream” is just an analogy. To be precise, it should be Subconscious Walker? Audrey didn’t conceal her contemplation and analysis before directing her questions to psychology and various information.
</p><br><p>After having Escalante stay for dinner, she sent the lady to the door where she got on a carriage.
</p><br><p>At this moment, it was dark outside with gales roaring and rain pouring.
</p><br><p>Amidst the pouring rain, howling winds, and the dark night, a steam sailboat hybrid was cruising through the safe sea route in the Berserk Sea with tourists on board.
</p><br><p>Klein had already left the Southern Continent and had returned to Desi Bay as Dwayne Dantès.
</p><br><p>Amidst the shaking ship, he suddenly woke up, got out of bed, and headed to the window of his first-class cabin’s living room to look outside.
</p><br><p>Amidst the downpour, three huge strange pure-black sailboats were silently cruising over.
</p><br><p>Hanging on their sides were lanterns with three black sails on masts almost a hundred meters long.
</p><br><p>And on its deck stood a mottled stone chair that was two to three meters high; its back facing the cabin. No one was sitting on it.
</p><br><p>It was the Black Emperor-symbol of the King of the Five Seas, Nast!</p>
