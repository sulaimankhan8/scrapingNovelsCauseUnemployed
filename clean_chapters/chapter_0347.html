</p><br><p>Running ahead of the group was Maric. His disheveled hair was completely blown back by the wind, and his expression was twisted and hideous.
</p><br><p>He was even faster than a steam locomotive at its peak speed. With a whoosh, he arrived at the entrance to the clearing.
</p><br><p>But even so, he was still unable to escape from his pursuers.
</p><br><p>The closest figure to him was a man who had the same pale complexion as himself, with indistinct, dark patches on his face, as if they were healing marks from rotting wounds. The malice in his eyes was completely undisguised and unrestrained. He looked more like a zombie who was craving fresh flesh rather than a human being, and Klein guessed that he was Jason, a Sequence 6.
</p><br><p>The distance between Jason and Maric remained within seven or eight meters, sometimes lengthening; sometimes shortening. This repeated again and again, as they ventured back and forth.
</p><br><p>More than ten meters behind them, a figure was left far behind. It was a thin but muscular man; his hair was shaved very short, and his hair stood erect like spikes.
</p><br><p>As he swung his arms, the tip of his palms flashed with a metallic light, reflecting the weak crimson moonlight. Those were black fingernails which were as long as daggers!
</p><br><p><i>Werewolf Tyre... </i>Klein chanted the person’s Sequence and name silently. In his mind, the wall that was splashed with blood appeared in his mind. It was a scene with intestines and limbs splattered all over the ground.
</p><br><p><i>Tap! Tap! Tap!</i> </p><br><p>Maric used all his strength as he ran while Jason gritted his teeth and ran as fast as he could. At some point, the healed dark spots on his face began to swell, as if some sort of rotten liquid was about to ooze out.
</p><br><p>The two of them left the puddles of water and moist soil that were turning into white frost in their wake.
</p><br><p>The withered weeds were lifted up by the wind created by the two of them. As they slowly fell down, they began to rot and decay at a speed visible to the naked eye.
</p><br><p>Suddenly, a pale hand reached out of the frosted soil and accurately grabbed Jason’s ankle.
</p><br><p><i>Pa!</i> </p><br><p>Jason twisted his body and forcefully kicked out, breaking the hand’s wrist and sending it flying. The remaining stump’s flesh and blood had long since rotten, and white maggots struggled to squirm outwards.
</p><br><p>Maric stopped, pinched his lips with his right hand, and let out a shrill whistle.
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"></div><br><p><i>Bang! Bang! Bang!</i> </p><br><p>The soil in different parts of the clearing were lifted, and the expressionless corpses sat up.
</p><br><p>At the same time, a chilly wind suddenly swirled. Countless transparent shadows seemed to have caught the scent of a bloody feast, and none of them wanted to fall behind as they rushed towards Jason. Some pulled his arms, some pulled his calves, and some even hugged his head.
</p><br><p>Jason stopped and grunted.
</p><br><p>The shadows flew out, one after another—some of them screamed miserably and disappeared, while others stayed in their original spots, lost.
</p><br><p>At almost the same time, Maric and Jason both raised their right hands, thumbs held up beside their forefingers, with their index fingers aiming at each other.
</p><br><p>Silently, the air between them exploded as black wisps of air billowed upwards.
</p><br><p>Maric took a step back, and a few strands of his disheveled hair withered in a blink of an eye and fluttered to the ground.
</p><br><p>“Maric, you’re still so weak. You still don’t understand how to use the power of desire!” Jason said with a low, hoarse laugh.
</p><br><p>At this moment, Werewolf Tyre had already arrived at his side. As for Steve, the Sequence 5 Beyonder in charge of the operation, was nowhere to be found.
</p><br><p>“Don’t be in such a hurry to finish off Maric. Wait for Sharron to come and save him, Lord Steve is about to arrive,” Werewolf Tyre whispered to Jason.
</p><br><p>He then extended his bright red tongue and licked his lips.
</p><br><p>“I wonder what Sharron will look like when she has her clothes off...”
</p><br><p>Before he could finish his sentence, he suddenly saw Jason turn his head. His face was deathly pale, and there were two identical figures in his eyes.
</p><br><p>Black regal dress, light blonde hair, exquisite face, and pale skin!
</p><br><p><i>Pa!</i> </p><br><p>He struck out with both palms and gripped Werewolf Tyre’s neck. The creaking sound of bones giving way sounded out.
</p><br><p>Wraith Sharron had attacked!
</p><br><p>Tyre inhaled sharply, making his neck bulge like a water pipe. It grew strands of stiff black hair and briefly resisted the force that would snap his windpipe and neck.
</p><br><p>His eyes gradually rolled backward, showing its whites as his red tongue hung out and sticky saliva drooled down his lips.
</p><br><p>However, his right hand had accurately reached into his pocket. He had cracked a preset spirituality seal!
</p><br><p>The empty clearing, together with the warehouses, suddenly lit up as crimson moonlight filled the entire area.
</p><br><p>Jason’s grip on Werewolf Tyre’s neck began to weaken, and a figure in a small, soft hat appeared behind him.
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"></div><br><p>Tyre’s face broke into a smile that was both smug and cruel. His right hand took out a miniature “full moon” from his pocket, a crimson “full moon!”
</p><br><p>It was a dark red accessory that constantly emitted a serene luster. Shaped like a full moon, it had crimson rubies embedded along its circumference. In the middle was a symbol that symbolized the moon, as well as many other mysterious labels.
</p><br><p>Sharron narrowed her eyes instinctively and retreated two steps back. Her incorporeality slowly receded.
</p><br><p>Her legs no longer seemed capable of supporting her weight. She fell limply to the ground, her black and complicated regal dress stained with dust and mud.
</p><br><p>Werewolf Tyre raised the palm-sized round accessory high up into the air, laughing as he gasped for breath.
</p><br><p>“Lord Steve was right. You would definitely attempt to counterattack. And Sharron, your target for possession would definitely be Jason, whose Sequence is higher than mine. Therefore, the Scarlet Lunar Corona was given to me.
</p><br><p>“Guess, where is he now?”
</p><br><p><i>This... This isn’t as Sharron had expected... It seems like I can only choose the best opportunity to strike myself... </i>Klein frowned as he heard this, and he forcefully suppressed the anxiety in his heart.
</p><br><p>At this point, Werewolf Tyre was in no hurry to attack. He knew that the longer the effects of the Scarlet Lunar Corona lasted, the weaker Sharron would become, and the more Maric would be in pain.
</p><br><p>In Jason’s cold eyes, which usually had a hint of savagery and madness, there was no longer any rationality in them left.
</p><br><p>He was also affected by the Scarlet Lunar Corona, but he was used to indulging in his desires, so he didn’t feel any pain. Instead, he felt a thirst for the fresh flesh before his eyes.
</p><br><p><i>Gasp!</i> </p><br><p>Jason let out a low, inhuman growl from his throat. His exposed skin and hair turned white.
</p><br><p>At that moment, Sharron raised her arms with difficulty and used her left hand to remove the black glove that she wore on her right palm. Jason happened to lunge at her, and a thin layer of ice covered the soil around her!
</p><br><p>Suddenly, endless rays of light burst forth from Sharron’s palm.
</p><br><p>As they fed on Sharron’s spirituality, they interweaved in front of the doll-like lady to form a bronze door, which was covered with mysterious patterns and filled with an indescribable smell.
</p><br><p>The door swung open with a creak and a crack appeared!
</p><br><p>From the crack, pairs of pale or transparent hands or arms covered in teeth or bloody, skinless arms, stretched out, crossed the void, and grabbed Zombie Jason!
</p><br><p>Indescribable pairs of eyes were hidden in the darkness behind the door, quietly watching the prey in front of them.
</p><br><p>Before he could even react, Jason was grabbed by the arms, and he was entangled by smooth and incorporeal tentacles! These tentacles were dark-green vines that had countless baby faces protruding out!
</p><br><p>These strange entities were crying and laughing as they tried to drag Zombie Jason behind the door.
</p><br><p>Even though his thoughts were completely controlled by his bloodlust and the urge to kill, Jason instinctively felt afraid.
</p><br><p><i>Gasp!</i> </p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"></div><br><p>The sound from his throat suddenly intensified, and layers of frost immediately appeared on the worrisome-looking arm. The dark-green vines that protruded from the babies’ faces emitted painful groans as they continuously dripped with decayed, turbid yellow liquid.
</p><br><p>The pulling force abated, but it did not disappear.
</p><br><p>Jason kept directing ghosts to interfere, but it was like throwing a stone into the sea. Even when he tried to use spells from Death’s domain, they failed to deliver any striking results.
</p><br><p>His body began moving uncontrollably towards the crack of the illusory mysterious door. Occasionally, he would manage to struggle and retreat a little.
</p><br><p>As he had taken a sedative in advance, Maric was not completely taken down by the pain. Taking advantage of this, he took out the last two sedatives, broke the bottle with a snap, and drank one and a half glasses in one go.
</p><br><p>The suppressed malice in his eyes weakened, and his twisted expression returned to normal. He swept his gaze at Werewolf Tyre.
</p><br><p>At the same time, with a swoosh, Tyre’s thin but muscular body disappeared and reappeared more than ten meters away.
</p><br><p>As his figure began outlining itself, an illusory image was left behind. A black aura that seemed to be alive rose up from the ground, pierced through the remnant images, and disappeared with a flicker.
</p><br><p>Tyre hadn’t used Blink, as his Sequence didn’t have the corresponding Beyonder powers to do so.
</p><br><p>He had relied on the Scarlet Lunar Corona to push him to his maximum speed!
</p><br><p>The speed at which he moved at produced afterimages!
</p><br><p>At that moment, Klein, who was hiding in the shadows at the top of the warehouse, also reached into his pocket with his left hand, touching the iron cigarette case. He removed its surface spirituality cage and gently opened the case.
</p><br><p>He was sure that Wraith Steve had already arrived at the scene; otherwise, Jason definitely would’ve been dragged behind the terrible door if the deadlock continued. As for Wraith Tyre, despite being augmented by the Scarlet Lunar Corona, he was unable to instantly finish Maric off. When Sharron aimed the Door of Mysteries at the Werewolf, the Scarlet Lunar Corona would end up changing owners.
</p><br><p>As soon as Klein’s fingers touched the All-Black Eye inside the metal cigarette case, his mind filled with crazy, foul, and terrifying ravings!
</p><br><p>There were terrifying ravings that made his blood vessels bulge. He felt as though his eyes were cracking, and his head could explode at any moment.
</p><br><p>And in the midst of these ravings, Klein saw strange, mysterious, and illusory black threads. They were divided into groups, some of them extending to Sharron’s body, some of them from Werewolf Tyre. They intertwined with each other without entangling themselves as they extended into the void.
</p><br><p>Among them, many of the black lines came from a spot not far away from Maric, and they didn’t overlap!
</p><br><p><i>Wraith Steve! He wants to possess Maric! </i>With a thought, Klein retracted his left hand.
</p><br><p>Instead of drawing his gun to shoot, he snapped his fingers without making much of a sound.
</p><br><p><i>Boom!</i> </p><br><p>An explosion suddenly occurred between the two warehouses. The raging flames and heat caused a figure wearing a black double-breasted frock coat to float out.
</p><br><p>After catching the attention of the others, Klein quickly drew his gun and pulled the trigger at the spot he remembered.
</p><br><p>At the same time, the dark golden Sunbird brooch on his chest flashed with a ray of light.
</p><br><p>He added Cleave of Purification to the purifying bullet!
</p><br><p><i>Bang!</i> </p><br><p>The bullet shot out with a faint golden beam of light.</p>
