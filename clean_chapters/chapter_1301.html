</p><br><p>She was unable to prophesize anything from it. Having no choice but to look away, she followed her intuition and made the Invisible Servant walk towards the other end of the open area, which was also part of the primitive forest filled with towering trees.
</p><br><p>As the Invisible Servant couldn’t be too far away from her, she silently followed behind while wearing the Invisibility Hat. She unhurriedly passed through the area where all the creatures on the island were gathered.
</p><br><p>Here, the sky seemed to be perpetually gloomy, one permeated by a faint blackness.
</p><br><p>Time passed quickly. The Invisible Servant entered the forest that blotted out the sky with the tree branches and everything before it suddenly dimmed.
</p><br><p>Right on the heels of that, the nearly transparent, cold, and undetectable Eyes of Mystery Prying saw through the dim environment. There were pale-white corpses placed in between the trees. Skulls and rotting corpses hung down from many branches.
</p><br><p>They consisted of dragons, avian creatures, and some had eight legs, while others were strange giant trees that occupied every empty spot in the forest.
</p><br><p>At a glance, Bernadette seemed to have arrived at a cemetery. A scene naturally surfaced in her mind:
</p><br><p>It was a scene of supernatural beings giving birth to their descendants before they died, thus passing on their Beyonder characteristics to them. And these creatures would struggle towards this region in the primitive forest from every direction, in search of an unoccupied spot. Then, facing a particular direction, they would silently die, gradually rotting and being reduced to bones.
</p><br><p>What’s the meaning behind this? As a Clairvoyant, Bernadette fully believed that the scenes produced in her mind were what had happened in the real world. However, she was puzzled about the type of power that made the creatures on this primitive island choose this area as their tomb.
</p><br><p>Furthermore, since Grimm, William, and Poli, who had died long ago, appeared to remain alive in some form, it didn’t make sense that supernatural and mutated creatures that had stayed on this island all this while and had suffered even more corruption would end up dying.
</p><br><p>This made Bernadette frown slightly as she directed the Invisible Servant to continue proceeding deeper into the creature cemetery.
</p><br><p>Just like that, the Invisible Servant proceeded forward for nearly fifteen minutes in this forest filled with bones and corpses.
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"></div><br><p>Finally, it saw a fourth object beyond trees, weeds, and corpses.
</p><br><p>It was a black stone pillar. It was very thick, with a width spanning about six arm spans, and thirty to forty meters tall. Its surface was covered with rings which were signs of weathering. It resembled a finger wearing rings that didn’t suit its size.
</p><br><p>Bernadette made the Eyes of Mystery Prying observe the stone pillar for several seconds, but she didn’t discover anything mysterious about it. It was as though it was a symbol that was casually erected.
</p><br><p>The Invisible Servant looked around and discovered that the surrounding corpses around the stone pillar didn’t suffer from serious rot. They were even covered in rather intact flesh and skin.
</p><br><p>There aren’t any supernatural powers or magical effects that are different from other places... Unless the new deceased were gathered near the stone pillar, it’s impossible for them to have such a unified trend... Bernadette suspected that it wasn’t because there was no mysterious influence in this matter, but that it would only happen at a specific moment.
</p><br><p>She didn’t use her powers of prophecy to search for the reason. This was because a prophecy, at its core, was to pry into the secrets of the river of fate. The more serious the problem involved was, and the higher her status and level, the more damage the backlash would bring to her. And at this moment, it was impossible for Bernadette to not be cautious. She was afraid that it might involve an unknown existence.
</p><br><p>In addition, this hadn’t caused any harm to her. She didn’t have to take the risk to make a “prophecy.”
</p><br><p>After searching for a while to no avail, the Invisible Servant continued forward, attempting to pass through the cemetery and head to other regions of the forest.
</p><br><p>Just then, Bernadette heard a rustling sound.
</p><br><p>It was the sound of a breeze passing through the vegetation, a tidal wave in the void.
</p><br><p>Ever since she landed on this strange island, this was Bernadette’s first time feeling the wind.
</p><br><p>Subconsciously, she made the invisible servant look back at the black stone pillar.
</p><br><p>In the Eyes of Mystery Prying, the corpses around the stone pillar began to rot and shed one by one. New flesh and blood grew out like they had their own spirituality, and their skin slowly covered this harrowing scene one inch at a time.
</p><br><p>This change lasted for less than ten seconds before stopping. A small number of the corpses no longer showed any signs of decay. It looked like they had just died.
</p><br><p>In the next second, a mutated curly-haired baboon and a wolf with eight legs wobbled to their feet.
</p><br><p>Their fur was slightly white and their skin was slightly dry, their eyes dull and cold.
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"></div><br><p>Then, the two originally deceased creatures each got their bearings and left the cemetery from different spots.
</p><br><p>Bernadette’s gaze froze as she watched this. Her brows raised slightly as she finally understood why the creatures on this island had struggled to come to this area before dying and why they had to die here:
</p><br><p>Here, death—an endpoint—didn’t mean entering the state of eternal slumber, but rather a new beginning!
</p><br><p>Furthermore, this wasn’t the “resurrection” of a zombie or skeleton that a Spirit Guide was capable of. It was a “new life” with a certain will and vitality.
</p><br><p>A distortion and disorder of the world’s underlying rules? In addition, it seems to contain some mystery from the Black Emperor’s resurrection... However, those who obtained new life aren’t in a proper state. They’re even closer to zombies... Such revivals are very problematic... Klein, who was above the gray fog, also saw this scene and had many guesses.
</p><br><p>Of course, this was under the premise that the Emperor had fundamentally left his last mausoleum here and exerted some form of influence here.
</p><br><p>As he thought about it, Klein rejected this idea.
</p><br><p>This was because, before the Emperor became an angel, this primitive island had a similar situation. The dead Grimm was proof!
</p><br><p>Yes, the exact details that happened back then might not be the same as what’s happening now. Perhaps, compared to the past, it has already been distorted and “disordered”... Klein nodded gently, prepared to bless and protect Bernadette at any time.
</p><br><p>Bernadette also came up with a guess. She didn’t allow the Invisible Servant to stay in its spot to wait for a “new tide of life.”
</p><br><p>This was because she had foreseen a development:
</p><br><p>After being repeatedly affected by the “new tide of life,” the Invisible Servant would oddly develop some sort of sentience and come “alive”!
</p><br><p>In addition, it wasn’t that the Invisible Servant hadn’t done any investigation prior to this, but it had ultimately failed to discover anything special about the black stone pillar. Bernadette didn’t believe that it would gain anything new by remaining here.
</p><br><p>In such a situation, it was better to establish a basic understanding of the primitive island rather than alarming an unknown existence due to a deeper study.
</p><br><p>Many a time, there were problems that eluded one in the beginning, but the answer might be nearer to the end.
</p><br><p>This was thanks to the experience that Bernadette had accumulated over all these years.
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"></div><br><p>The corpses on the trees and branches gradually grew fewer as the Invisible Servant moved forward. During this process, Bernadette discovered another phenomenon:
</p><br><p>In the “new tide of life,” it wasn’t certain that a corpse would be revived. However, once they revived and left the empty area, the rest of the corpses would be attracted like metal to magnets in the next five minutes. They would stiffly move towards the center, filling up the corresponding spots like they were in line for a bestowment.
</p><br><p>The law of Beyonder characteristics convergence? No, it doesn’t seem like it. The deceased have already passed down their characteristics... As Bernadette’s thoughts wandered, she suddenly thought of a question:
</p><br><p>It’s impossible for the deceased to produce new Beyonder characteristics after obtaining new life, but do they still possess their powers in their previous lives?
</p><br><p>Once I have a complete grasp of the situation on this island, I can find a “resurrected” being to test it out... Bernadette quickly made a decision and followed the Invisible Servant’s route forward.
</p><br><p>She didn’t use any Beyonder powers other than her Invisibility Hat. She hoped that she wouldn’t disturb the environment and miss out on any details. Therefore, she didn’t walk too fast. She took about fifteen minutes to leave the cemetery.
</p><br><p>The Invisible Servant had already entered the forest up ahead. It could hear the occasional bird chirping and beast roars. The vibrant vitality here was different from the other remaining regions.
</p><br><p>Above the gray fog, Klein sighed.
</p><br><p>Thankfully, I’m now the owner of Sefirah Castle. Here, I have the status of a King of Angels. I can observe reality for as long as I want to, and I don’t have to worry about draining my spirituality. Yes, the only thing I need to pay attention to is my body that’s hidden in the ancient city located in the fog of history before the First Epoch.
</p><br><p>After traveling for another few minutes, the Invisible Servant suddenly saw something that appeared incongruous to the primitive island’s environment.
</p><br><p>It was a log cabin that seemed to be a residence of a forest ranger.
</p><br><p>The log cabin was brown in color and was less than 2.5 meters tall. It looked like it was prepared for humans, but every detail was rough and crude.
</p><br><p>At that moment, the cabin’s door was open, allowing Bernadette to see the situation inside through the Eyes of Mystery Prying.
</p><br><p>A wooden table, a fur-covered bed, and a low-back chair formed a scene of a residence lived by humans.
</p><br><p>Who lives here? With a thought from Bernadette, the Invisible Servant rapidly approached the cabin in search for possible clues.
</p><br><p>It then realized that the interior of the cabin was ice-cold. Apart from the furniture, there was nothing else. It seemed like no one had lived there for a very long time.
</p><br><p>Just as Bernadette was using the Eyes of Mystery Prying to carefully inspect every detail in the cabin, she suddenly had a premonition. She hurriedly made the Invisible Servant turn around.
</p><br><p>At some point in time, a person had appeared behind the Invisible Servant!
</p><br><p>He was wearing luxurious clothes from the Roselle era. His hair was completely white, and he looked old. He had a pair of light blue eyes that were extremely cold and blank.
</p><br><p>Edwards.
</p><br><p>This was the knight who had outlived the Emperor, Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina’s ancestor.
</p><br><p>Edwards stared at the Invisible Servant for a few seconds. Suddenly, he opened his mouth and said in a low voice, our Highness.”</p>
