</p><br><p>With regards to the other secrets hidden in Calderón City, as well as the loitering figures around the River of Eternal Darkness, he temporarily didn’t have any thoughts of starting a deeper exploration of it. This was because he still had more important matters to prepare for. He also had a key question to ask the Evernight Goddess.
</p><br><p>Soon, he held the ritual and allowed the candlelight and spirituality materials to fuse together, forming a Door of Sacrifice and Bestowment.
</p><br><p>Without any hesitation, Klein placed the bird-shaped, golden accessory into the wind, allowing it to slowly pass through the mysterious door and vanish into the endless darkness.
</p><br><p>In the next second, he sharply noticed that he had been dragged into a dream.
</p><br><p>In the center of the dreamscape was a gothic palace that seemed to blend with the darkness around it. Its details were exquisite, its color dim, but it was still gorgeous.
</p><br><p>Klein passed through bushes of night vanilla and slumber flowers before stepping into the palace.
</p><br><p>In the deepest part of the hall, the Evernight Goddess was sitting on an ancient high-back chair. “She” was still wearing the layered black dress that didn’t seem complicated.
</p><br><p>The sparkling spots on the dress reflected the dome and the walls, and the pillars of the palace created a quiet and dreamy starry sky.
</p><br><p>The Evernight Goddess, whose face seemed to be covered in layers of fishnet veils, held the bird-shaped, golden accessory and slowly stood up. “She” walked down the stairs to Klein.
</p><br><p>“Her” voice sounded, sounding like a lullaby:

</p><br><p>Klein politely took off his top hat and bowed slightly.
</p><br><p>“I want to know if the grayish-white fog that envelops the River of Eternal Darkness has something to do with that Lord of the Mysteries.”
</p><br><p>That was also the Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings.
</p><br><p>Although he couldn’t see the Evernight Goddess’s face clearly, Klein felt like “She” was smiling when he looked straight at “Her.”
</p><br><p>“Yes. Furthermore, not only is the River of Eternal Darkness enveloped by the grayish-white fog, but the city behind Bansy Harbor, and the entire Western Continent is enveloped by the same grayish-white fog.”
</p><br><p>Klein hesitated for a moment before saying, “This is a kind of seal?”
</p><br><p>The Evernight Goddess’s dream projection nodded.
</p><br><p>“That’s right. Apart from Sefirah Castle and the Chaos Sea, all the other sefirot were sealed in the Western Continent by that mysterious Lord of the Mysteries.
</p><br><p>River of Eternal Darkness, Brood Hive, City of Calamity, Tenebrous World, Nation of Disorder, Knowledge Moor, and Key of Light have all been sealed in the Western Continent by the Celestial Worthy? Isn’t this too much? What pomp... It’s no wonder that the city behind Bansy Harbor’s door is like the former Shanghai... This is the City of Calamity affecting that city in the real world, as well as Bansy. Then, to a certain extent, it has caused certain changes? Klein was enlightened and amazed.
</p><br><p>Back when he saw the scene behind the door in Bansy, he had suspected that it had something to do with the Western Continent. Furthermore, according to the clue that Bansy was the headquarters of Red Angel Medici’s family, he suspected that behind the door was the reflection of the sefirah, the City of Calamity.
</p><br><p>After a moment of silence, Klein didn’t conceal his feelings. He sighed and said, “The power of that Lord of the Mysteries far exceeds my imagination...
</p><br><p>“How could such a Great Old One, who is known as one the pillars of the universe, silently perish?”
</p><br><p>The Evernight Goddess’s dream projection shook “Her” head.

</p><br><p>“From the clues that were available, ‘He’ died together with the God Almighty of ancient times.
</p><br><p>“That God Almighty’s corpse formed the first Blasphemy Slate in the Chaos Sea. And beside it was the Uniqueness of the Marauder pathway.”
</p><br><p>In other words, in the middle of the First Epoch, the Lord of the Mysteries and God Almighty had a battle that was abnormally intense but didn’t cause much of a stir. In the end, both perished? This can explain why the ancient sun god had the Uniqueness or a Grazed Uniqueness of the Marauder pathway when “He” walked out of the Chaos Sea. It was ripped off by the ancient God Almighty from the Lord of the Mysteries... Amidst his thoughts, Klein asked in puzzlement, “Why would ‘They’ want to kill each other? ‘They’ are both pillars and aren’t from similar pathways. There shouldn’t be any life-and-death conflicts that cannot be resolved.”
</p><br><p>The Evernight Goddess’s dream projection said gently, “Convergence is an instinct.
</p><br><p>“The higher the level, the stronger the instinct.
</p><br><p>“That Lord of the Mysteries and God Almighty of ancient times were unable to restrain themselves from converging together, becoming the embodiment of the entire Universe, which is also the innate instinct of the original Creator.”
</p><br><p>The crazier one becomes the stronger they become? And beyond cunning, powerful, terrifying, and filled with wisdom, there’s such a side to the Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings? Klein thought for a moment and said, “That Lord of the Mysteries and God Almighty of ancient times, are, in essence, different sides of the original Creator?”
</p><br><p>The Evernight Goddess’s dream projection said in a comforting voice, “Using the same existence but different personas as an analogy will be more accurate.
</p><br><p>“The original Creator was the maker of the Universe, and also its destroyer. It is both day and also night. It’s the light of holiness, and also the decadent abyss. It is an amalgamation of all contradicting concepts and symbolism.
</p><br><p>“That’s why ‘He’ naturally has a tendency to be dissociative in a way that cannot be controlled. Once ‘He’ splits, there will be a strong trend towards convergence.
</p><br><p>“In a time more ancient than the era we lived in our past lives, the original sleeping Creator had naturally split into multiple personas. They were also in a state of slumber, but they began to use the authority and Beyonder characteristics they controlled to influence the world, making many preparations for the true dissociation when the original Creator awakened.
</p><br><p>“Here, the most powerful and active ones were God Almighty and the Lord of the Mysteries. The latter had another honorific name in the Western Continent.
</p><br><p>“In the early-mid stages of the First Epoch, ‘They’ should’ve used different methods to grasp the additional sefirot. This made ‘Their’ inclination to converge more intense, making it impossible for them to control themselves, and began taking actions against each other.

If a Great Old One exceeds this limit, just accommodating an additional sefirah will lead to being controlled by the convergence instinct in an irreversible manner.
</p><br><p>“No one knows the exact situation of the battle. Even the Seven Lights of the spirit world do not know. We only know that, from that fateful moment onwards, the two Great Old Ones known as the ‘Pillars’ vanished completely. As for the other sefirot other than the Chaos Sea and Sefirah Castle, they were sealed by Sefirah Castle’s powers in the Western Continent. That was once the territory ruled by the Lord of the Mysteries.
</p><br><p>“This setup led to a problem. It was that, before the reappearance of the Lord of the Mysteries and God Almighty, and before removal and breaking of the Western Continent’s seal, no Sequence 0 in this world could become a Great Old One to resist the Outer Deities.
</p><br><p>“As the apocalypse approaches, this problem will force all the true deities to nurture a Lord of the Mysteries or God Almighty. And the former Lord of the Mysteries and God Almighty are very likely to awaken in ‘Their’ bodies.”
</p><br><p>This... Therefore, the sealing of the other sefirots was done deliberately by the Celestial Worthy, preventing the later Sequence 0 true deities from deliberately avoiding this pathway, killing the chances of the birth of a new Lord of the Mysteries? And as long as a new Lord of the Mysteries is born, “He” has a high chance of being revived and completely awakening... Isn’t this too sinister? From a certain point of view, there’s no need to be afraid of others knowing this arrangement. The more entities that know of it, the more they will be inclined to quickly support the growth of a Lord of the Mysteries, so as to prevent them from only having a few years towards the end to gain control of their corresponding sefirot... The more Klein thought about it, the more terrifying the Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings appeared.
</p><br><p>This made him sigh inwardly.
</p><br><p>As expected of a pillar that can make the Genie fall into such a predicament to this day...
</p><br><p>Klein immediately asked, “Then why didn’t you support the growth of a Lord of the Mysteries in the Fourth Epoch?”
</p><br><p>He actually knew the answer to this question. As time passed, as the original Creator’s different personas, the Celestial Worthy and God Almighty will have “Their” wills constantly weaken. The closer they got to the apocalypse, the weaker the corresponding will became. This made those of the future be able to resist and suppress “Them,” and avoid losing “Themselves.”
</p><br><p>This could be proven by the fact that Adam had waited until recently to advance to Visionary.
</p><br><p>The Evernight Goddess’s dream projection revealed a smile.
</p><br><p>“Back then, Amon and Bethel were unwilling. All of them wished to make all sorts of preparations, hoping to make the attempt when the apocalypse was approaching.
</p><br><p>“As for Salinger, ‘He’ planned to use the River of Eternal Darkness to fuse with the Red Priest’s Uniqueness to create a brand new Great Old One path. Then, ‘He’ went mad. ‘He’ wasn’t able to resist the desire for converging the Twilight and Evernight pathway.”
</p><br><p>Death was also forced into such circumstances. On the one hand, the apocalypse was only a thousand years or so away, and on the other hand, the River of Eternal Darkness had been sealed by the Celestial Worthy, a pillar. This prevented “Him” from attempting to control it... It’s too sinister, too much! Klein couldn’t help but inwardly criticize the Celestial Worthy.
</p><br><p>At this moment, the Evernight Goddess’s dream projection continued, “The seal on the Western Continent is gradually weakening with time. The sefirot will instinctively or consciously use their symbolism to corrode the Uniqueness and High-Sequence Beyonder characteristics that land on them to influence the outside world.
</p><br><p>“The first to seep out energy was the River of Eternal Darkness. In the Second Epoch, it formed a distributary through Gregrace. After that, in the Fourth Epoch, traces of more sefirot began to appear on the Northern and Southern Continents and the islands over the Five Seas.
</p><br><p>“This is an important factor hidden behind many of the anomalies in the Fourth Epoch.”
</p><br><p>The sefirot had indirectly exacted their influence through the seal in the Fourth Epoch... It’s no wonder Adam said that my understanding of the Fourth Epoch’s history isn’t deep enough... From the looks of it, Bansy Harbor retained the elven customs not because it was an elven settlement, but also because of other factors... Klein thought for a few seconds before smiling.
</p><br><p>“I roughly understand.
</p><br><p>“Is that why you’ve been helping me all this while?”</p>
