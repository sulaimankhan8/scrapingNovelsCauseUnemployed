</p><br><p>Based on what he knew, Undying died once every sixty years before reviving. They would then lose most of their memories, which needed to be slowly recollected. It was like the beginning of a new life.
</p><br><p>This was knowledge that came from the potion, so Patrick Bryan easily understood what the Blessed meant. He deliberated over his words and said, “I’m not 50 yet. I haven’t been an Undying for more than 10 years.”
</p><br><p>Klein then asked, “When did you switch faiths to our Lord?”
</p><br><p>Here, “Lord” referred to the Lord of the Underworld.
</p><br><p>Bryan recalled for two to three seconds before he said, “I had just celebrated my 30th birthday back then.”
</p><br><p>Stepping into the world of mystery at 30 and becoming a Beyonder. Becoming a Sequence 4 demigod before 40... This speed either means shocking talent or that he’s a Blessed... Heh, indeed, his spirit and body had been influenced by the Death pathway’s Uniqueness during that ritual... As Klein listened, he became more certain of his theories from before.
</p><br><p>Of course, compared to how he had only taken a year to go from an ordinary person to a Sequence 4 demigod, Patrick Bryan’s advancement speed was nothing
</p><br><p>On this point, Klein didn’t feel that there was anything to be poignant about, because he was truly a “Blessed.” Furthermore, he had cheats-far greater than one.
</p><br><p>The only problem was that he wasn’t sure if everything that he had done was enough to exchange for something
</p><br><p>After some thought, Klein asked, “What’s your current public identity?”
</p><br><p>“I’m a businessman. I have two garment factories in Backlund. On the surface, I believe in the Evernight Goddess and am a supporter of the New Party...” Patrick Bryan introduced himself.
</p><br><p>Klein nearly let out a scoff as he continued, “How many Numinous Episcopate members do you have under you? What are they doing?”
</p><br><p>Already prepared, Bryan answered eloquently, “Two teams, a total of twelve Beyonders. Some of them are working at my garment factory while others are in the watch and clock industry. All of them have their own formal occupations.
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"></div><br><p>“Typically, they will be careful when proselytizing to the people around them. The progress on this is very slow, nor is it the main goal. We do not have more than a hundred believers.
</p><br><p>“Most of the time, they are searching for clues that God had left behind, as well as the different materials needed for the awakening ritual.
</p><br><p>“With clues in hand, we will carry out operations. And once the materials are gathered, we will experiment in different awakening rituals and seek out the most effective one. I’m the main person behind this operation, and am also core to the rituals.”
</p><br><p>You sound pretty proud of that... Klein asked about other matters and received detailed answers.
</p><br><p>Finally, he thought for a moment before saying with a stern expression, “In accordance with the revelation from God, you are to heed my instructions from this moment forth.”
</p><br><p>Patrick Bryan immediately got up and gave a solemn bow.
</p><br><p>“Yes, Your Excellency.”
</p><br><p>Klein nodded slightly and answered, “First, stop all rituals and stop gathering materials. God has already partially awakened. ‘He’ is in ‘His’ recovery stage, so ‘He’ isn’t to be disturbed by ‘noise.””
</p><br><p>From Klein’s point of view, regardless of the changes in Bryan’s awakening rituals, they were ultimately pointed at Artificial Death-the Death pathway’s Uniqueness. This would only increase its chances of coming to life, making it disadvantageous for the Goddess to deepen her control over it.
</p><br><p>And regardless if Klein was happy for this to happen or not, since the Evernight Goddess had assigned Bryan to him, he had to make such arrangements.
</p><br><p>Patrick Bryan had zero doubts toward his explanation, because Death had indeed awoken, and “awakening rituals” were, in essence, a form of “disturbance.”
</p><br><p>This Undying thought before asking, “Your Excellency, what should we do next?”
</p><br><p>Klein smiled with approbation.
</p><br><p>“Continue seeking out clues for things that God left behind. This will aid in ‘His’ recovery.”
</p><br><p>Upon saying that, Klein originally had a second request, but he was worried that there were too few clues to it, making it possible for the Numinous Episcopate members to stir up trouble with nothing to be done. He added, “In addition, promote reading to all those around you and your subordinates, be it at the garment factory or elsewhere. Establish night schools or learning classes. Let the people around you extricate themselves from ignorance and savagery.”
</p><br><p>To make it more convincing, Klein stretched out his right hand and pressed it to his chest. With abnormal piousness, he began preaching, “God said one needs to understand the belief to believe.
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"></div><br><p>“God said that to those who are lost, one has to first strengthen their body and arm his brain. This is because the kingdom ‘He’ promises is one without ignorance and savagery.”
</p><br><p>Patrick Bryan didn’t doubt Dwayne Dantès’s words, nor did he find it strange that such records weren’t found in the Numinous Episcopate’s bible. This was because this person before him was God’s Blessed, a representative appointed by God!
</p><br><p>He earnestly nodded.
</p><br><p>“I will heed God’s teachings.
</p><br><p>“May every spirit gain eternal life in God’s kingdom!”
</p><br><p>As he said that, he used the praying gesture that the Numinous Episcopate’s Artificial Death faction used. It was to raise both hands high, thumbs facing each other as he held them at his forehead.
</p><br><p>In mysticism theory, this was the core to the Underworld contained in every Gatekeeper. It represented Death’s position.
</p><br><p>Klein returned with the same gesture and words before saying, “Second, orders from the Southern Continent-no matter who it comes from—has to be handed to me first. They can be done only after I give permission. If no permission is given, you are not to do it in private. You can only give feedback based on what I say.”
</p><br><p>This was because he was worried that Haiter, the angel of the Death domain, would still remain fervent about the Artificial Death plan, occasionally instructing Bryan and the others to make new attempts.
</p><br><p>Meanwhile, he also had to ensure that Haiter and the other two saints wouldn’t notice anything amiss before the Goddess gained a deeper control over the Death pathway’s Uniqueness. He needed to prevent them from doing anything excessive.
</p><br><p>Bryan had no objections on this matter.
</p><br><p>“Yes, Your Excellency!”
</p><br><p>After giving instructions on the two most important matters, Klein wore the same expression, but he inwardly felt relieved. He said after some deliberation, “Third, unless convened by me, do not seek me out. Our usual communications shall be completed via messengers.
</p><br><p>“As you know, there are many existences in the astral world who do not wish to see God return.”
</p><br><p>Patrick Bryan nodded heavily.
</p><br><p>“I understand.
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"></div><br><p>“My messenger’s summoning incantation is ‘Spirit wandering above the world, absolutely friendly creature, Patrick Bryan’s Contract Companion.” Indeed, it’s impossible for a demigod of the Death pathway to not have a messenger... Normally, Sequence 6 Beyonders of this pathway should have one... Klein didn’t hesitate as he answered in an unhurried tone, “Remember, my messenger’s summoning incantation is ‘The spirit that wanders about the unfounded, the friendly creature that can be subordinated, the messenger that belongs to Gehrman Sparrow.’ Oh, be it receiving or sending mail, a gold coin needs to be paid to complete the transaction.”
</p><br><p>Klein deliberately revealed that Gehrman Sparrow and Dwayne Dantès were related, in order to determine Bryan’s reaction.
</p><br><p>“Gehrman Sparrow...” Patrick Bryan repeated the name in puzzlement before coming to an enlightened state. He exclaimed in pleasant surprise, “Your Excellency, Death Consul?”
</p><br><p>Thankfully, although he’s a byproduct of a ritual and is fervently zealous, he has normal intelligence. He can consciously seek out information and do an analysis... Klein exhaled in relief and replied with a smile, “I’m not him. ‘He’ is my teacher.”
</p><br><p>Bryan nodded in thought, believing that he had fully understood the entire matter.
</p><br><p>Klein guessed at his thoughts but ignored it. Crossing his right leg, he placed both hands on his knee and asked, “What do you know about the other factions of the Numinous Episcopate?”
</p><br><p>Patrick Bryan sat down again and said, “The Numinous Episcopate’s strongest faction is the royal family faction. With God’s descendants as the core, they have established many organizations...
</p><br><p>“Their leader is currently a descendant with a relatively thin bloodline. Her name is Sia Palenque Eggers. She might be an angel or wields an important relic of God. She calls herself Pale-White Empress...
</p><br><p>“Other than her, the royal family faction had five other saint apostles. Some of them are true demigods, while others rely on Sealed Artifacts...
</p><br><p>“Other than the royal family faction and us, the other factions are relatively weaker. The main ones are the Repose faction and the Underworld faction... Only by working together do they have three powerful Beyonders who are equivalent to the saint apostles...”
</p><br><p>After Bryan finished, Klein nodded indiscernibly.
</p><br><p>“That’s it for today. If there’s anything in the future, feel free to contact me.”
</p><br><p>“Yes, Your Excellency.” Patrick Bryan stood up and bowed before leaving the room. The door silently opened as the “figure” outside slinked into the shadows and disappeared with the cold wind.
</p><br><p>After everything calmed down, Klein glanced at the door that had closed. He walked to the window, drew the curtains, and looked towards the street.
</p><br><p>There were a few carriages there at some point in time. Each of them had two lanterns hanging in front of them. Their lights were abnormally pale-white with a tinge of dark green. They illuminated the surroundings into a blur.
</p><br><p>Nearly transparent figures surrounded this blurry scene. They were wearing illusory clothes that appeared like formal wear, making them appear rather formal.
</p><br><p>After Patrick Bryan landed from midair and returned, the figures bowed and attentively followed the demigod and the spirit beside him onto the hardly-visible carriages. Then, they steered into the distance.
</p><br><p>The pale-white light with tinges of dark green grew faint and finally vanished into the darkness as though it had never arrived.
</p><br><p>Klein looked away and muttered to himself with a solemn expression, Although the revelation received by Patrick Bryan stems from the Goddess and “Her” considerations, I have a nagging feeling that there’s something dark and sinister about to break out in Backlund or even the entire world.
</p><br><p>I wonder when it will stir up some waves...
</p><br><p>With this in mind, Klein didn’t delay a second. He immediately contacted Demoness Trissy to confirm that nothing abnormal had happened to her.</p>
