</p><br><p>The one that was most interested Cuarón’s suicide was none other than Justice Audrey. However, she had long noticed that Fors had some slight interest in the case. Hence, she didn’t ask and had maintained her posture, patiently waiting for a particular best-selling author to pose the question.
</p><br><p>In just a second or two, Fors looked at the borders of the table in front of The World and asked after some deliberation, “What’s the truth?”
</p><br><p>Klein had already rehearsed how he was to describe it, so without any hesitation, he got The World to say, “The mastermind behind it is the royal family’s consultant, Hvin Rambis. He probably has another identity—a councillor of the Psychology Alchemists.”
</p><br><p>When she heard the first sentence, Audrey’s mind had already naturally produced the image of a genial elder. This man came from an aristocratic background. He had graduated from Berth University and possessed profound knowledge and outstanding insight. He had been a consultant to the royal family for more than a decade and was publicly recognized as a scholar, a good man, a gentleman.
</p><br><p>Audrey had previously suspected that Cuarón’s suicide might have been instigated by the royal family, but she never expected the mastermind to be the genial, amiable, kind, and humorous Hvin Rambis!
</p><br><p>When The World announced the other identity of the man, she found herself unable to hide her alarm and puzzlement.
</p><br><p><i>Hvin Rambis is a Beyonder? He’s a councillor of the Psychology Alchemists?</i> </p><br><p><i>This also means that he might be a demigod... I’ve seen him so many times, but I’ve never connected him to the mysterious world. I always found him to be solely a scholar, a knowledgeable scholar...</i></p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"></div><br><p></p><br><p><i>If Mr. World wasn’t misled in his investigations, I’d really find it unbelievable. That Hvin Rambis, who’s known to be helpful to others, would treat a life with such coldness. He coldly made a child lose his father, a wife to lose her husband, parents to lose their son... He usually presents himself to be cultured and loving... Hmm, politics is dirtier than I imagined. Same for the royal family...</i> </p><br><p><i>Speaking of which, I have yet to meet a councilor of the Psychology Alchemists. I’ve never made contact with their upper echelons. I never expected that this secret organization is almost no different from the cults like the Aurora Order and Numinous Episcopate... Our Tarot Club is better. Mr. Fool is always stopping or disrupting the plans of the evil gods and devils...</i> </p><br><p>While Audrey’s mind was in chaos, Alger acutely sensed the brewing problems in Backlund’s political climate. He felt that various factions were interlinked and that there were many secrets. They formed a massive bucket of explosives that could explode at any time.
</p><br><p><i>The nobles, royal family, Church of Storms, Church of Evernight, Church of Steam, the burgeoning rich, the commoners who live on a precipice, and the lowest class who live abject lives... The revolution of the times is so obvious. To think I didn’t recognize this at all. I just simply believed Qilangos’s words and the “evidence” he showed. An epoch where the old gods fade and new gods arise is about to descend. The tides of history are roaring in an unstoppable manner... </i>Alger silently sighed, seemingly seeing the tall gothic bell tower and the Bell of Order that hung in it.
</p><br><p>And surrounding this famous landmark, swirls of air was materializing and the light was darkening. It appeared that eddies were gearing up to form hurricanes.
</p><br><p>Suddenly, Alger had a theory.
</p><br><p><i>What arises might not be a new god, but an ancient god from an even more remote age...</i> </p><br><p>He instinctively glanced at the seat of honor at the end of the long bronze table before quickly retracting his gaze. He could hardly quell the upheavals in his heart.
</p><br><p>At that moment, he had a baffling feeling that his ambition and goals were too puny. He had only wanted to become an archbishop of the Church of Storms, a saint. In this position, he would have authority in the world and he could direct many things in secret.
</p><br><p><i>Since the old gods are fading away and new gods are rising, Mr. Fool will be returning to “His” throne in the astral world. Then why shouldn’t I consider being an angel?</i> </p><br><p><i>Only at this level can I complete a qualitative change in my existence. I’ll be able to live a long lifespan. Only then can I lord over people and lead a large-scale organization. I’ll wield authority over the world!</i></p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"></div><br><p></p><br><p>As thoughts flashed through his mind, Alger trembled in an almost indiscernible manner. His heart was spewing with agitated emotions.
</p><br><p>When Cattleya connected Queen Mystic’s whereabouts for the past two months, she felt that the latter had been spending a large portion of her time in Backlund.
</p><br><p><i>Is something about to happen in Backlund? I can try asking when I write this time. I wonder what response Her Majesty will give... </i>Cattleya nudged her heavy glasses on her nose and swept her gaze across Miss Justice and the other members from Backlund.
</p><br><p>Fors knew some of the details of Cuarón’s suicide case. She knew that the victim had acted on his own the entire time and that he wasn’t controlled. She also knew that the witnesses believed without a doubt that everything was a result of Dwayne Dantès. Comparing this with the actual situation had induced a deep sense of fear towards the councillor of the Psychology Alchemists. She didn’t wish that she would one day find out that her thoughts and hobbies were all a result of someone else’s doing.
</p><br><p><i>How is this different from being a puppet? A High-Sequence Beyonder of the Spectator pathway is terrifying... However, this is really good writing material. Currently, the science of psychology already has hypnosis... In my next book, I want to write about a sick girl liking a gentleman. She uses hypnosis to make him fall in love with her. The ending climax is when she discovers that the gentleman is actually a master hypnotist... </i>Fors gaped her mouth before closing it again. She didn’t ask further about Hvin Rambis since she didn’t know him at all.
</p><br><p>Klein’s sharing of Hvin Rambis was mainly to warn Miss Justice. He wanted her to be careful and wary of this Psychology Alchemists councilor. Now, seeing that his goal had been achieved, he said, “There’s another matter. Help me take note of Brigadier General Qonas Kilgor. He’s the deputy director of MI9. On the surface, he’s only a Sequence 5, but in actual fact, he’s a Black Emperor pathway demigod. He possesses rather potent spiritual perception and can sharply detect that others are observing him.”
</p><br><p><i>Qonas Kilgor... </i>Audrey repeated this name inwardly and realized that she had no impression of this gentleman.
</p><br><p><i>Either we have little overlap in our social circles, to the point of just nodding at each other when bumping into one another without asking who the other is, or he keeps an extremely low profile. He doesn’t attend such gatherings often... If I have a chance, I should ask Kance. He’s from MI9. He definitely knows this superior of his... </i>Audrey was no longer surprised that Qonas was a demigod despite being a Sequence 5 in name. From her point of view, it was common for members of an intelligence agency to be in such situations.
</p><br><p>Alger and Cattleya had more or less heard of the high-ranking member of MI9, Qonas Kilgor. However, they lacked a deeper understanding of the matter, so all they could do was refresh whatever they knew and remind themselves to be especially careful when encountering anything to do with the person in question.
</p><br><p>Seeing that Mr. World had nothing else to share, Derrick didn’t wait for Mr. Hanged Man to ask. He said, “I’ve made a new friend again.”
</p><br><p>He paused for a moment before getting to the crux of the matter.
</p><br><p>“The area he patrols includes the former Chief’s mausoleum. He told me that the six-member council has yet to open the door that leads underground. However, through the cracks on the outer rocks of the mausoleum, there are luxuriant and strange plants growing out from them. They look like human hair.”
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"></div><br><p><i>The six-member council has three demigods. Even if there are some out on expeditions and aren’t in the City of Silver, the other three likely control a certain powerful Sealed Artifact or have Grazed an evil spirit, giving them nearly demigod strength. Despite joining forces for so many days, they haven’t managed to open the entrance to the former Chief’s mausoleum... This means that it’s quite a serious problem... Also, what’s the reason for plants that resemble human hair to suddenly grow? </i>One question after another arose in Klein’s mind as he waited for The Hanged Man to ask Little Sun.
</p><br><p>He knew that the former would definitely have questions.
</p><br><p>Alger, who finished listening quietly, frowned slightly before relaxing his brows. After some deliberation, he said, “Apart from that, are there any anomalies?
</p><br><p>“Is the one in charge of opening the mausoleum that Shepherd Elder Lovia?”
</p><br><p>“It’s not her. The Chief is present too. Likewise for two other Elders,” Derrick answered seriously. “There aren’t any other anomalies for the time being.”
</p><br><p>Alger nodded and said, “Very good. Maintain your present state. Establish communications with more people. Keep a note of any changes with that mausoleum.”
</p><br><p>After being praised, Derrick hurriedly nodded as he answered eagerly.
</p><br><p>After a few more exchanges of words, the gathering naturally began the learning segment. Fors had planned on asking what the Pharaoh mummy was for, but after seeing The World, she shut her mouth.
</p><br><p>When the gathering ended, Klein, who had returned to the real world, turned on the tap and washed his face and hands before patiently waiting for night to come.
</p><br><p>When the time came, he would be riding on a military airship to Desi Bay.
</p><br><p>...
</p><br><p>Southern Continent, Behrens Harbor.
</p><br><p>As the Golden Dream was cruising south in the Fog Sea, Danitz only took a few days to arrive at the harbor northmost of West Balam.
</p><br><p>He draped himself with a dark-colored cloak and carried a suitcase. Wearing the Sun Brooch inside his clothes, he carried an iron-black boxing glove close to his chest. He was walking down the harbor’s roads and was out while sweating profusely. He felt that he was already armed to the teeth, far stronger than he was before.
</p><br><p>Once out the harbor, Danitz glanced to his sides and extended his hand to stop a carriage.
</p><br><p>When the carriage driver saw him, he said out a string of words:
</p><br><p>“%#@&amp;&amp;&amp;()(())...”
</p><br><p><i>What is he saying... </i>Danitz looked blankly at him. It took him a few seconds to recall one thing.
</p><br><p>He didn’t know the local language, Dutanese, at all!
</p><br><p>And back when he came to West Balam, he had his captain, a polyglot, leading the crew. He didn’t need to worry that he didn’t understand anything.</p>
