</p><br><p>Then, he beckoned for a ceramic jar wrapped in layers of paper figurines.
</p><br><p>This was the Beyonder blood from different pathways that he had previously gathered. It had been placed above the gray fog and sealed with the Paper Angel in order to slowly integrate it into this mysterious space’s aura, removing the connection between the blood and the individual. This was to prevent any accidents from happening to the provider when the door of the symbols was opened.
</p><br><p>To him, it was fine if he suffered backlash. After all, there was at least one more chance of him reviving. If it would affect those who trusted him and gave their blood, he would rather not do it.
</p><br><p>After peeling off the paper figurines at the mouth of the jar and pouring the two tubes of blood into it, he conjured a glass stick and reached in to stir it.
</p><br><p>Right on the heels of that, he used Paper Angel and sealed it again.
</p><br><p>I’m just short of Prisoner, Devil, and Demoness... After I complete the ritual, I’ll personally pay Miss Sharron a visit. It’s better to make a request in person regarding such matters. It’s too rude to do it by writing letters... Only Miss Magician is a little special. Clearly, she would prefer it if I wrote a letter rather than meet Gehrman Sparrow in person. Heh, she actually used the excuse that the ink had frozen due to the low temperatures to delay her writing. Heh, are her magic tricks just for show? Thankfully, my potion has already digested, so there’s no need for me to push her anymore... Klein mumbled inwardly as he threw the ceramic jar covered in paper figurine back into the junk pile.
</p><br><p>After leaving the world above the gray fog, he didn’t immediately prepare to advance to Scholar of Yore. Instead, he took out a pen and paper and drew the symbol that was a mixture of concealment and mystery prying.
</p><br><p>This was something he had planned to do before he consumed the potion—to ask Arrodes about Sefirah Castle.
</p><br><p>As the symbol took form, the light in the originally badly-lit room became darker, as if clouds were drifting past, blocking out the sun.
</p><br><p>After more than ten seconds, the full-body mirror with cracks suddenly rippled with aqueous light and silver words quickly appeared:
</p><br><p>“Exalted Great Master, your devoted, loyal and humble servant, Arrodes, is here to answer your summoning.

</p><br><p>This question... I seem to be able to read the panic and anxiety of this magic mirror... Does it feel a sense of danger? After some thought, he nodded in amusement.
</p><br><p>“Yes.”
</p><br><p>Actually, that has never been the case... I’m just comforting you... After answering, he silently added in his heart.
</p><br><p>The surface of the mirror lit up and the silver words were dyed golden.
</p><br><p>They squirmed and formed a new sentence:
</p><br><p>“Great Master, do you have any questions for me?”
</p><br><p>“Yes.” Klein secretly tensed up. “What do you know about Sefirah Castle?”
</p><br><p>Arrodes fell silent for a few seconds before the pale golden words changed:
</p><br><p>“I don’t know much about this. I’ve only heard some rumors. In the early days of the Second Epoch, the ancient gods believed that the original Creator left some things behind. That might be a ‘kingdom’ formed from a certain part of ‘His’ body or something created by ‘Him.’ And Sefirah Castle is one of them.
</p><br><p>“This was the name that the King of Demonic Wolves, Flegrea, gave. ‘He’ calls the Hounds of Fulgrim as Sefirah Castle Keepers. However, ‘He’ failed to enter Sefirah Castle even to ‘His’ death. Therefore, many powerful creatures suspect that Sefirah Castle doesn’t actually exist, but is just an abstract concept.”
</p><br><p>It had something to do with the original Creator? After pondering for a while, he said, “One of them... How many other entities like Sefirah Castle are there?”
</p><br><p>“Eight. There are detailed records on the second Blasphemy Slate. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen it.” On the surface of the mirror, lines of words appeared one after another. However, the pale gold color faded away, becoming silver once again. “The ancient gods suspect that the source of the underground corruption comes from a place similar to Sefirah Castle. They call it the Chaos Sea. Also, there are rumors that deep in the spirit world city, Calderón City, there are clues to the River of Eternal Darkness. This comes from the ancient god, Phoenix Ancestor Gregrace. As for the others, I’ve heard of some names, but it’s not a complete list. There’s Tenebrous World, Knowledge Moor, as well as the Brood Hive that’s related to the moon.”
</p><br><p>There are a total of eight. Chaos Sea, River of Eternal Darkness, Knowledge Moor, Tenebrous World, and Brood Hive... Brood Hive is related to the moon; it sounds very dangerous... I wonder if it has anything to do with the Mother Tree of Desire... Klein silently repeated the key information in Arrodes’s response. He had a nagging feeling that he should be able to grasp something, but he didn’t gain much from it. He even lacked the ability to piece together the clues.

</p><br><p>“That’s not important. What’s important is that I’m your loyal, lowly, and obedient servant.” Arrodes said the entire sentence at once.
</p><br><p>Obedient, this use of words... Klein silently lampooned before asking, “What are the origins of Dark Angel Sasrir?”
</p><br><p>On the surface of the mirror, silver words formed one after another:
</p><br><p>“I similarly can’t see it, but at that time, there was a myth that said that, when the ancient sun god was born, ‘He’ was light and darkness combined. After all, ‘He’ calls himself the Creator, so ‘He’ must be well-rounded and not lacking anything.
</p><br><p>“Later, ‘He’ separated the darkness in his body and used it to create the first angel with one of his ribs, Dark Angel Sasrir.”
</p><br><p>This... rib... I can totally imagine it. Back then, it was the ancient sun god who personally fabricated and spread this myth... Amon’s brother, your wife has become the Dark Angel! Klein was first alarmed before many strange ideas arose in his mind.
</p><br><p>As his thoughts settled, he began to analyze the truth behind this myth.
</p><br><p>With such a myth spreading, it will cause the believers to believe that Dark Angel Sasrir is the dark side of the ancient sun god. They would worship “Him” in the same way as the Lord. No one objected or forbade this myth. As for Dark Angel, “He” was ultimately the deputy of the divine kingdom, god’s left hand. So this implies that this was very likely true...
</p><br><p>What happened afterward can be summarized as the dark side of the ancient sun god colluding with foreign enemies, bewitching the Kings of Angels and assassinating the main body?
</p><br><p>This can explain why Ouroboros and Medici joined Rose Redemption. “They” were only following the orders of the “Lord”...
</p><br><p>From this angle, isn’t the position of Dark Angel Sasrir, in the ancient sun god’s divine kingdom, equivalent to The World of the Tarot Club? Hmm...
</p><br><p>Thankfully, The World is a fake person. He doesn’t have his own spirituality and thoughts...
</p><br><p>As he thought about it, he suddenly felt drenched with sweat. He was glad that he was a Seer and not some other pathway.

</p><br><p>Perhaps it has something to do with the fall of the ancient sun god...
</p><br><p>Therefore, the brother of Amon, the Dragon of Wisdom, and the True Creator wish to confirm the state of Dark Angel Sasrir...
</p><br><p>However, there are many other problems... In the twenty-two Beyonder pathways, which pathway is this King of Angels, the left hand of God?
</p><br><p>The Marauder has Amon, Apprentice has Mr. Door, Spectator, Reader, Bard, Sailor, Secrets Suppliant, Warrior, Sleepless, Planter, Savant, Monster, Hunter, and Arbiter are obviously impossible... Corpse Collector is also impossible due to the existence of Death in the Fourth Epoch. It’s impossible for there to be a King of Angels to exist at the same time—unless the Dark Angel had already fallen to Sequence 2... By the same logic, the Seer and Lawyer pathways can be eliminated for now. It can then be confirmed that the Dark Angel is no longer a King of Angels...
</p><br><p>Mystery Pryer, Moon, and Devil are all certain possibilities. I cannot eliminate the possibility that the Hidden Sage, Primordial Moon, and the Dark Side of the Universe are the Dark Angel’s “alt”... Yes, there might still be the Mother Tree of Desire hidden within...
</p><br><p>It’s also possible with Prisoner. There’s no clear evidence that this pathway has produced a true deity. Back then, the Chained God might not even be a King of Angels.
</p><br><p>After some thought, he said to Arrodes, “It’s your turn to ask.”
</p><br><p>On the cracked full-body mirror’s surface, silver words twisted together and formed a new sentence:
</p><br><p>“Great Master, may I guess what you want to ask next?”
</p><br><p>“...” Klein nodded slightly and answered, “Sure.”
</p><br><p>“You wish to ask about Sasrir’s current state. My answer is, I don’t know, as I can’t see.” Behind the silver words was a smiley face with a simple drawing.
</p><br><p>“Not bad,” Klein praised. “That’s all for today. I will summon you again in the near future at any time.”
</p><br><p>“Yes, Great Master. Your loyal servant, Arrodes, is constantly preparing to serve you!” On the surface of the mirror, the simple smile on his face turned into a waving cat’s paw.
</p><br><p>When the mirror returned to normal, Klein took out a pen and paper and wrote down what he had just learned.
</p><br><p>This was one of the documents he had prepared for the Scholar of Yore ritual.
</p><br><p>In the past few days, he had written a lot of documents on ancient history.
</p><br><p>Following that, with the information and two marionettes, he “Teleported” to the Southern Continent.
</p><br><p>He didn’t dare to advance in Backlund. If anything were to happen to him, Amon and Zaratul would definitely be able to detect it and come straight for him!</p>
