</p><br><p>Suddenly, Klein’s mind tore apart, turning into countless small pieces that combined with different Worms of Spirit. There was no longer any discernible difference between the main body and the auxiliary ones, nor was there any piece that remained dominant.
</p><br><p>At some point in time, he had entered the grayish-white fog. His half top hat and long black trench coat quickly disintegrated, and numerous translucent and twisted maggots crawled out.
</p><br><p>These maggots quickly flew into the depths of the fog of history, each occupying different “light fragments,” overlapping with the projections of themselves in the Historical Void.
</p><br><p>In just two or three seconds, the spot where Klein stood only had his windbreaker, shirt, top hat, socks, leather shoes, and personal items remaining. They had lost the support of a body and were held, suspended there.
</p><br><p>“I...”
</p><br><p>“Who am I...”
</p><br><p>“Who’s me...”
</p><br><p>“I’m the main body...”
</p><br><p>...
</p><br><p>The various Worms of Spirit had different but similar thoughts. None of them were willing to return to their “body” on their own accord. Instead, they felt a strong sense of animosity towards their own kind. It was only because they still had Klein’s remnant psyche influence that they hadn’t done anything extreme for the time being.
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"></div><br><p>At this moment, yet another invisible ripple appeared within the grayish-white fog.
</p><br><p>This ripple didn’t appear by coincidence. It had long existed in the fog, but compared to his collective whole, it appeared indiscernible. However, to a Worm of Spirit, it was obvious enough.
</p><br><p>It came from a portion of history that appeared in the present era. It symbolized the fragments of light from the end of the Second Epoch and portions of the Third Epoch. They symbolized the two thousand years that the City of Silver had persisted in the darkness.
</p><br><p>This forgotten history had a certain clash with the present era. As it formed a corresponding Historical Void, ripples spread out in an indescribable manner.
</p><br><p>Such ripples seemed to exert a strong attraction on the Worms of Spirit, making them peek their heads out from the historical scenes.
</p><br><p>After a short period of time, one of the Worms of Spirit crawled out of the light spot from which it occupied, having failed to resist it any further, and also succumbing to the effects of Klein’s remnant consciousness. It flew towards the center of the ripples.
</p><br><p>Right on the heels of that, Worms of Spirit returned from different spots in the fog of history, and they arrived at the fragments of light formed by the City of Silver’s history in the present era.
</p><br><p>When they reached a certain distance from each other, a strong force of convergence finally appeared, pulling together countless Worms of Spirit into one.
</p><br><p>This wasn’t an effect that could be produced by two or three Worms of Spirit. It needed to have a sufficient number for this phenomenon to happen.
</p><br><p>And when that portion of the Worms of Spirit was once again whole, Klein’s incomplete consciousness completed the piecing together of his identity. Things finally turned simple.
</p><br><p>The Worms of Spirit formed a transparent and gigantic vortex, emitting a strong convergence force that sucked over the remaining, hesitant, nearby Worms of Spirit that were unwilling to return.
</p><br><p>After more than two-thirds the Worms of Spirit returned, a series of transparent tentacles grew out of the vortex.
</p><br><p>They extended towards the Second Epoch, the First Epoch, and even the prehistoric city of an earlier time. They grabbed the last batch of Worms of Spirit, one after another, and stuffed them back into the vortex.
</p><br><p>In less than twenty seconds, the vortex began to extend, turning into a terrifying figure formed from transparent, twisted maggots. An invisible tentacle naturally extended from the figure’s body.
</p><br><p>The tentacles pulled over the windbreaker, top hat, socks, and leather shoes that floated in the fog of history, dressing up the terrifying figure.
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"></div><br><p>The figure formed from countless Worms of Spirit pressed down on the top of his head, causing the translucent feeling on his body to quickly fade, forming a layer of flesh-colored skin. Short black hair and brown eyes grew out.
</p><br><p>This was the appearance of Klein Moretti, but his height had reached 1.8 meters.
</p><br><p>With great difficulty, he finally regained consciousness. Before Klein, who had made his Soul Body whole again, could analyze his present state, he felt two abnormalities:
</p><br><p>One was from the Beyonder characteristic that fused with his body. It was a strong, terrifying, high, and mighty will that made it impossible to resist. It seemed to awaken a little as it transmitted one image after another. These images were filled with the mysterious knowledge of a Miracle Invoker. Some of them were dust that burned into suns, magnificent scenes generated by various celestial bodies. They were filled with a sense of desolateness, coldness, cruelty, madness, superciliousness, and void of any emotional imprints. They quickly assimilated into Klein’s spirit, changing his state in an irresistible manner.
</p><br><p>Another thing that surfaced before Klein’s eyes were the crimson stars and the numerous points of resplendent light. The prayers from the members of the Tarot Club emitted from those stars, including Justice, The Hanged Man, and The Moon. Most of the light points echoed with the prayers from the residents of Moon City. Together, they created an image that enveloped the grayish-white fog that looked at the world with pity. It was the image of an extremely high-level and secret existence.
</p><br><p>The two abnormalities reflected on Klein’s body, causing his left body to be covered in a grayish-white fog. A slight smile showed on his face that had deep-set eyes. His right body fractured once again, turning into a cluster of translucent squirming maggots and a bloodshot eye that was filled with madness.
</p><br><p>At that moment, the right side was constantly corroded to the left, and the grayish-white fog was gradually compressed to the extreme.
</p><br><p>Without any hesitation, he raised his left hand with some difficulty, and he summoned the white bone scepter with blue gems embedded at the top from the fog of history.
</p><br><p>Circling the Sea God Scepter were prayer points of light. With the help of this medium, they were transferred onto Klein’s body.
</p><br><p>Lightning bolts leaped out from the right side of his body as invisible winds and illusory waves swirled around him. This helped the grayish-white fog withstand the contamination from the left, allowing his entire body to come to a delicate balance.
</p><br><p>At this point, Klein recovered bits and pieces of his humanity and memories, making an initial recovery back to the state before he consumed the potion.
</p><br><p>He had finally advanced to the level of Sequence 2. He now had the level and status of an angel—a true Miracle Invoker.
</p><br><p>Originally, Sefirah Castle was about to be stirred by his change, but with a thought from him, all the abnormalities returned to normal.
</p><br><p>This proved that he had truly gained control of Sefirah Castle and had become the owner of the sefirah. As for how much power he could unleash in the real world, he was still unable to estimate it.
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"></div><br><p>Phew... Thankfully, I made the history represented by the City of Silver return to reality, and it’s powerful enough. If the ritual’s effects were a little weaker, I would’ve lost control and collapsed here today... Klein rubbed his temples and slowly exhaled. He had a better understanding of anchors.
</p><br><p>The anchor wasn’t a tool to help him maintain his humanity. Its main purpose was to form a corresponding understanding, positioning, and image, one that would resist the mental imprint within the Beyonder characteristic so as to maintain an intricate balance.
</p><br><p>Under this balance, Klein could then barely maintain his humanity and not be severely affected by any other influences.
</p><br><p>In other words, the deities that the believers knew were different from the actual deities. Without the mental imprint within the Beyonder characteristic to resist this influence, the image of the deities in their hearts would gradually envelop the true appearance of the deities.
</p><br><p>This was also a type of corruption.
</p><br><p>Only at this moment did Klein realize why the orthodox deities went from having humanoid statues to simply having Sacred Emblems. This prevented the believers from having a unified impression of “Them.” This improved the effects they had as anchors to resist the remnant mental effects of the Primordial One, whilst also not subtly changing their bodies.
</p><br><p>As for why the orthodox deities took one or two epochs to figure this out, Klein quickly thought of two reasons:
</p><br><p>Firstly, he had the past images of the orthodox deities for comparison. He had Emperor Roselle’s diary as reference, and the corresponding mysticism knowledge to provide inspiration. Secondly, the Mythical Creature form of a Seer was all about being split and separated. It made him very sensitive to such influences.
</p><br><p>This sort of balance isn’t too stable, and it often tilts to a certain extent. This will cause problems with my condition’s stability. From time to time, I will end up scaring the people around me. Fortunately, this can be predicted ahead of time, so it can effectively be avoided... Also, when I’m in a delicate balance, I should try my best to show my humanity to strengthen my self-awareness... This is commonly chosen by many angels. The Rose School of Thought’s indulgence can be considered to be doing the same...
</p><br><p>But Amon’s believers are all “Himself.” How does “He” maintain the balance?
</p><br><p>Could it be that the Mythical Creature that’s born with the Uniqueness itself has the will of the Primordial One fused with “Him”? Amon is long accustomed to being half-crazy. No, that’s not “His” normal state... It’s the image that arose from the referendum of every Amon...
</p><br><p>That’s a line of thought. I can form a marionette group and make every marionette a believer of The Fool. In addition, with my truest appearance as a deity, this can effectively provide the best anchor... It’s no wonder that Zaratul and the Dark Demonic Wolf don’t have any believers... Uh, once the residents of the City of Silver switch faiths to The Fool, I can consider separating the embodiment of Sea God from myself, making it no longer one of my anchors. This greatly contradicts the beliefs and understanding of my other believers. They can’t truly be united... Klein instantly thought of a lot of matters, and after his thoughts finished racing, he returned above the gray fog.
</p><br><p>When he became a Miracle Invoker and became a “Him,” as well as becoming the owner of Sefirah Castle, he no longer needed to take four steps counterclockwise, recite the incantations, or get all the members of the Tarot Club to pray. He could now easily return.
</p><br><p>However, he seemed incapable of expressing the full powers of Sefirah Castle. He could only enter with his Spirit Body, unable to bring his physical body along.
</p><br><p>After sitting in the seat belonging to The Fool, Klein wasn’t in a rush to check on the changes in Sefirah Castle. He first confirmed his advancement and digested the mysticism knowledge he had just obtained.
</p><br><p>Yes... The Beyonder powers of a Miracle Invoker come from two different aspects. One is the greater utilization of the fog of history, and the other is the newly enhanced core power of “Wishes.”
</p><br><p>The improved utilization of the fog of history includes several abilities:
</p><br><p>One, using the help of past Worms of Spirit to revive myself, but it will be ineffective after four times. I’ve already used it three times, so I can only revive one more time as a Miracle Invoker. Once I advance to an Attendant of Mysteries, there should be a corresponding increase in this number. Two, I am able to exert some influence on the future, causing the probability of certain things to increase or shrink to a certain extent. It’s equivalent to interfering with the fate of the target. Heh heh, I’m finally wielding good luck. However, this aspect is still different from the Die of Probability. Three, summoning from the Historical Void is no longer limited to just items. It can be extended to certain scenes I’m familiar with.
</p><br><p>Yes, the total number of items and scenes I can summon now is nine, but only three of them can be at the angel level...
</p><br><p>“Wishes” already make it a standard deity’s ability, but it’s a little strange. Only by fulfilling someone’s wish can I fulfill my own wish. A small wish has to be granted before a bigger wish can be gradually granted...</p>
