As he looked around, he realized that the servants were much more energetic than usual. They even felt a little agitated.
</p><br><p>Indeed, Life’s Cane also affects humans, but it’s not that ridiculous. It’s at a rather normal level and still within acceptable levels... According to this logic, the servants’ reproduction abilities would definitely increase. The only problem is that they don’t have spouses, so there’s no way to show that...
</p><br><p>Eh... Will Mr. Butler’s act of returning home today result in him having another child in nine to ten months... His wife is almost 40 years old. It’s a little dangerous for her to have children at this age. Of course, as the other party in the copulation process, the effects of Life’s Cane would pass over to them. There shouldn’t be any problems...
</p><br><p>Man, I wonder if the potential effect will result in an increase in conceiving a child. If Dwayne Dantès’s moving into Böklund Street causes one to have an increased chance of having children, my reputation will practically be doomed... Klein’s thoughts drifted without end. Finally, he concluded in his mind:
</p><br><p>Life’s Cane truly is very sinister!
</p><br><p>In the future, he would only bring it into the real world for some time each day and try his best not to affect the humans around him!
</p><br><p>After breakfast, Klein brought his valet, Enuni, to the first floor and prepared to take a stroll.
</p><br><p>At that moment, two chambermaids were cleaning in the main hall.
</p><br><p>“Good morning, sir.” Upon seeing Dwayne Dantès approach, the two chambermaids immediately stood up, made way for him, and greeted him.
</p><br><p>Of course, if they were in a more remote corner, they would try their best not to make a sound, just in case they disturbed their employer. This was something they learned from Butler Walter’s teachings.
</p><br><p>Klein nodded and gave a simple response as he slowly approached the door.
</p><br><p>At that moment, the two maids suddenly saw a wheat head embedded in Enuni’s head. It was full of golden particles and was extremely attractive.
</p><br><p>Before they could even take a closer look, the valet seemed to have sensed something amiss. He raised his right hand and yanked off the piece of wheat using plenty of force.
</p><br><p>The two maids looked at each other in surprise and amusement.

For example, under the pillow he slept last night. In his dreams, he pushed the pillow away and ended up lodging a piece of wheat into his hair without realizing it when washing up in the morning and during breakfast.
</p><br><p>Although this process was complicated and not easily achieved, it was still possible.
</p><br><p>It can’t be that Enuni grew a single wheat head, right... The two maids mumbled to themselves as they continued with their work.
</p><br><p>After exiting 160 Böklund Street, Klein and Enuni slowly walked with one behind the other under the withered Intis parasol trees, breathing in the fresh autumn air.
</p><br><p>Like him, a number of neighbors were taking a morning stroll.
</p><br><p>Of course, this wasn’t a habit belonging to those amongst Backlund’s high society. Last year, the smog was very serious, and the air was quite pungent. No one was willing to waste their time in the streets, braving the cold wind and the humidity.
</p><br><p>As a neighbor, since they had met each other, there was no doubt that they would greet each other. When they walked past each other, one of the lawyers glanced at Dwayne Dantès’s valet from the corner of his eye-he had raised his hand to cover his mouth as if he was yawning.
</p><br><p>When the mixed-blood youth put down his right hand, the lawyer suddenly realized something was different.
</p><br><p>His nose seems to be even higher...
</p><br><p>Haha, I must’ve been thinking too much about such matters, causing me to hallucinate...
</p><br><p>If only my nose was slightly higher...
</p><br><p>As the lawyer thought about it, he raised his hand and rubbed his nose. At the same time, he saw two wild dogs engaged in a chase in front of him, attempting to reproduce on the street.
</p><br><p>After the stroll, Klein returned to the activity room on the third floor and sent Life’s Cane above the gray fog.
</p><br><p>Indeed, there’s a certain effect. The main point of the Bizarro Sorcerer’s digestion is actually to create shocking scenes to scare people, as well as use a strange method to make people horrified... This really does resemble a “director,” but it’s just a horror flick’s director...
</p><br><p>Yes, I don’t have to really scare them... Peaceful daily life events contain terrifying scenes, but the surrounding humans don’t notice them at all. They only occasionally made the connection, and when they think about it, they would feel a sense of fear from certain possibilities, to the point of not daring to turn off the lights and ending up having nightmares. That’s also a horror film archetype... As Klein observed his condition, he summarized his experiences over the past few months and finally summed it all up with the keyword “horror film director.”
</p><br><p>After understanding this, he had many ideas on how to quickly digest the potion.

</p><br><p>This will be quite troublesome. I definitely have to give my all to the targets at the demigod level. I wouldn’t be in the mood to waste my time and effort on pulling some tricks... Well, there’s no need to find a demigod target. There’s no restriction for acting like this. I can “Teleport” to the sea, and find some lucky pirates to “participate,” creating some horror stories...
</p><br><p>That’s right. Since I’m a director, I have to let my “works” spread! It seems like I have to let some of the actors escape successfully every time and spread the nightmare that they experienced, creating a corresponding myth at sea. I can’t feed them to Creeping Hunger... As he formed his plan, Klein suddenly thought of a question:
</p><br><p>In the horrifying legends of the people in the Northern Continent and the sea, how many of them were deliberately created by Bizarro Sorcerers?
</p><br><p>There must be some... Sigh, if Amon were to act as a Bizarro Sorcerer, “He” would probably be able to digest the potion in less than a month. “His” talent in this aspect is astounding, and “He” doesn’t consider the consequences... In truth, while looking for pirates to “film the horror movie,” I can find an opportunity to scare other demigods. I don’t have to fight them to the death. Once my goal is accomplished, I can escape... With this thought in mind, Klein came up with a plan for the supporting role.
</p><br><p>Hence, he carefully considered his targets.
</p><br><p>There’s no way I can find an angel or higher. Those who I’m not familiar with will make me the leading character of a horror movie on the spot. Those who are familiar with me are well aware that I’m a Bizarro Sorcerer, so there’s no way to scare them...
</p><br><p>There are many saints that I have no idea about their whereabouts. Frightening the archbishops will easily cause unnecessary chain reactions, causing the world situation to become even more tense and for the war to erupt prematurely...
</p><br><p>Uh, after eliminating all the possibilities, the most suitable target is the Numinous Episcopate’s Artificial Death faction’s demigod, Patrick Bryan, as well as the councilors of Will Auceptin’s Fate Council, as well as...
</p><br><p>After creating a name list, Klein decided to take some time over the next two days to visit Dr. Aaron Ceres. He wanted to bring some ice-cream for a certain baby to ask where the “councilors” were recently seen.
</p><br><p>If he wanted to frighten someone else’s subordinates, he had to get the approval of the president!
</p><br><p>Klein was in a good mood after organizing his thoughts. He went out again and went to Saint Samuel Cathedral to pray and donate before heading to the Loen Charity Bursary Foundation where he stayed till noon.
</p><br><p>In the afternoon, he saw a few businessmen and professional lawyers and accountants who were seeking investments, behaving like a normal tycoon.
</p><br><p>After filling his stomach, he returned to the half-opened room with the balcony. Just as he was considering whether to visit Dr. Aaron Ceres’s house directly tomorrow, or invite their family to have a nice dinner at the Srenzo Restaurant which served excellent ice-cream, his spiritual perception was triggered.
</p><br><p>He turned his head and, without any surprise, saw Miss Messenger walk out of the void with four blonde, red-eyed heads.
</p><br><p>One of the heads bit on a letter.

</p><br><p>As he had yet to receive the letter, Reinette Tinekerr could only answer with three heads.
</p><br><p>“King...” “Of...” “Idiots...”
</p><br><p>Patrick Bryan? This nickname has even evolved? Klein reached out and took the letter. When he opened it, he realized that it was indeed from the Artificial Death faction’s demigod.
</p><br><p>He wrote on the letter:
</p><br><p>“...I’ve already prepared the special ritual that will help my teacher, Haiter, recover further. Your Excellency, I will hold it tomorrow at midnight given your permission...”
</p><br><p>The ritual that points towards the angel, Haiter? There’s no way to avoid the Numinous Episcopate’s Artificial Death faction’s testing of Patrick... This can be interfered with using Paper Angel... Just in time... With a flick of his wrist, Klein burned the letter.
</p><br><p>Following that, he took out a piece of paper and wrote down an answer:
</p><br><p>“Yes, you may. You must be careful.”
</p><br><p>In the quiet night, near midnight, in a uninhabited clothes factory in St. George Borough.
</p><br><p>There was an open area that had been cleared. Nearly ten black-robed figures were standing there.
</p><br><p>In the middle of them was a deep black coffin that looked rather heavy. Around the coffin were many golden ornaments with mud stains. There were many candles flickering with pale-white flames, as well as one skull after another.
</p><br><p>The hideous white skulls belonged to humans, others from animals. Some were extremely strange and had a deformed look to it. It was hard to imagine their original appearance.
</p><br><p>The skulls were piled the highest up at the front, with Patrick Bryan standing there.
</p><br><p>He had also changed into a black robe, but he didn’t pull up his hood, revealing a deep outline. He had black hair, brown eyes, and a rather long face.
</p><br><p>This demigod hadn’t done anything, but his surroundings had turned extremely cold, as though countless invisible creatures were celebrating
</p><br><p>As Patrick Bryan raised his right hand, the hooded believers jumped up and twitched a little. It was a crazy and rhythmic dance.
</p><br><p>This was a Spirit Dance, a ritual that Death loved. The stronger the spirituality of the dancers, the better the effects.
</p><br><p>As the dance became more intense, a cold and formless wind blew out from the coffin. Patrick Bryan lowered his head and recited in a language that seemed to come from the Underworld:
</p><br><p>“The King from the depths of Hell;
</p><br><p>“An Angel playing the music of death;
</p><br><p>“The Ruler above River Styx.”</p>
