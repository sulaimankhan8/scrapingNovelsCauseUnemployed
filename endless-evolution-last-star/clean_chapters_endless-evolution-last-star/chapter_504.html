            <br><p>"Deal!" Adam exclaimed happily when he heard that he had a chance to see Tron's Nexus.</p><br><p>For many reasons, this was something interesting and desirable to Adam. He had a few ideas of what it could be, given that Tron's primary weapon was his First Order, but he wanted something more than guesses.</p><br><p>'Fine, Adam pull yourself together, it won't be easy, but I'll have plenty of tries. After all, it's not Tron, it's his ability. I've been dodging Plague Reaper's attacks, so I should be able to handle a few blades too, right?' Adam pondered, staring intently at Tron.</p><br><p>Electric shocks ran through Adam's body like waves, showing just how fast and dangerous a creature he was now.</p><br><p>But... it hardly seemed to scare Tron who was on a whole other level.</p><br><p>"Well, I'm a serious person, so since our training is now part of the deal, I won't hold back." Tron nonchalantly said before stretching forward two hands at once.</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could realize anything, Tron waved his hands downward, his fingers tense and the entire dome trembling slightly.</p><br><br><p>Dahla blinked, the next thing she saw was dozens of thin white flashes heading towards Adam, piercing his silhouette from all sides like needles stuck into a doll.</p><br><br><p>A stream of blood gushed from Adam's mouth, crimson trickles pouring from the many wounds located all over his body.</p><br><p>Glass blades pierced his arms, legs, torso, and even his throat. The only thing the blades didn't aim at was Adam's head.</p><br><p>Adam couldn't even move his arms since the blades slashed his muscles and tendons, targeting specific points, temporarily he lost control of his limbs.</p><br><p>After half a second, Adam's legs went limp as he fell to his knees about to collapse to the ground, his eyes rapidly going blank.</p><br><br><p>A white palm with soft, delicate skin covered in golden energy broke through the glass barrier, shattering it into tiny fragments.</p><br><p>A few steps were enough for Dahla as a spirit of light to appear beside Adam, catching him before he even fell, starting to heal him immediately.</p><br><p>"Damn it! Tron, I know it's important not to be soft when practicing, but isn't this a bit much? You did that attack like you were fighting in Dead Lands, against a monster capable of killing you!" Dahla exclaimed, looking at Adam's dozens of deep wounds.</p><br><p>As an experienced Phantom and former medic and surgeon, she realized that such wounds were far more traumatic than simple cuts.</p><br><p>Tron turned around, walking calmly toward the spectator room. Even Dahla would need some time to get Adam back to normal.</p><br><p>"We made a deal. He wanted this for himself, so now it's his fate to be killed by my blades time after time. If he can survive one minute, I'll actually be impressed."</p><br><p>"Tsk! You can't be so hard on a kid!" Dahla snorted with an annoyed face.</p><br><p>She may be a harmful and sarcastic person, but she could hardly be called mean or ruthless. Enjoy new adventures from empire</p><br><p>Tron turned around slowly.</p><br><p>"Kid? Dahla, Adam isn't a kid anymore. He's killed and seen others kill, and I'm not just talking about monsters... I'm not judging, since all Phantoms are like that."</p><br><p>Dahla didn't answer anything, she only bit her lip continuing to treat Adam's wounds.</p><br><p>Then, when she looked at his face, she froze for a few seconds with her eyes wide open.</p><br><p>'What...? Why the fuck is he smiling?' Dahla inwardly muttered unable to take her gaze away from Adam's slight smile despite the fact his body was bleeding.</p><br><br><br><br><p>The two threads traveled in a strange trajectory shattering many glass blades in their path. Returning to their owner, the threads destroyed two blades aiming for the vulnerable neck before disappearing along with the rings.</p><br><br><p>Several dozen blades rained down on Adam like a veritable white hailstorm, leaving him no options to block such an attack.</p><br><p>But... as the electrical discharges traveled through his body, he turned into a flash and found himself near the edge of the dome.</p><br><br><p>Tron swung his arms, tensing his fingers, making new blades appear, flying straight at Adam who was pinned against the wall.</p><br><p>The situation seemed hopeless, but Adam was in this position several times, so he knew what he needed to do to keep the blades from piercing his body.</p><br><p>Adam put his right arm out in front of him keeping it straight, then pressed his left arm tightly on top of it, starting to move it downward, hard and aggressively.</p><br><p>This caused the threads on his gauntlets to quiver like the strings of a musical instrument, causing one of the two possible sound waves - the red one.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The red wave traveled through the glass blades causing them to actively tremble, then... the first blade cracked.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, all the blades exploded due to the intense pressure, turning into white crumbs that showered Adam like snow.</p><br><p>Adam's azure eyes immediately reflected a few more blades, but he was ready for it.</p><br><br><p>A few quick and precise swings of the long needle were enough to destroy the blades, turning them to dust.</p><br><p>"Tsk. Don't think I'll let you win so easily." Tron frowned before tensing his fingers harder.</p><br><p>This was his last attack as Adam destroyed and blocked the glass blades for fifty seconds now. Another ten seconds and Adam would win their bet.</p><br><p>Almost a hundred blades appeared from different parts of the dome aiming straight for Adam. He could no longer use the red sound wave, so... it seemed he had no way to defend himself against them.</p><br><p>'Damn, there's a lot of them out there.' Adam internally muttered, feeling goosebumps covering his entire body, 'But... over endless fights and defeats, I've realized the essence of the K2. Abilities are no longer a separate power, they can all work with each other. The only limitations, are experience, skill, and imagination!'</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam did something unexpected, something he realized only a few days ago.</p><br><p>Adam broke his needle into two pieces, clutching each one tightly.</p><br><p>Under his will and the strength of his grip, the two parts shattered into fragments, turning into energy. Then, two white streams headed towards the recesses in his gauntlets, filling his Nexus and hands with new power.</p><br><p>The first time he did this was in the fight against Damien, but then it was not his decision but his needle and abilities, but now he realized he could control it.</p><br><p>However, the energy-filled gauntlets could not protect Adam from a hundred glass blades. He had to somehow destroy them in one attack.</p><br><p>'Hah, I need something like a red sound wave, but it doesn't necessarily have to have a special effect. You only need enough power to destroy such fragile but deadly blades.'</p><br><p>A satisfied smirk appeared on Adam's face.</p><br><p>'Good thing I've lost many times already, otherwise I wouldn't come up with something like this!'</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes sparkled as purple energy streams traveled down his arms, filling his hands with the power of gravity.</p><br><br><p>Tron's eyes went wide, the realization of what Adam was about to do coming to him.</p><br><p>"Alright, it's now or never!" Adam uttered with an excited smile before slamming his fists into each other.</p><br><p>All the power of his muscles, gauntlets, the needle's energy, and gravity burst into a single point grasped between his fists.</p>
