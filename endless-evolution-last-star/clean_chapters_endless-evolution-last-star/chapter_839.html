            <br><p>A while back, on his return to the Citadel following the battle at the Fume Cathedral, Adam fought against the silhouette of the Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>The situations were vastly different, but there was one similarity - it wasn't the real Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>However, the Plague Reaper had the same power level as he should have, the limit of Purple Threat Level or the strongest opponent for K1-Phantoms.</p><br><p>Such an adversary was too weak for Adam. No matter what the Plague Reaper was capable of, the difference in levels was too great.</p><br><p>Adam was faster and stronger, one dash and a powerful punch were all he would need to win.</p><br><p>For this reason, there was surprise in Adam's eyes, but no interest. He realized that the previous scenario would not happen again - the Plague Reaper was not strong enough.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>One star after another flew into the Plague Reaper filling its dark silhouette with dim light from the bright stars.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyebrow went up. He could feel the Plague Reaper's aura growing. It continued like this until the twenty-first star, by this point the Plague Reaper's aura was equal to Adam's.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, a bright flame immediately lit up in Adam's empty eyes.</p><br><p>"Right... Back then, in that strange space, I couldn't defeat you. You were too strong for me to do anything against you in a one-on-one fight. But... I'm not what I used to be!"</p><br><p>Unlike Adam, the Plague Reaper wasn't in the mood to talk. Well, he couldn't talk, especially when it was only a shadow replica of Adam's mind.</p><br><p>That didn't stop the Plague Reaper from making the first move. He stepped forward, in a heartbeat finding himself in front of Adam.</p><br><p>Without difficulty, Adam blocked the Plague Reaper's foot coming at him like a whip.</p><br><p>The impact traveled down his arm, along his entire body, then the Plague Reaper turned around trying to reach Adam from the other side.</p><br><p>Yet, he achieved failure again.</p><br><p>Adam's corners of his mouth turned upward in a satisfied smile.</p><br><p>"Well, well... Even though our strengths are equal, it's not just my energy that's grown stronger since our last encounter. I as a fighter have become significantly better."</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, plunging his fist into the Plague Reaper's stomach. His punch threw the monster aside, a shudder ran through the darkness, his silhouette ready to explode, but at that moment the stars shone brightly.</p><br><p>The Plague Reaper or the Second Key....?</p><br><p>The situation began to change quickly, as fifteen more stars flew out of the Second Key, nearly doubling the Plague Reaper's power.</p><br><p>Adam took a step back, his torso tilted slightly towards the ground.</p><br><p>'Are the stars going to make him stronger to infinity? No, there must be a limit, but I don't know what it is. Well, either way, I have no choice but to fight until I can defeat him in any condition.'</p><br><p>Then, the Plague Reaper and Adam rushed forward, clashing in another skirmish of many.</p><br><br><p>One victory after another, they soon turned into defeats only to eventually become victories again.</p><br><p>As soon as Adam defeated the Plague Reaper, the Second Key would sacrifice its stars to make Adam lose the next time, yet it only had a brief effect.</p><br><p>Was Adam himself getting stronger? Did his mastery and body control increase? Maybe even his abilities changed?</p><br><p>Adam didn't know that, he didn't think about such details, because he had only one goal - to win.</p><br><p>In the end, Adam slowly sat down in the middle of the darkness, watching the bright glow before him.</p><br><p>The Plague Reaper, filled with the power of one hundred stars, collapsed to his knee. He tried to get up, but his wounds were far beyond saving.</p><br><p>With difficulty, the Plague Reaper raised his head to meet Adam's gaze, his cold eyes as calm as a pair of ancient ice aware of its greatness.</p><br><p>He hadn't noticed it, but during the battle against the Plague Reaper, his hair had grown longer, and while the tips hadn't reached his eyebrows before, now they were lower, as well as covering his ears.</p><br><br><p>With a thud, the Plague Reaper blasted away. Clots of darkness mixed with the stars rushed toward the Second Key, forming a long line without requiring Adam's intervention.</p><br><p>Startled, Adam looked up, watching as nearly half the stars became one.</p><br><p>"I see... So all these defeats and victories made sense. Hah..."</p><br><p>With a bitter smile, he shook his head.</p><br><p>"I don't know how long I fought him, but it wasn't bad. When the Plague Reaper absorbed eighty stars then I completely forgot about the Second Key."</p><br><p>After a few minutes, Adam stood up, stretched briefly, and looked at the Second Key, a hint of regret in his eyes.</p><br><p>"I don't know if I should call it that, but the break is over. It's time to get back to work, I've got over a hundred more stars waiting for me!"</p><br><p>His body jerked, but no sooner did he take a step than footsteps sounded again from outside:</p><br><br><p>With annoyance, Adam frowned.</p><br><p>"Tsk. Haven't I already defeated you? There's no point!" he waved his hand, "I'm sure a hundred stars is the most! You can't get any stronger!"</p><br><p>Then, Adam abruptly turned around about to meet the eyes of the Plague Reaper.</p><br><br><p>Whizzing through the darkness, in a scarlet flash, the trident thrust into Adam's chest, carrying him dozens of meters away.</p><br><p>Before Adam realized what happened, with a sweep of a hand, the trident was out of his flesh, returning to its owner.</p><br><p>Shocked to the core, Adam raised his head, his eyes wide.</p><br><p>In the distance stood the Crimson Monarch, a dark silhouette like his past opponent, but the Crimson Monarch was without his loyal ally - Moira.</p><br><p>"Kyros..." Adam gulped in disbelief.</p><br><p>Without waiting for Adam's action, the Crimson Monarch reached out for the Second Key - the free stars, one by one headed towards him.</p><br><p>Adam gulped, fear quickly filling his eyes.</p><br><p>"Fuck... Can I defeat you...? It's... It's not like I'm strong enough yet! I'm not K3-Phantom!"</p><br><p>However, this Crimson Monarch didn't know how to talk, he directly rushed into battle.</p>
