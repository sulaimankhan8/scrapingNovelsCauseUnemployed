            <br><br><p>Slowly stepping forward, keeping the tip of his spear pointed downwards, Fromund was heading towards Adam.</p><br><p>The only true solution for Adam was to clutch his needle tighter with both hands, waiting for his opponent to attack.</p><br><br><p>It was not a weapon Adam was used to fighting against.</p><br><p>'Well... I can't even remember if I've ever had a single opponent against me with a spear, especially one this big with a flaming effect. Damn, am I going to lose?'</p><br><p>Such thoughts were meant to cause panic and Adam was no exception, yet he was experienced enough to start analyzing his situation being realistic.</p><br><p>'All I have is my needle, quite possibly the last one I can summon, and a purple sound wave... It's unlikely to be useful against Fromund, at least not until I injure him badly.'</p><br><p>Then, Adam reached the same point in his thinking as Silvana had earlier.</p><br><p>'Yeah... All I have is another ghost trump card that I don't even know how to use. I wonder if Fromund has already done it? I hope so, otherwise, my situation is about to get worse than ever.'</p><br><br><p>As if able to read Adam's mind, Fromund let go of his spear, letting its tip sink halfway into the ground.</p><br><p>"I think our fight has a few minutes left, quite possibly much less, under one minute?"</p><br><p>The arrogant statement only made Adam wary, as he realized Fromund wasn't trying to trick or scare him - it was more like a friendly warning.</p><br><p>"Silent, right? Well, wise decision and it looks like you won't be able to repeat after me this time. I can see it in your lost look, Adam..."</p><br><p>At the same moment, Fromund put a palm to his chest. The red circle behind him disappeared, Fromund no longer wanted to waste energy on its maintenance, and the active streams of flame running down his arms, such fire was no longer useful to him.</p><br><p>"No meteorite, no flame breath, no stone peaks bursting out of the ground could stop you or hurt you. But, the melee is the moment when we inflicted major wounds on each other."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Fromund's aura intensified, his palm lighting up as a circular seal appeared on his chest with many intricate symbols inside.</p><br><p>It could easily be someone's emblem, a secret sign, or even a copy of a spell from some movie, but Fromund never cared about that since he knew what he had to go through to get a piece of that power.</p><br><p>"Heh, funny... I almost died then, but now thanks to a distant victory, I may find myself as the winner of another important fight."</p><br><p>A bitter smile appeared on Fromund's face as he activated his Power Gene.</p><br><p>A bright flash illuminated the arena, drawing all attention to himself, causing the eyes of the spectators to stare at Fromund like a hot sun, the star becoming for a moment the only important thing in their lives.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam was no exception.</p><br><p>His deep eyes gazed at Fromund with a kind of admiration and even awe, as if deep inside he felt that his opponent was worthy of it since he survived to gain such power.</p><br><br><p>In an instant, the light turned into a dense red flame, in many streams covering Fromund's entire body.</p><br><p>Despite its nature, this flame was not chaotic, it had a distinct form gradually taking on a definite - well-recognizable shape.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide when a barely audible whisper came out of her lips:</p><br><p>"Is this really the end... Such a thing... such a thing cannot be defeated with a single needle..."</p><br><p>A stream of hot steam came out at Fromund's sigh, sweeping forward to dissipate a second later, revealing his silhouette.</p><br><p>Flaming armor as red as the cruel sun covered his entire body. It was clear that the armor was composed of energy and fire rather than metal or other durable materials, but it was dense enough to look like real armor.</p><br><p>Sharp edges, dangerous peaks haunted every part of the massive, heavy armor, showing that only ready to fight a brutal battle and until the last drop of blood burned was worthy of carrying it.</p><br><p>The final piece of Fromund's armor was the flaming hoop sitting tightly on his head.</p><br><p>Like any armor, that one was designed to increase Fromund's defense, but not only that, it was only one of the many enhancements Fromund received.</p><br><p>The point of the armor was not just protection, but to ensure that the fighter could continue to fight even in the harshest of conditions for as long as was necessary for a crushing and much-desired victory.</p><br><br><p>Fromund pulled his spear from the ground, gripped the thick hilt tightly, and pointed his weapon at Adam.</p><br><p>"Hey, Adam, you've only recently become a K2-Phantom, haven't you?" Fromund asked with an excited smile on his face.</p><br><p>In response, Adam only narrowed his eyes and nodded uncertainly. He didn't see a problem with admitting it, but he sensed that bad news awaited him.</p><br><br><p>Fromund shook his head with a bitter smile.</p><br><p>"You know. I purposely stayed on W0-stage, and it resulted in me staying on K2W0 for a very long time. I clearly have an advantage over you, even though you're a decent fighter."</p><br><br><p>"Hah, are you interested or are you just stalling to regain some bits of energy?" Discover hidden content at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Without waiting for Adam's response, Fromund cast his gaze upward, meeting with Elva, Liv, and Tilda's concerned eyes, sensing how worried they were about him.</p><br><p>"I'm just scared. I realize I'm in for a challenge if I want to break the First Wall. And... for now, I'm not ready for that risk, if you understand what I mean."</p><br><br><p>Adam said nothing, though it was clear by the look in his eyes that Fromund's words had not passed over his ears.</p><br><p>Fromund scratched the back of his head awkwardly.</p><br><p>"Alright, something's gotten me talking. Adam, be prepared for defeat, I'll grant it to you soon enough!"</p><br><p>Then, feeling his superiority, Fromund stepped forward turning into a fiery flash, quick and somewhat... desperate?</p>
