            <br><p>"You shouldn't blame yourself." Tron said calmly with his eyes closed, sitting back in the chair, "You did more than was necessary. There were more opponents, but you not only survived, but you were also able to overpower everyone."</p><br><br><p>No one bothered to answer Tron.</p><br><p>Only after some time, Adam looked at him and said, "It's not about how we did... Humans shouldn't be our enemies, at all. We should be killing monsters, not each other."</p><br><br><p>"I used to think so too, once upon a time." Tron stretched out, "However if you want to move on, you'll have to accept that."</p><br><p>"Lower Ring... Do all the people there really want us dead...? Do they have a reason for that?" Katrin muttered with a blank stare.</p><br><p>Tron shook his head.</p><br><p>"This isn't about the Lower Ring, it's a shame you had to deal with it so early. Monsters are the enemies of our race, but there are Upper Ring or Lower Ring villains among us, it doesn't matter."</p><br><p>Tron sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"Sure. It's unlikely that any squad from the Upper Ring will attack you since it's monitored, but sometimes it happens. It all depends on the situation. What you must remember is that you must always fight like you did today. No matter who the enemy is, if he wants to kill you and hurt your mates, that's enough to consider him a monster."</p><br><p>Adam, Katrin, Mark, and Kody nodded slightly.</p><br><p>They knew that Tron was right because they had already decided it for themselves when the gunslinger killed Barna.</p><br><p>However, now they had to realize and accept - killing a human was not easy in a world where the only enemies of ordinary people - monsters.</p><br><br><p>Soon, the military helicopter returned to the Citadel, and the Travelers Squad completed their mission. Technically, it was a success, for they had lost two Phantoms, no Harvesters, and destroyed the Prime King, but... For Adam, Katrin, Kody, and Mark, it had been the blackest day.</p><br><p>For the next few days, none of them did anything, just a simple routine to help take their minds off things. Well... when they were alone with themselves, the thoughts just consumed their minds. It was as inevitable as what awaited them on day three...</p><br><p>Step. Step. Another Step.</p><br><p>Adam, in an all-black suit, walked forward with a deep gaze, along with Silvana, who was also dressed in all-black.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, they had to dress like that not because of the theme party, but because of one of the worst things that could happen in life - a funeral.</p><br><p>Katrin noticed Adam and approached him with a calm look.</p><br><p>"Hi... The weather's appropriate today, right?" Katrin muttered, looking up at the gray sky covered in overcast clouds.</p><br><br><p>"That's even better. I don't want the sun shining brightly at a time like this. Light is obviously not something that's going to help."</p><br><p>Then, Mark and Kody approached them. They said nothing and just watched as the military honored Barna and Sirgus before plunging their coffins deep underground.</p><br><p>The cries of their friends and loved ones did not end from the beginning until the last second. Everyone understood and accepted it, barely restraining themselves from getting emotional, as well.</p><br><p>In fact, the coffins were empty as the funeral was a formality to follow tradition. Barna and Sirgus had already been cremated, and their Nexuses dismantled for biomaterials. Their ashes were stored in a special building deep underground where thousands of cells of dead Phantoms rested.</p><br><p>It was cynical to some, but the government and military had to be practical. One way or another, there was simply no room for the graves of all the dead Phantoms.</p><br><p>It was necessary to just accept that and do the best that was possible under the conditions at the Citadel.</p><br><p>Sure, there would be enough place in the Dead Lands for every dead person in history.</p><br><p>But... Could it be done to those who were fighting for the survival of humanity? Moreover, too many Phantoms had already disappeared without a trace in Dead Lands. </p><br><br><p>Hours later, Adam and Silvana were the only ones left in the graveyard area. Adam wasn't hungry and didn't want to discuss what had happened like the others, because he had seen everything with his own eyes.</p><br><p>Soon, the rain started to fall, pouring cold drops down on Adam and Silvana.</p><br><p>"You can go now. You don't have to stand with me. I don't know how much longer I'll be immersed in my thoughts until it's enough for me." Adam said calmly, just staring at one point, into the void.</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head.</p><br><p>"You know I won't do that. I'll stay with you for as long as you decide. I'm not going to leave you at a time like this. Not now, not ever."</p><br><br><p>After a while, he asked:</p><br><p>"We screwed up, didn't we? I mean, with us killing the gunslinger. He was the last of their squad."</p><br><p>"You want to find out who they are and find them, don't you?" Silvana asked, she had been waiting a long time for Adam to ask her that.</p><br><p>"Sure. I think it's almost time to head to the Lower Ring. It's given me one more reason to do so."</p><br><br><p>"I've already tried to find information on Ruby Dew, however... My searches have resulted in rather meager outcomes. All I could find out was that it's a medium-sized organization in the Lower Ring and that they've been involved in controversial events many times before, but no details."</p><br><p>Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>"Damn. I know it would be wrong to let a gunslinger live. However, now we're in trouble for it."</p><br><br><p>"Decisions have to have consequences, don't they?"</p><br><p>"Absolutely." Silvana nodded, then the corners of her lips lifted slightly, "However, that doesn't mean all is lost. The problem isn't the dead gunslinger, it's that I don't have access to that information."</p><br><p>Adam gave her a questioning look.</p><br><br><p>Silvana smiled slyly.</p><br><p>"It's simple. We need to go to someone who can find out about Ruby Dew. To do that, we need an Operator of a higher rank than me."</p><br><p>Operators like the Phantoms had their own ranks. They didn't have to take any tests or exams for that, because their rank was tied to the rank of their Phantom. However, the rank was only held if the Operator performed well on the more difficult missions.</p><br><p>A Phantom could give up its Operator and that would result in a lowering of the Operator's rank. It was rare, but it did happen.</p><br><p>"I take it you already have some sort of option, don't you?"</p><br><p>"Sure. We could ask for help from some K2 or K3-Phantom. However, in our case, we have a much better option. I'm talking about Damien and his Operator." Silvana explained.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"Normally, K1-Phantom would have a hard time getting help from Damien himself, but I'm sure he won't turn you down. That's the kind of person he is, he's willing to indulge his own interests." Silvana smiled confidently.</p><br><p>"Alright, but do it tomorrow. I have to visit someone tonight."</p><br>
