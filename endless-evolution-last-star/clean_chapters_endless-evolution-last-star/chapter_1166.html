            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1166: Just Like Him</strong></p><br><p>As Damien had said, it was not difficult for Adam to find a place where he could obtain the Twilight Crystal. It was not an easy task, but Silvana had already prepared several options for him.</p><br><p>After they moved to the K4 Level, she had more access to various information. She was used to this process, it happened every time Adam became stronger or learned new secrets from the Citadel.</p><br><p>The Gamma Division knew where the Twilight Crystals were located because it wasn’t really a big secret. The monsters that controlled the territories didn’t absorb the Twilight Crystal immediately after its appearance.</p><br><p>They waited until the Twilight Crystal accumulated a little more energy, covering the ground with its power.</p><br><p>Sure, this carried some risks, as other monsters or Phantoms could come and try to capture the Twilight Crystal, but the risk was justified and worth the reward.</p><br><p>In the end, the strong always got everything, and this worked not only for the Twilight Crystals. If a monster couldn’t protect the Twilight Crystal that appeared on its territory, it had no right to that land.</p><br><p>Most often, the Twilight Crystals appeared at the Dark Shore or the Tarnished Lands. Sure, the Dark Shore was a priority for the ancient energy of the First Star, but the Tarnished Lands were a worthy option as well.</p><br><p>However, Adam had another priority. Obtaining the Twilight Crystal was no different from a regular mission, where he would have to defeat a powerful monster. It wasn’t the most difficult trial lying in his way.</p><br><p>Now, he and Damien were at the top of one of the towers overlooking most of the First and Second Rings.</p><br><p>They didn’t come here for the luxurious view, but so that Adam could use the Connected String.</p><br><p>It was a method available to him from the moment he became a Phantom. However, except for one time when he needed to kill a monster to unlock the Lock, there was no need or point in using this ability.</p><br><p>Only now, when Adam had reached K4-Level, did he need to obtain the Connected Heart. Not only did the monsters have to be connected to him, but their power level had to be very close to his. Not too weak, but not too strong either.</p><br><p>Using the Connected String wasn’t too difficult, especially when you had a Phantom like Damien helping you, but Adam still needed to focus.</p><br><p>“Alright, let’s get started.” Damien clapped his hands as he looked toward the Tarnished Lands. “First, let’s try to find some monsters there. I think there should be someone suitable there.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly as he closed his eyes.</p><br><p>“I just need to tap into my energy and dive into its origin?”</p><br><p>“Yes. But the first time, you may be shocked by the amount of information. For a moment, you will be connected to every monster that has anything in common with your energy. However, not all of them are suitable for you. You must continue to use the Connected String to pave the way to those monsters that can become your enemies.” Damien waved his hand.</p><br><p>He had to do this as well once upon a time. He was one of the strongest Phantoms of all humanity now, but that wasn’t always the case. Like Adam, he had to build his own Path Construct to reach the Second Circle.</p><br><p>“I see… What a strange feeling. It’s like I’m looking for a target from my own kind… Although they’re monsters and I’m human.”</p><br><p>Damien chuckled. “As strange as it may sound, you’re not wrong. If the creatures in our world were divided into factions based on abilities and elements, you wouldn’t be here in the center of the Citadel, but among the monsters you’re about to kill.”</p><br><p>Mixed feelings, incomprehensible to Adam, filled his heart.</p><br><p>When he first met the Silver Weaver, he felt nothing but wild fear and terror as he fought for his life.</p><br><br><p>‘What would I do now if I saw the Silver Weaver?’ Adam thought, sinking into his inner space. ‘I doubt I would be afraid. On the contrary, I would want to know more about him, because his abilities still live in me.’</p><br><br><p>Slowly, Adam walked toward his Evolution Tree, preparing to touch the trunk of the great tree where all his energy remained.</p><br><p>[Go on, Adam… I’m sure, just like you, the monsters connected to you are waiting for a worthy battle…]</p><br><br><p>“What about you? Doesn’t that mean their energy is similar to yours?”</p><br><p>[So what? Do you think all fire monsters are the same…? Maybe every Phantom with wind powers is a sibling…? You’re overcomplicating things… If you want to learn more about these monsters, get back into battle!]</p><br><p>It was unclear what the Evolution Tree was trying to achieve with its fiery speech, but Adam silently touched the bark.</p><br><p>Streams of energy filled his body, but instead of controlling or absorbing it, Adam simply plunged his consciousness deeper. He wanted to see what was at the very beginning.</p><br><p>Damien didn’t give him detailed instructions like Silvana would have, but Adam understood how Damien worked. This wasn’t a test where precise answers were needed; he just had to feel it.</p><br><p>One minute passed, then two, then five, then half an hour.</p><br><p>When an hour had passed, doubt appeared in Damien’s eyes.</p><br><p>‘Hmm, maybe I’m asking too much of him? I told him it was easy, but it’s not at all. It’s one thing to follow the path to a single monster like it was at the K0-Level, but it’s quite another to create a path from hundreds or even thousands of variations.’</p><br><p>However, just as Damien was about to touch Adam’s shoulder, something stopped him.</p><br><p>A satisfied smile formed on Damien’s face as he took a step back.</p><br><p>‘Good. This guy is not only progressing quickly, but he’s also learning. Just what our Citadel needs!’</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam’s energy trembled as he opened his eyes. His blue eyes now shone brightly like two starry lanterns, seeing hundreds of winding lines leading him in different directions, but most of them led to the Tarnished Lands.</p><br><p>There were his monsters, just like him.</p>
