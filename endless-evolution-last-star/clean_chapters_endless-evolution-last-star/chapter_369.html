            <br><p>Last time, Plague Reaper had to defend herself from Katrin's blast with his coat, though it wasn't him that was the target, but the ink streams and jaw-flowers.</p><br><p>But, now the explosion was concentrated on Plague Reaper and Katrin used as much energy as she could.</p><br><p>"Hahahahahahaha! Good job! Now he's finished!" Magnus exclaimed with a devious grin looking at the hundreds of crimson blossoms.</p><br><p>No matter what attempts Plague Reaper made to get out of this cocoon of death, it was already too late.</p><br><p>Katrin's eyes reflected a bright flash as all the flowers glowed brightly, exploding at the same time.</p><br><p>The flames and temperature inside were powerful enough to burn even Scarlet Pyromancer if he was still alive.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper was physically strong, but he didn't have any defense abilities or intense regeneration.</p><br><p>His jaws from coat could stop a blade or sword, but not the wave of fire coming from a devastating explosion.</p><br><p>"You'll burn... Even if you don't die, all your skin will be burned off, you won't be able to keep fighting." Katrin muttered in a slightly nervous voice.</p><br><p>It had only been a few seconds after the explosion, that she realized that Plague Reaper couldn't defend himself, but she also had doubts. She tried to make herself believe in her own words.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, a black flash flew out of the flaming captivity, easily destroying all the burning roots in its path.</p><br><p>The tips of the long coat caught fire, red sparks flying off to the sides, wisps of smoke actively exiting, leaving a trail behind the tall silhouette.</p><br><p>"What...? How did he get out...?" Katrin's eyes went wide with disbelief looking at Plague Reaper, who was running in her direction.</p><br><p>But... she wasn't the only one surprised, Magnus and Refesa, despite their experience and extensive knowledge couldn't believe what they were seeing.</p><br><p>Their reactions were not because Plague Reaper was able to get out of the cage, but something else... from Plague Reaper's calm eyes, along his pale face, ran swollen veins.</p><br><p>"No... This shouldn't be... Purple Threat Level monster has entered this state...? Even if it's a Top-1... I can't remember the last time I read a report that described something like this." Refesa gulped, not believing Adam's and Katrin's failure.</p><br><p>Before their thoughts could develop or Katrin's instinct for self-preservation could kick in, Plague Reaper attacked.</p><br><br><p>A silhouette in black robes with sparking lightning bolts all over its body appeared in front of Katrin.</p><br><p>Adam's silver fangs tightly clenched Plague Reaper's black blade, which he managed at the last moment.</p><br><p>"Stop standing still! It doesn't matter what happens to him! We don't have much time! Let's kill him together, right now!" Adam exclaimed, starting to attack at full speed.</p><br><p>Now, Plague Reaper's arms didn't flinch with every one of Adam's attacks, but he wasn't any stronger than he was.</p><br><p>Katrin gulped and joined him.</p><br><p>Every now and then she would use her staff for close combat, and summon roots leaving shallow scratches on Plague Reaper's body.</p><br><p>Each time, he somehow dodged at the last moment, but... even scratches could become serious damage if there were too many of them.</p><br><p>"Great! Let's clamp him down!" Katrin said confidently, not thinking about wasting time or the fact that they might lose.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper just couldn't get out from under their pressure.</p><br><p>Adam nodded firmly grabbed his needle and delivered several piercing attacks, aiming for Plague Reaper's chest.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's pupils narrowed as he realized he wouldn't be able to block all the attacks. He turned his torso to the side, but as soon as he did so, roots appeared behind him.</p><br><p>Instinctively, Plague Reaper's body arched, trying to prevent the roots from piercing himself, but it was too late.</p><br><p>The sharp tips of the roots dug into his right shoulder, tearing off a massive chunk of flesh.</p><br><br><p>A surge of blood rushed outward along with a painful grunt.</p><br><br><p>Adam tried to take advantage of this and give Plague Reaper a final attack, but the monster reacted quickly.</p><br><p>However... ten seconds later, Plague Reaper's wounds had only gotten worse, and the endless hail of attacks from Adam and Katrin would lead him to defeat.</p><br><p>Then, Plague Reaper realized that he had to get rid of Adam at all costs, it was the sure way to victory.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper had already used all his trump cards, he had nothing left. He could only rely on his physical strength and his coat... right?</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper's hand let go of the bone handle as it came into motion.</p><br><p>Adam and Katrin thought that Plague Reaper was going to grab one of them, but they were wrong, that's not why he released his hand.</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Plague Reaper ripped out his right eye, the bright pain, and blood failed to cause any emotion on his face, it was his decision with a clear purpose behind it.</p><br><p>Before Adam or Katrin could realize anything, a jaw opened on Plague Reaper's shoulder and a moment later his own right eye disappeared.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide as a chill ran down his spine at the realization of what Plague Reaper had done, followed by the crimson energy coming out of his shoulder, quickly traveling down Plague Reaper's arm.</p><br><br><p>Simultaneously, Plague Reaper slammed his scythe against the ground in front of Katrin, causing a small explosion and waves of dust that threw her aside a few meters.</p><br><p>"NO!" Katrin exclaimed, realizing how powerful Plague Reaper's attack could be.</p><br><p>Adam was about to dodge, the electrical discharges becoming more active, but it was already too late. With every beat of his heart, Plague Reaper's fist covered in crimson energy was approaching, much faster than Adam could move.</p><br><p>'Wait... Am I about to have the same thing happen to Oskar and Nessa...?' Adam thought remembering the past two crimson attacks of his enemy.</p><br><p>His mind filled with fear, realizing that he couldn't survive such a thing, his body would break down or at worst there would be immediate death.</p><br><br><p>With the next rush of wind, Adam's aloof blue eyes reflected someone's silhouette.</p><br><p>He watched as the long pink hair swayed, realizing that the one who stood back all this time had finally decided to make her move.</p><br><br><p>Instead of Adam, Plague Reaper's fist slammed into Osana's stomach, bringing all of his power down on her.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the shockwave threw off the small rocks and dust lying on the ground around them, and as it did, Osana's flesh tore and a wide hole appeared in her belly, a wide lance could pass through it without touching her body.</p><br><p>Scraps of blood and flesh scattered to the side, a few scarlet drops falling on Adam's shocked face, while the pool of blood beneath Osana grew larger with each breath.</p><br><br><p>Osana turned around, looking at Adam with a faint look that was quickly losing the flame of life, blood was flowing from the corners of her mouth relentlessly, and death was already ready to take her from this world.</p><br><p>"Three wishes..." Osana muttered in a hoarse voice, "Remember... Now, you owe me three wishes..."</p><br><br><p>Osana placed her palm against Adam's chest as her eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>She finally decided to use her Second Order, her most powerful and dangerous ability, as to achieve a decent effect, Osana had to take a risk.</p><br><p>Then, pink energy flowed down her arm that quickly turned scarlet like her blood mixed with the pain she was now feeling in agony.</p><br><p>A silhouette of a flower with ninety-nine pink petals appeared on Adam's chest, the tips of the outermost petals were red.</p><br><br><p>With a weak last smile, Osana fell to the ground with a blank, lifeless stare.</p>
