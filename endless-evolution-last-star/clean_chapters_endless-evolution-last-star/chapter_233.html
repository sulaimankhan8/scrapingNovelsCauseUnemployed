            <br><p>K1-Phantoms didn't usually visit the regions intended for K0-Phantoms, and the same was true for K2, K3, and K4-Phantoms.</p><br><p>It just didn't make sense for them, except for a special mission where they were helping one squad. Adam participated once, and because of the dark Phantoms, it ended in tragedy.</p><br><p>Thus, Tron, who had recently become a K3-Phantom, would never visit Silat Village, Rusty Ruins, or any other location below his level. The monsters there were too weak, with few genes, simple artifacts, and no development.</p><br><p>Thus, it was unnatural for Alienated Rocks to have a K1-Phantom like Adam, but sometimes it could happen, but there definitely shouldn't be a commoner here!</p><br><p>The only commoners that were supposed to visit Dead Lands were Harvesters and Military, but only with Phantoms and squads, and only for the duration of missions.</p><br><p>Now, Adam had brought a common person to Alienated Rocks, unaccompanied and unprotected, without an Operator, because Silvana was here, not in her office and unsupervised by the mission department.</p><br><p>Also, instead of avoiding the monsters to keep Silvana safe, Adam threw a grenade right into their nest!</p><br><p>Silvana didn't know what to do, her eyes were fixed on the grenade that as she approached the nest shone brightly, unleashing its full power.</p><br><br><p>The flaming explosion destroyed part of the Stone Gatherers Nest, which was filled with dozens of monsters!</p><br><p>Soon, the furious roar of many monsters could be heard. They were as far as the Thunder Demon's roar level, but that was only in Adam's eyes.</p><br><br><p>Silvana immediately fell to the ground, tears streaming from her eyes and only one emotion on her face - terror. The tears were a natural reaction of her body, for her mind realized that the next thing that would follow this horrible roar was death.</p><br><br><p>The first to emerge from the Nest was a massive monster, with a long torso that grew wider at the shoulders and narrower at the bottom.</p><br><p>Dense stone armor covered the Stone Gatherer, tending to protect the monster from any attacks. It had massive forearms with three thick claws on each, perfect for digging, which is what Stone Gatherers usually did.</p><br><p>The hind legs were as thin as steel rods but extremely solid, and the feet were as wide as hammers.</p><br><p>Stone Gatherers had only one large eye and a powerful jaw with several blunt teeth. Unlike other monsters, their teeth were not designed to pierce flesh, but to grind bones!</p><br><p>Stone Gatherer quickly ran straight towards Silvana, and in a few seconds, the monster would reach its target and devour her. Stone Gatherer would do it without difficulty, after all, Silvana was an ordinary human.</p><br><br><p>Stone Gatherer roared furiously, opening its maw wide with sticky, viscous saliva barely separating from its teeth.</p><br><p>'No... No, this can't be...? Am I going to die now?' Silvana internally muttered, 'What am I even doing in Dead Lands...? How did I end up here?'</p><br><p>For a moment, Silvana completely forgot what had happened before. All she could think about now was the monster's jaw that was right in front of her eyes.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, the monster stopped, it just froze in place, unable to move a single muscle.</p><br><p>Silvana blinked, and now Adam appeared in front of her, whose left hand went effortlessly into the Stone Gatherer's chest, tearing the monster's organs apart.</p><br><p>Then, with a calm face, Adam tossed Stone Gatherer aside as if it were a thing that wasn't worth his attention.</p><br><p>It was a dissonance for Silvana, a stark contrast, for what she had frozen in fear was nothing to Adam.</p><br><p>'How big is the difference between us?' Silvana thought, staring at Adam's serene face.</p><br><p>Well, it wasn't what she should have been thinking, but it was a start, for Adam wasn't finished yet.</p><br><p>Soon, a multitude of Stone Gatherers surrounded Adam. From the death of their fellow, they realized that Adam was the main threat here and had to get rid of him first!</p><br><p>"Adam! Look out! There are too many of them!" Silvana instinctively exclaimed, not thinking about exactly how strong the monsters and Adam were. She was, as before, just worried about him.</p><br><p>"Hey, Silvana." Adam said coldly before glaring at her, "Didn't I tell you to be quiet?"</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, afraid to utter another word, but her anxiety went nowhere as her nails scraped against the cold stone. She didn't even notice the fear disappear, replaced by worry.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crack.</p><br><p>The Stone Gatherers gritted their teeth before glancing around and attacking at the same time.</p><br><p>Silvana's pupils narrowed, and her eyes fluttered when she saw the huge shadows bearing down on Adam, thrusting their claws forward.</p><br><br><p>There was a bright white flash, and the next thing Silvana saw was five silver claws tearing through the monsters' stone armor with ease, going through it like a sharpened sword through paper.</p><br><p>It couldn't be called a battle, for Adam had killed dozens of monsters in one motion, destroying them.</p><br><br><p>Chunks of flesh spattered in all directions, drops of blood flying near Silvana, some landing right on her face, trickling down.</p><br><p>Adam canceled his Order. The Nest was still intact, and there were Stone Gatherers inside that didn't dare come out, but Adam wasn't going to fight them. Today, he wasn't here to kill monsters.</p><br><br><p>Adam walked over to Silvana, looking down at her.</p><br><br><p>"What...? What exactly are you asking?" Silvana asked uncertainly.</p><br><p>Adam stepped even closer, so much so that his chest blocked out the moon that had just begun to rise.</p><br><p>"Just how useless you've been." Adam said menacingly, seeming completely serious.</p><br><p>Those words were enough to make Silvana's face go pale, and all of her trembled as if she were ready to break. For her to hear that she was useless was the worst.</p><br><p>"How can you worry about me when you're frozen in fear of monsters that can't even scratch me!" Adam waved his hand, with a visible grimace.</p><br><p>"I... I... I..." Silvana wanted to say something, trembling.</p><br><p>"Silence!" Adam shouted, then his eyes shone brightly, and electric shocks ran throughout his body. A lightning horn appeared, while electricity came out of the tips of his hair, and his aura became so powerful that Silvana forgot how to breathe.</p><br><p>"These monsters are nothing compared to the Thunder Demon I defeated! I killed him because I knew I could because I had to, and it's your job to support me!" Adam said confidently.</p><br><p>Then, he unnaturally gently, given the situation, took Silvana by the chin, forcing their gazes to meet.</p><br><p>Adam's calm azure eyes, contrasted with Silvana's green and worried ones, waiting for the words that could change everything.</p><br><p>"You're useless because you're in Dead Lands, and you've seen firsthand what it means to be a Phantom. What it means to see death and how hard it is to come out of those situations victorious, I'm much better at that than you are. However, luckily for both of us, you're not a Phantom."</p><br><br><p>"You're my Operator."</p><br><p>Those words were enough to make Silvana's shivers go away in an instant, and her heart filled with a pleasant warmth instead of fear.</p><br><p>"If I were in your position I would be useless as well. You know your position, and I know mine, but one thing is unacceptable.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Silvana was puzzled, her lips slightly ajar.</p><br><p>"Disbelief in me. I forbid you to ever doubt my powers in fighting monsters. Your job is to help and guide me, is that clear?" Adam's voice was still stern, but not at all cold, and even slightly gentle.</p><br><p>Silvana smiled as she nodded vigorously.</p><br><p>"Sure, let me help you, let me continue to be only your Operator."</p><br><p>"Good." Adam said calmly before taking off his jacket and carefully covering it up Silvana said, "Take it, it's cold in here."</p><br><p>Silvana blushed slightly, normally she cared for Adam, so for her, this was something unique though strange.</p><br><p>"You know, all of this happened because of your excessive worrying, so... You deserve to be punished." Adam said, looking at Silvana.</p><br><br><p>"Sure, I'm willing to do anything. I fully understand that what I did was more like the behavior of a kindergarten child than your Operator." Silvana said confidently, without a shadow of a doubt.</p><br><br><p>"Well, so now it's my turn to act like a child."</p><br><p>Then, Adam stooped down, fixing Silvana's curls.</p><br><p>"Your punishment will be a ban on hair styling, you'll be with your hair so disheveled for a month, cute and harmless."</p><br><p>Silvana's serious expression, which was still a moment ago, shattered like glass as she blushed even more.</p><br><p>"As... as you wish." Silvana whispered, turning away to the side.</p>
