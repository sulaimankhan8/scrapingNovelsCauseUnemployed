            <br><p>Second by second, Adam was approaching the very center of the Citadel. They passed under the First Ring, under the Wings but not into their territory, for the tunnel was underground.</p><br><p>They had only one way through, there were no turns or other levels, yet the road was wide enough for a tank or even a fighter jet to get through.</p><br><p>It allowed one car to accelerate to the limit speed, Seyrina wasn't going to slow down until they reached the end.</p><br><p>Silvana didn't say anything. Her interest was as strong as Adam's. She, like him, had many doubts about what might be at the center of the Citadel.</p><br><p>It was something important, a secret beyond the reach of ordinary people, still, she was sure that there was no place inside the First Ring for something like that.</p><br><p>After a few minutes, Seyrina's satisfied smile faded, replaced by a severe expression. She slowed down considerably, getting closer to the blue light at the end.</p><br><p>Only Douglas remained calm.</p><br><p>Despite being a K4-Phantom, Seyrina visited the Zero Ring far less often than Douglas.</p><br><p>A flash blinded them, causing them to squeeze shut.</p><br><p>The next moment when Adam and Silvana opened their eyes they saw the massive gates in front of them, solid and dense, impossible for any human, or even most Phantoms, to lift.</p><br><p>Then, they noticed a group of people standing a few meters away.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes intently studying them. He immediately realized that they were not Phantoms, their auras were too weak for his level, yet... they were different from anything he had seen before.</p><br><p>'How strange, they look familiar...' he muttered, glaring at the man who was approaching them in a confident stride, 'Their clothes are very similar to military uniforms. I'd say they're military but...'</p><br><p>The reason for Adam's doubts was simple. The basic color of all military uniforms, regardless of their rank or unit was black. Sure, there were some differences, details, and shades, but even a child knew that a man in black was either a government official or a military personnel.</p><br><p>However... the people who met them in front of the gate were completely white.</p><br><p>To assume that they were scientists or medics would be a mistake, for their style of outfit was quite different, austere, formidable, and confident.</p><br><p>In fact, it was the same as all the other military clothes, only white instead of black. Adam couldn't see any other difference, no matter how much he looked.</p><br><p>After a few steps, the man stopped, next to their car. He had short black hair, a stern gaze, and sharp facial features, showing his determination to do his duty no matter what.</p><br><p>On his chest was the number '4', large and prominent, clearly carrying some meaning.</p><br><p>His glare traveled to Seyrina but didn't dwell on her for long, then on Silvana and Adam and, at the very end, on Douglas.</p><br><p>"Mr. Douglas, with all due respect, but you arrived at the lower gate unannounced. Moreover, you brought with you a K2-Phantom and an Operator of the same rank. I'm afraid I can't let them pass any further," the man replied.</p><br><p>His voice was respectful of Douglas, but he wasn't afraid to be rude if necessary.</p><br><p>Still, the smile didn't disappear from Douglas's face, he seemed to have expected such a response and was even satisfied with it.</p><br><p>"Well, you have nothing to worry about. This is Adam Vinter, you can check who he is."</p><br><p>Immediately, the man turned around, looking over his shoulder at his subordinates. The middle-aged woman nodded deeply and took out a tablet, quickly finding all the available information about the young Phantom.</p><br><p>"Hmm... Impressive..." she murmured, "Mr. Douglas, I wouldn't be wrong to assume that Adam Vinter is one step away from K3-Level, right?"</p><br><p>Douglas nodded approvingly.</p><br><p>"You're damn right. He's already figured out how to reduce the creation of the Second Key to a few weeks instead of a thousand years. But, he became so powerful that his energy destroyed his operator. We don't have much time."</p><br><p>The man thought for a moment, he shook his head and turned back to his fellows, they discussed something in a few short phrases.</p><br><p>After a moment he returned, now looking solely at Adam and Silvana.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter, and Silvana Desio. Even if Mr. Douglas wants you to move on, it's still your decision."</p><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana asked:</p><br><p>"Can we turn down such a unique opportunity...?"</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the man nodded. He didn't think her question was inappropriate.</p><br><p>"Yes. What you will see next - you will never be able to forget it. It will forever change your life, your path as Phantom and Operator. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about."</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana froze in place. They hadn't expected to hear such a thing.</p><br><p>Then, they exchanged a glance, and Adam smiled weakly.</p><br><p>He gazed at the man, his voice full of resolve:</p><br><p>"Well, I'm afraid we have no choice but to move on. I can't lose Silvana or stop. And... I won't hide it, my curiosity won't allow me to just walk away. Not after what I heard."</p><br><p>A threatening glint traveled across the man's eyes. He lifted his chin staring at Adam from top to bottom before waving his hand, giving a command to the others.</p><br><p>"Looks like my warning only piqued your interest. I don't know if that's good or bad, but you're right," he said in a serious tone, "There's no turning back after this."</p><br><p>Then, the man turned around and stepped aside, allowing them to drive forward.</p><br><p>With a loud crack, the gates slowly rose, the perfect piece of the puzzle revealing the way forward.</p><br><p>No one said anything, Seyrina only pressed the gas pedal, moving ahead at a low speed.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana looked around breathlessly.</p><br><p>The tunnel ahead of them was the same as the one behind them, but every now and then they met a door indicating that someone or something was lurking behind it.</p><br><p>Was it the Zero Ring?</p><br><p>They didn't know, but it was nothing more than the technical room of the Lower Gate, the only way into the Zero Ring.</p><br><p>Seyrina stopped. She looked uncertainly at Douglas, he only nodded slightly.</p><br><p>"Good, we'll walk from here, we're almost there."</p><br><p>With these words, Seyrina stepped carefully out of the car, leading the others with her. They would have to do it anyway, for after ten meters the road ended, changing to massive steps going up.</p><br><p>As soon as they climbed up, a lonely platform appeared in front of them, unlike the steps it was relatively small.</p><br><p>Not far from the platform was a terminal, a girl with large round glasses stood behind it. At this time she was watching something on the console, a lollipop was clenched between her teeth.</p><br><p>She looked up, a blond lock of hair falling in front of her right eye. A slight curiosity reflected when she saw Seyrina, to Douglas she did not react to a chef seeing his regular customer.</p><br><p>Then, shock covered her face at the sight of the new faces. She was interested in Adam and Silvana.</p><br><p>Douglas smiled broadly as he stepped forward, his hand raised in greeting.</p><br><p>"Nefis, long time no see," Douglas said ironically, for they both knew that wasn't true.</p><br><p>"Pffft, I'm not even sure if I should say anything."</p><br><p>She crossed her arms over her chest with a bored look. After that, her eyes returned to Adam and Silvana.</p><br><p>"However, those two are a different story. Newcomers don't come here often, especially the ones like Adam Vinter, the one showing promise."</p><br><p>Adam was wary. Unlike the squad before the gate, Nefis was aware of his personality and accomplishments. He didn't know if that was good or bad.</p><br><p>Her reaction elicited a genuine laugh from Douglas:</p><br><p>"Hahaha, yeah, you're right. Tonight is the first time they will see the Zero Ring. It's all set."</p><br><p>Nefis rolled her eyes, tired of listening to him.</p><br><p>"I'll bet you've made up your mind as usual."</p><br><p>"Even if it is, I can afford it," he shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>A lonely thought raced through Nefis's mind:</p><br><p>'Unfortunately, that's something I can't argue with, even I can't refuse.'</p><br><p>Then, she waved her hand pointing to the center of the platform.</p><br><p>''In that case, let's not waste any time. Get up on the platform, I'll do the rest."</p><br><p>Douglas was first the others followed him.</p><br><p>Meanwhile, Adam and Silvana looked around, trying to find any clues, but other than walls and doors in the distance, they saw nothing of note.</p><br><p>Nefis nodded and set to work. A few seconds later, she made the last movements on the terminal.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The platform shuddered, the edges glowing as a pale blue barrier whipped upward. It was not solid, like torn fabric, yet it constantly shimmered as a powerful stream.</p><br><p>With a serious expression, Nefis stared at Adam.</p><br><p>"Good luck, both of you."</p><br><p>With the next shudder, the center of the platform shone brightly, as they burst upward.</p><br><p>The platform moved at a crushing speed, almost like a pulse running on a beam of sunlight.</p><br><p>Trying to comprehend what was happening, Adam raised his eyes only to realize that they were already above the surface, over the First Ring, and rapidly continuing to move forward along the ray.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, he noticed something strange. In the sky where nothing should be, high above the clouds, the outline of something great and enormous, the size of a hovering island, was gradually appearing, right above the Citadel.</p><br>
