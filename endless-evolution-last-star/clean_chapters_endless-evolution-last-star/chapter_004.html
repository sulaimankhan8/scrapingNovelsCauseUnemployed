            <h4>Chapter 4: Reflexes</h4><br><p>There was no way Adam could change what had already happened, the artifact was inside him, becoming part of his power, just like the Evolution Tree and Initial Gene. Now, all he could do was accept the artifact and use it to become stronger. </p><br><p>"Right... I'm a Phantom now... I'll be able to make money killing monsters, and the artifact will help me do that! I shouldn't hope for a one-time gain like selling an artifact, it's better to play the long game!" </p><br><p>Then, Adam headed over to Electric Eel and summoned Revolve. Silver Weaver aside, this was the first monster Adam had ever absorbed genes from. </p><br><p>Several blue runes embraced by electricity entered the vortex, heading into his space where his mind was similarly transported. </p><br><p>"Agh...? What's going on?" Adam muttered puzzled, looking at the Evolution Tree and the hovering Electric Eel runes in front of him. </p><br><p>A massive white book with an atom sign on the cover appeared out of the cosmic particles. The book opened, and the Electric Eel's genes headed to the first page, the topmost line. </p><br><p>[The Electric Eel gene has been placed in the Vault!] </p><br><p>[You can open the file of any of your genes for more information.] </p><br><p>"Vault...?" Adam stared at the book that was technically his own database, his collection, and possibly part of the force. </p><br><p>Adam, like a young explorer, advanced towards the Vault and touched the book that had become small enough for him to comfortably hold it. </p><br><p>Absorbed with interest, Adam clicked on the first line where the Electric Eel gene was located. </p><br><p>Then, an image of the Electric Eel flashed before Adam, precise and extensive, as if someone had photographed it during Adam's fight. </p><br><p>[Anomalous Electric Eel (X1) - First Circle, Green Threat Level. </p><br><p>First stage in cognition - Access primary information about the monster and a photo. </p><br><p>Second step in cognition - ??? (10 Neutral Genes required.)] </p><br><p>"10 Neutral Genes? Green Threat Level?" </p><br><p>However, no one was going to answer Adam's questions. The only thing that was clear to him was that the Phantoms' capabilities were far more extensive than he had realized. </p><br><p>He had to acquire new genes and evolve as much as he could. </p><br><p>'Whatever, I have to activate the artifact first, everything else later.' Adam pondered before advancing towards the False Orb, hovering next to the Evolution Tree. </p><br><p>[False Orb (First Rarity Level) </p><br><p>First Trait - ??? (Any gene is required. Given the artifact's rarity level, only genes from monsters of green threat level and above will do.)] </p><br><p>"Oh, I have one!" Adam exclaimed, using the Anomalous Electric Eel gene. </p><br><p>Whoooooooooooooooooooosh. </p><br><p>The rune flew out of the Vault, entering the False Orb. </p><br><p>The artifact trembled as if it was ready to explode at any moment, but as the electrical discharges came out, the artifact returned to normal and began to shine a little brighter. </p><br><p>[First Trait - Lightning Reflexes </p><br><p>Electricity has become a part of you, you may not be able to create lightning at will or cause a cascade of thunder, but with your new reflexes you can dodge them as easily as you dodge a throwing ball] </p><br><p>Adam spent his single gene, activated the Artifact, and was ready to return. </p><br><p>He took one last look at the Evolution Tree, the False Orb, and the Ball of Thread, smiled, and closed his eyes, leaving the inner space. </p><br><p>Adam opened his eyes only to see the vast wasteland and sand dunes again. </p><br><p>The anomaly slowly faded away, the lightning bolts dispersed, and the clouds scattered, for without the artifact, it could not continue to grow and exist. The artifact was the core of any anomaly, constantly releasing its energy outwards. </p><br><p>"Oh, looks like I finally got lucky." Adam smirked, looking at the long line of vehicles in the distance coming down the hill. </p><br><p>Even if the Artifact was no longer there, any anomaly attracted a lot of attention. Everyone knew the value of artifacts, so as long as there was a chance to at least see them, it was worth it. </p><br><br><p>A girl with a long red braid and green eyes shouted out from the first truck. Like all the people in the caravan, she was wearing loose clothes made of wide fabrics, for protection from the ever-present sand. </p><br><p>Adam turned around but did not go to meet her, he just stood still watching the caravan carefully. </p><br><p>One day, Adam climbed an old abandoned tower in a slum that overlooked the Dead Lands. He was lucky enough to see the caravan, but the one in front of him was much larger. </p><br><p>Each armored vehicle had the red fox's head painted on it, staring intently and menacingly. Between the vehicles were several trucks with huge storages, containing both supplies and dead monster carcasses, as well as materials from them. </p><br><br><p>With a kick of her foot, the very same girl stepped outside, heading towards Adam. She cast a quick glance at the dead Electric Eel, nodded slightly, and stopped. </p><br><p>"My name is Lisa, I'm the leader of the Fire Fox Squad and a First Rank Phantom." Lisa said vigorously, extending her hand. </p><br><p>Adam responded to the handshake. </p><br><p>"Adam... Just a loner who was unlucky enough to end up here." </p><br><p>"Hmm? How did you end up here alone? The Scorching Desert is probably the worst area to go hunting alone." Lisa raised an eyebrow in confusion. </p><br><p>Adam didn't answer, instead, he turned around, looking up at the high city walls. </p><br><p>"When do you plan to return? I'd like to join you, temporarily." </p><br><p>Lisa touched her lips, "You don't seem to be particularly social. Were you the one who killed that monster?" </p><br><br><p>"Hey! Stop wasting time! What are you guys up to?!" A voice rang out as a muscular man with a broad sword behind his back that was as big as he was stepped out of the car. </p><br><p>"Oh, that's Jacob, the first captain, the grumpy damn type." Lisa said nonchalantly. </p><br><p>"What? I just don't want to put our squad in danger. The sooner we get out of here the better. That the anomaly is clearing was obvious before we stopped." Jacob said, scratching the back of his head with an annoyed expression. </p><br><p>Lisa glanced at the anomaly and asked, "Did you collect the artifact? I'm sorry, but if you want to join us, we want 3% of its value." </p><br><p>Adam shook his head. </p><br><p>"Agh? Do you really think we're going to take you along for free!" Jacob frowned. </p><br><p>Adam glanced at the center of the anomaly, "I didn't collect the artifact, I absorbed it, so there's no way I can give it to you." </p><br><p>Lisa and Jacob's eyes went wide, they were clearly surprised by something, though Adam had absolutely no idea why. </p><br><p>"Hahahahahahaha! Dude, you are one hell of a lucky guy!" Lisa laughed, "Going out alone on a hunt in the Scorching Desert, being the first one near an anomaly, and getting the right artifact for your Evolution Tree and Initial Gene! Damn, I even got tired while I was listing all that." </p><br><p>Adam's eyes sparkled, then he tilted his head, and his gaze grew darker. </p><br><p>"Every great fortune was preceded by an equally great failure..." Adam uttered, while images from the experiment flashed before his face, especially the scientist's face. </p><br><p>Lisa shrugged, "Okay, then we want 20% of the materials from that monster." Lisa pointed at the Electric Eel, "Transportation and sales we'll handle ourselves, as a bonus food and water, how's that?" </p><br><p>Adam shook his head, "Fine. I just want to get home, the rest isn't that important." </p><br><p>Then, Adam turned around, directing his gaze to a distant point - Morton Observatory, where was the one who had already become his target forever. Until the death of one of them.</p>
