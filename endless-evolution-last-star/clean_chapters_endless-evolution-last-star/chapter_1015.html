            <br><p>As soon as Arnoth's words were spoken, Adam's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>All his battles ran through his mind in a single stream, hundreds of fragments, until he stopped at the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><br><p>Because he was also one of the two higher types?</p><br><p>Because Kyros had a title as well as Arnoth?</p><br><br><p>It was much simpler than that.</p><br><p>They both had a partner. For the Crimson Monarch, it was Moira, and for Arnoth, it turned out to be the mysterious maiden - Lost Light.</p><br><p>The difference between the two was that Moira was a monster like the Crimson Monarch. She was lucky that he saved her, keeping her mind, letting her live inside his Evolution Tree, just like Adam did.</p><br><br><p>She wasn't looking to Arnoth for salvation. She was his partner, part of his power and himself.</p><br><p>Adam was left with only one question.</p><br><p>Who was Lost Light in his world? Was it Lone Blaze because they were both the External Artifacts?</p><br><p>Or... was it Silvana because she was his main partner and the most important person in his life?</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam's pupils returned to normal when he first saw Lost Light's lips come into motion, yet her eyes remained closed.</p><br><p>"Arnoth..." she whispered. "You must finish what you started... We must finish what we started... But, no cruelty or harshness. We must be grateful to our adversary - for meeting again on the battlefield."</p><br><p>Without a hidden thought, Arnoth nodded deeply. It seemed that, other than Adam, Lost Light was the only being he was willing to listen to.</p><br><p>Ally or foe. They could both be equally important to a great warrior.</p><br><p>However, an enemy was to die, and an ally, his partner, was to stay together until the very end.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter. No, just Adam." Arnoth shook his head with a bitter smile. "Do you have anything to say?"</p><br><p>After a while, Adam gulped as he leaned forward.</p><br><p>"Yes... You and me. After Lost Light appeared, once you unleashed your power as a Crucible Type monster."</p><br><p>His throat went dry.</p><br><p>"Do I still have a chance of defeating you?"</p><br><p>It didn't take long for the answer to come.</p><br><p>"Unfortunately for both of us - no. It's over. For both you and the serpents. I must regain my strength, bring Kreyna back to life, and destroy this place that became my home for a few months."</p><br><p>Arnoth turned, looking at the destroyed Fallen Ring Castle with a bright smile.</p><br><p>This place was another battlefield for him. It was one more step on the path to power and to accomplishing his task as a monster who was far older than the young, clueless serpents and Adam.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Adam's aura trembled as a black coat covered his body.</p><br><p>As a last resort, he decided to use one of his trump cards. He knew that petrification didn't work to its full potential, even against Vorx.</p><br><p>But what else could he do?</p><br><p>He could only hope for his Initial Gene, Lone Blaze, and Moira.</p><br><p>However, there was no hint of hope in his eyes. His path had failed - it couldn't kill Arnoth and only allowed him to show his true nature.</p><br><p>This was an unfair battle from the beginning.</p><br><p>"Oh, is that...?" Arnoth reached out a hand when the two amber eyes on Adam's collar opened wide.</p><br><p>A wave of petrification traveled through the throne room, quickly sweeping over Arnoth.</p><br><p>A thin layer of stone covered his fingertips, but with the next shudder of his aura, the stone shattered into tiny fragments.</p><br><p>"Wait, Adam... You're hiding not one essence, but two? This..." Arnoth narrowed his eyes, the bright light flaring. "It's a monster... but without a physical body... It's inside you?"</p><br><p>Adam didn't know how, but Arnoth had just one look to see what was happening in his inner space.</p><br><p>Then, something in Arnoth's posture changed. He staggered backward, touching his head as if he were trying to put the puzzles together into a coherent picture.</p><br><p>"You fought against the Crimson Monarch, didn't you?"</p><br><p>Adam didn't answer anything, but there was no need to. Arnoth already had it all figured out.</p><br><p>"Sure, you mentioned it. Only a monster like him could save another... Adam."</p><br><p>Arnoth stared at him, about to say something impossible even for him to say.</p><br><p>"You're too young to realize that, but... Do you have any idea what kind of energy control it takes to save a creature even though it lost its physical body? What mastery does it require to keep a physical being alive in the form of energy?"</p><br><p>True, Adam never really thought about it. He knew that the Crimson Monarch saved Moira a long time ago. It made them partners, but even after talking to Moira he couldn't find out too many details.</p><br><p>"Hah, and... still that monster inside you. The Crimson Monarch did an incredible job. It's a masterpiece... so far, nothing has happened to you or that monster inside you."</p><br><p>Confusion covered Adam's face as he stepped away from the column. "Wait! What are you talking about? That monster, her name is Moira... And, I did the same thing Kyros did. I took her into my inner space and sacrificed a part of myself so she could stay here!"</p><br><p>In response, Arnoth only shook his head, showing that Adam knew too little about both Moira and Kyros's true mastery.</p><br><p>"Moira, then, right? Look... Adam. Her shell was created by the Crimson Monarch. He put her life into a form of energy, so he saved her. But you're not the Crimson Monarch, you're not capable of what he was. At least not now."</p><br><p>He looked at Adam with a serious expression as if he wanted to warn him of imminent disaster.</p><br><p>"Your power is growing, your Evolution Tree is getting stronger, but not Moira. You don't know how to change her shell, because you didn't create it. Eventually, when you take a few more steps forward, your power will just crush her inside your inner space. Your power will destroy her form and consciousness - turning her into an energy that will greedily consume your Evolution Tree."</p><br><br><p>Arnoth stepped forward confidently, Lost Light hugging him tighter.</p><br><p>"But, don't worry. I won't let that happen. Like I said - I will take your soul, Adam, and with that, I will free Moira. She's the only legacy left after the Crimson Monarch."</p>
