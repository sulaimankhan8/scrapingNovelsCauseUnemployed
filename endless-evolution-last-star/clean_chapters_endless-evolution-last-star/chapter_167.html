            <br><p>Kayla had a special position in this battle - she was the most important member of the team, as without her, Adam and Edir would have no way to continue fighting further.</p><br><p>Sure, without Adam and Edir, it would be impossible to talk about victory because for that they needed pure firepower. But, they had two attackers in their squad and only one support.</p><br><p>To some extent, Adam and Edir depended on Kayla, and they realized it.</p><br><p>So, as soon as Prago made her his target, Adam and Edir reacted instantly.</p><br><p>Their attack was done simultaneously, almost perfectly, not only because they knew what to do but shared one desire and goal - to protect Kayla. She made them stronger and healed them - becoming the core of their force.</p><br><br><br><p>The impact threw Prago aside, forcing his back into the wall.</p><br><p>However, unlike Adam and Edir, who had taken serious damage from Prago's attacks, Prago was barely hurt. Sure, he had a bloody nose, but that wasn't exactly an accomplishment, especially since they were able to catch Prago off guard.</p><br><p>"Well, looks like we're still lacking in firepower. Tsk. He was tougher than I expected, it's probably an effect of his artifact." Edir snorted irritably, realizing that they would have to work hard before they could do any meaningful damage to Prago.</p><br><p>That was a serious complication because even a few of Edir's direct attacks were not enough to surpass Prago's one powerful strike.</p><br><p>"Bastards. You think you can stop me always?" Prago greatly grimaced as his pupils flashed and energy traveled towards his halberd.</p><br><p>Adam and Edir became wary, simultaneously jumping back and getting into fighting stances.</p><br><p>The problem was that they didn't know all of his abilities. Sure, Edir had fought Prago before, but he couldn't force Prago to use his full arsenal against him. All Prago showed in that fight was just a few abilities, he didn't use his Nexus Traits.</p><br><p>That was not surprising since Edir was a K1-Phantom and Prago was a K2-Phantom, a K2-Phantom couldn't be so weak that in a 1 vs. 1, he would need all his arsenal against K1-Phantom.</p><br><p>"You can make one successful attack, so you think you've won? Hah, screw it. I'll deal with you right now, and the first one will be that annoying bitch!" Prago roared before stepping forward.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, he acted much faster this time since this move was part of his First Nexus Trait.</p><br><p>A blue flash went through his entire body as he thrust his halberd forward in a heartbeat, instantly tilting his body and pushing his arms out.</p><br><p>It happened so fast that Adam and Edir had literally a split second to react and make a decision. There was no time to do anything, they could only rely on their instincts.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Prago's halberd released a dense stream of water that was not blue but white, like the waves of a mighty waterfall as tons of water rushed down.</p><br><p>The stream was more like a laser that reached Kayla almost immediately, even though she was more than ten meters away from Prago.</p><br><br><p>Edir was closer to Prago than Adam, so he acted first. Edir quickly clapped his hands together, blasting his blue flame right in front of the water stream.</p><br><p>Splashes of water flew apart, the smallest of them turning into ice crystals, but... it clearly wasn't enough.</p><br><p>The rest of the stream quickly moved on, breaking through the water splash and throwing Edir aside with a shockwave.</p><br><p>Then, next in line was Adam, who already knew what he was going to do.</p><br><p>Apparently, his needle was too thin for him to use to defend himself and absorb the force of the stream, but he could do something else - attack back!</p><br><br><p>Adam pierced the stream with his needle, splitting it into several pieces that scattered in random directions and possessed only a fraction of the original power.</p><br><p>However... Adam had completely forgotten that his needle was not invulnerable.</p><br><p>Of all the opponents he had fought before, the Steel Knight had done the most damage to his threads with his razor-sharp swords, but Prago's water stream had even more destructive force.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, watching as the water tore his needle apart, starting from the tip and quickly approaching the rather thick and particularly strong base.</p><br><p>Sure, the flow slowed slightly, but it wasn't enough to use up all the energy of the Nexus Trait.</p><br><p>Prago smirked. He realized that the power of the water stream wasn't enough to hurt Kayla, but if it could do serious damage to Adam, it was a worthy result.</p><br><p>'Shit!' Edir inwardly exclaimed, seeing Adam's needle shattered, but, no sooner had the water stream reached his hand than a palm covered in a dense layer of silver threads with sharp claws appeared in front of it.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Using Silver Claws, Adam tried to squeeze the water stream, gradually succeeding and breaking its remains apart until there wasn't even a single splash left.</p><br><p>Sure, almost all of the threads on his palm were torn apart, exposing his skin, but... it could easily be fixed, just needed a few seconds.</p><br><p>A couple of threads from the top of the gauntlet, moved towards his palm, completely closing the gap.</p><br><p>Prago frowned. He hadn't expected Adam to use his Second Order so soon and not even lose it.</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Kayla, made sure she was okay, and nodded slightly.</p><br><p>"Hey, I think it's time to move on to more action, don't you? He's already used Nexus, so... we're one step ahead." Adam said seriously, turning to Kayla.</p><br><p>Kayla nodded, narrowing her eyes. They had a prepared plan, and she knew what she had to do.</p><br><p>Then, she clenched her fists tightly, and the tips of her long green hair shone brightly with a golden light.</p><br><p>Her hair lifted slightly, to shoulder level, and a multitude of golden lights appeared above her - like portals to other worlds.</p><br><p>"Go!" Kayla exclaimed, and at the same moment, golden ghostly hands flew out of the lights like a hail of arrows raining down on Prago.</p><br><p>Before Prago could realize anything, Adam and Edir were rushing forward - blue cold flames and silver claws were right before his face.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Prago, K2-Phantom and proud Warden of the Fall Hill Prison felt a chill run down his back - that was a harbinger of fear.</p><br><p>Another fraction of a second and Adam's claws would sink into his face, precisely piercing his defenses and tearing him apart, severely damaging and disfiguring him.</p><br><p>"No! Get away from me!" Prago exclaimed fearfully, clutching his halberd tightly and quickly using his Second Nexus Trait as his only option to get out of this situation.</p><br><br><p>Prago collapsed the halberd to the ground, causing the entire arena to shake and triggering the destructive waves that soon reached Adam and Edir, throwing them aside.</p><br><br><p>A silver needle stabbed into the ground, while sharp claws advanced through the water flow - splitting it.</p><br><p>Then, realizing that his time was running out, Adam lightly swung his fingers, releasing five smooth silver threads right in front of Prago's face, causing his eyes to go wide with fear.</p>
