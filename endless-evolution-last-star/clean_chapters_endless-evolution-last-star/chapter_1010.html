            <br><p>Almost 90% of all the battles at the Fallen Ring Castle came to their logical end. The Light Legion troops could do nothing against the resistance forces. Without the Light Guardians and without the goliaths, the serpents were much stronger - the knights and soldiers were too weak to suppress the rebellion.</p><br><p>Thus, Grita and Torz found the resolve to run to the first floor of the castle a few minutes after Risha's battle ended.</p><br><p>Now that the serpents had surrounded the castle and the last of the Light Legion troops were hiding in the lower levels, they could do so.</p><br><br><p>Torz and Grita quickly ran forward, to Risha who was leaning against a column. A slight smirk played on her face, she was exhausted, but every time she looked at what was left of Kreyna she felt better.</p><br><p>She didn't need a noble victory like Adam and Arnoth desired. The simple destruction of an enemy that pissed her off was more than enough to fill her heart with joy.</p><br><p>The footsteps made her turn around - two silhouettes and two serpents were rushing to her aid.</p><br><p>Well, they knew she didn't need help, she had already won, but they couldn't just stand by.</p><br><p>"Hey, how are you?" Grita leaned over, touching her shoulder encouragingly.</p><br><p>Risha smirked, pointing at Kreyna's remains. "Hah, not so good, but a million times better than that bitch."</p><br><p>The initially skeptical Torz grinned widely. He seemed to be happier than most about this development.</p><br><p>"Damn, Risha! That was fucking awesome! You killed her! No more... No more controlling our brothers and sisters... No more torturing serpents!"</p><br><p>Yet, Grita couldn't afford to smile.</p><br><p>And soon the smiles disappeared, and the faces of every serpent who thought that victory was already in their hands.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A shudder went through the entire castle - devastating light rays shot in all directions, sweeping through the thick walls and great columns that stood motionless for decades.</p><br><p>Even the first floor that had withstood Vorx's blast and Kreyna's dark sphere was no exception.</p><br><p>Debris, along with dust, fell downward.</p><br><br><p>Cracks appeared in the ceiling directly above Risha.</p><br><p>Grita and Torz looked up. In a heartbeat, they grabbed Risha and quickly ran out of the first floor of the castle.</p><br><p>A destructive ray came down on the spot where Risha had just been. She could see everything over Grita's shoulder.</p><br><p>"Fuck..." Risha gasped, slowly lifting her gaze upward. "What the hell is going on up there?"</p><br><p>"I don't know, but... we should have been ready for this." Torz shook his head, his fists clenched tightly. "Arnoth, that bastard. He's interested in nothing but winning, and he's willing to destroy everything along the way!"</p><br><p>Grita nodded, exiting the golden gate.</p><br><p>"Yeah, and most importantly, he has enough power to do so. All we can hope for is Adam and Heret."</p><br><p>At the same moment, something made the three of them raise their heads - a body flew out of the second floor, risking a fall among the ruined houses.</p><br><p>"What...?" Grita gulped, as her face turned pale. In a heartbeat, she sped up.</p><br><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Dense electrical discharges surrounded Adam. Most of the thorns on his wreath were already shining brightly. A little more, and he could activate his Foundation Artifact.</p><br><p>'Damn, that was faster than I expected, though...' Adam pondered as he whizzed past the dozens of rays. 'Considering what the fuck is going on here, it's not surprising. With that attack, Arnoth could kill hundreds of monsters, but he's using all that power just against me.'</p><br><p>Arnoth was serious. It didn't matter what he thought of Adam. If he was fighting against someone, he dared not disrespect them.</p><br><br><p>One of the beams slammed into the column, causing the debris to fall next to Heret.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>'Fuck! I directed all my attention to Arnoth. I forgot about Heret! He's injured... He shouldn't be here!'</p><br><p>Using the last seconds he had left before filling the wreath, Adam tore forward, dashing through the light rays.</p><br><p>A few grazed him, leaving cuts on his shoulders and sides, but it didn't matter.</p><br><br><p>In a quick dash, Adam grabbed Heret by the legs and, with all his might, threw him forward. He couldn't risk carrying Heret on his shoulders.</p><br><p>For the leader of the resistance, this fight had long since reached its end.</p><br><p>Arnoth slowly turned in his direction.</p><br><p>"Oh, how generous of you."</p><br><p>The rays of light stopped - hundreds of craters covered the throne room, almost no columns were left intact.</p><br><p>"So, now that we are left 1 on 1, as we should be from the beginning. Will you show me what this wreath can do?"</p><br><p>Adam smirked as energy new to Arnoth appeared around him - crimson one.</p><br><p>"Hell yeah. You can consider this a special occasion. This is a combination I haven't used before - this will be the first time!"</p><br><p>His needle disintegrated into particles, making room for the crimson sword.</p><br><p>'The Foundation Artifact and the Power Gene. What could be better?' Adam smirked, channeling all the energy from the wreath to the dual sword.</p><br><p>Silvana's voice appeared. 'Be careful. There's no telling how powerful this attack is.'</p><br><p>"Yeah, sure... But, at the very least, I have one chance for a mistake, right?'</p><br><p>A slight smile reflected on Silvana's face.</p><br><p>'No doubts. I'm willing to take some of your pain on myself.'</p><br><br><p>Arnoth took a step back. He saw that it was something more powerful than a weak path.</p><br><p>"Good to see you can still surprise me. Go ahead, break my shield if you so desire!"</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam clutched his sword tightly with both hands and made a high-speed thrust.</p><br><p>The crimson energy, along with purple lightning, blasted through the throne room, crashing into the very center of Arnoth's shield.</p><br><p>For the first time in their entire battle, a shiver went through Arnoth's body, his feet sliding along the ground, leaving two smooth furrows.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The plates flew off to the sides, one by one, destroying the layers of his shield, causing Adam's eyes to widen in excitement.</p><br><p>But... Soon, the delight was replaced by fright.</p><br><p>Piece by piece, in the center of the shield, unfolded an amber core - several times larger than the one that gave strength to the warrior goliath.</p>
