            <br><p>Several maids and makeup artists surrounded the lone girl on all sides. The girl was a high noble, so she was already prettier than most of her peers, but today she was going to exceed all expectations.</p><br><p>An entire group of servants paid attention to every detail, from her feet and pedicure to her gorgeous pink hair and heavy makeup.</p><br><p>Her pink eyes were wide open, reflecting in the massive mirror, she was sitting in the same spot for hours now.</p><br><p>Before that, the maids spent a lot of time washing every inch of her body, using all sorts of expensive gels, shampoos, soaps, and more. Then, they put on her a luxurious bridal gown that cost as much as several annual salaries of a wealthy man from the Second Ring.</p><br><p>Now, she waited patiently for the makeup artists and maids to finish their work, which lasted from early morning before the sun had a chance to rise.</p><br><p>Even though it was the wedding day, there was no smile or joy on the girl's face, her expression was devoid of emotion. She just stared at the mirror with a detached look, like a doll waiting to be dressed up.</p><br><br><p>Confident, stern footsteps sounded behind her, overly high heels clacking on the marble floor, heading toward the girl. A luxurious, tight dress of mostly red and pink colors was reflected in a large mirror in the distance.</p><br><p>The maids and makeup artists immediately turned around, bowed low at the same time, and said respectfully: "Mrs. Mariel! We are pleased to welcome you!"</p><br><p>The middle-aged woman with shoulder-length pink hair and the same shining eyes smirked, licking her lush lips.</p><br><p>"Keep working, don't get distracted. You don't have much time left." Mariel nonchalantly replied, stepping forward.</p><br><p>"Yes!" The servants replied, following her order.</p><br><p>Approaching the girl, Mariel examined her from various angles and bit down on her pinky finger with an excited look.</p><br><p>"Oh... Osana, my sweet, little angel." Mariel uttered with a sweet smile, touching Osana's shoulders.</p><br><p>In response, Osana didn't even look at her mother, her gaze was directed forward as before. However, this did not embarrass Mariel in any way.</p><br><p>"You're far from the most obedient child, but there's nothing wrong with that. You've played the rebel for a bit, but now it's time to be an adult and fulfill your duty to your family."</p><br><p>Then, Mariel leaned over to Osana's, taking a deep breath.</p><br><p>"Agh... What a flavor. I'm sure your groom will be pleased, this night, right after the wedding, he'll get all of you, as well as what lies beneath that gorgeous dress."</p><br><p>Throwing one last glance at Osana, Mariel turned around, heading for the exit with wide steps.</p><br><p>"In thirty minutes she should be ready. If you don't make it in time, I swear on my family's name, you will never be able to work in the First Ring or even in the Second Ring again." Mariel said arrogantly, addressing the maids and makeup artists.</p><br><p>The maids flinched and sped up slightly, even though they worked for the Rouzet Family, they were ordinary people. If Mariel wanted to, she could easily make their lives hell.</p><br><p>As Mariel walked away, not even the echo of her heels could be heard, Osana's expression changed drastically.</p><br><p>She clenched her teeth, her veins swelled with anger and her face contorted in disgust. Her aura intensified causing a chill to go down the backs of the servants realizing how she felt, but they were forced to continue their work.</p><br><p>Weddings between the Twelve Branches were a rare and important event, even if it was a wedding between two Hallow Nobles, so when it came to a wedding between two Light Nobles, the stakes were as high as possible.</p><br><p>Unlike Osana, Mariel was beyond happy. It wasn't just that after this wedding, the relationship between their families would be even stronger, giving them an advantage over the other families of the Twelve Branches.</p><br><p>In this case, it was the Rouzet Family that was the biggest beneficiary from this wedding since they were the receiving part.</p><br><p>A member of the Marzo Family wanted to marry Osana, so they paid most of the wedding expenses, held it on the Rouzet Family's property, gave many valuable gifts, and as an unspoken rule, were willing to offer lucrative deals soon after the wedding.</p><br><p>The preparations for the wedding began quite some time ago, from the formalities to something more substantial and material.</p><br><p>Nobles never held weddings closed, moreover, though not everyone agreed with it, there was a long-standing rule that any of the Twelve Branches could receive an invitation to a wedding even if it was an unfriendly family.</p><br><p>Well, most of the time, families that had bad relations simply ignored each other's weddings and important events, but sometimes certain members decided to attend as well.</p><br><p>Ordinary nobles, influential and rich people, high-ranking military, and strong Phantoms, also often received invitations, it was the decision of the two families responsible for the wedding.</p><br><p>"Ms. Osana, you look superb! Your groom will only need to look at you once to fall in love with you forever! He will be enchanted, I'm sure!"</p><br><p>One of the maids uttered with a kind smile on her face.</p><br><p>Osana's eyes shifted to her, showing her a cold, menacing stare.</p><br><p>The maid gulped, her face turning paler.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry... I won't say anything more." The maid muttered and went back to her work.</p><br><p>Looking at her reflection in the mirror, at the maids and makeup artists doing their best to make Osana appear as good as possible, she could only think of one thing:</p><br><p>'Eighty-five days after we met, the day has come. I'm sitting here preparing for the event that will take away my freedom... I'm too weak and don't have enough power to make a difference, but you can.'</p><br><p>Osana smiled bitterly as her gaze deepened.</p><br><p>Your adventure continues at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>'Adam... I wonder what you are doing now when you are only hours away from your arrival?'</p><br><p>Sometimes, even the highest nobles needed the help of someone who had just recently lived in the slums, never even dreaming of being in the First Ring.</p><br><p>Now, Osana's fate depended on this Phantom.</p>
