            <br><p>Nobles had different attitudes towards their status. Some saw it as no big deal, trying to do the best they were capable of, anything to achieve their goals.</p><br><p>However, this was not such a large part of the nobility.</p><br><p>Many nobles, especially among the high ones, saw themselves as special. Well, they were, after all, out of millions of people they were born into twelve families.</p><br><p>From childhood, they had not just money and power, but also something that could not be bought - a powerful bloodline that allowed many of them to become Phantoms.</p><br><p>That the nobles considered themselves better than others was not surprising, but everyone knew the limits of what was allowed. After all, besides luxury and status, they had obligations.</p><br><p>The higher nobles knew that there was no failure worse than ruining their reputation and casting a shadow over their family.</p><br><p>Some went too far, trying to protect not only their honor but also the nobles they looked up to.</p><br><p>Kenna was one of those.</p><br><p>She wasn't mad at Adam for beating Giselle. He won fairly because he was stronger - there was no changing that.</p><br><p>However, once she learned the reason for his brutality, there was nothing but indignation left in her.</p><br><p>It didn't matter to Kenna that Giselle herself had asked Adam for such a demand. In her mind, there was no possible situation where the life of a commoner, not a Phantom, was equal to the life of a high noble.</p><br><p>From Kenna's point of view, the only true solution in such a situation was for Adam to apologize for his pledge.</p><br><p>Kenna actually believed that she was right.</p><br><p>But... Did it matter if she was right or severely wrong?</p><br><p>They weren't in a classroom with textbooks in their hands but on a battlefield. Here, the stronger one was the right one.</p><br><p>Unfortunately for Kenna, she didn't realize that her words would cause Adam not shame for his actions, but cold rage.</p><br><p>White streams of energy in an active swirl filled Adam's fist. It wasn't an ability, but his Global Gene.</p><br><p>For K0 and K1 Phantoms, a fist punch full of energy would have equaled an ability, at these stages, abilities were rarely complex and layered.</p><br><p>For K3-Phantom, it was a simple blow, but powerful enough to end someone's life.</p><br><p>"What the hell are you doing?!"</p><br><p>Kenna spat out, yelling menacingly at Adam.</p><br><p>"I didn't agree to the fight. How dare you attack me, you animal!"</p><br><p>With those words, Kenna tried to crawl away to the side, but Adam's foot all but pinned her wrist firmly to the ground. Then, his knee crashed into her thigh, pressing her to the surface even harder.</p><br><p>His distant wheeze rang out:</p><br><p>"You didn't agree to the fight? Well, as far as I know, that's not necessary."</p><br><p>Coldness filled his eyes, staring intently at Kenna.</p><br><p>"I don't want a twilight coin from you. I just want you to regret what you said, so you'll always remember this day as your worst nightmare."</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Kenna didn't continue to argue because Adam was right.</p><br><p>Then, she realized something. This was a fight, which meant she could use the rules of the Twilight Palace as well as anyone in her position.</p><br><p>Abruptly, Kenna jerked her head to meet her gaze with observer no. 3. The blond-haired man kept a faint smile on his face as he watched, clearly pleased with the result of his actions.</p><br><p>Kenna's mouth opened, but no sooner did the first words come out than Adam's palm covered her mouth.</p><br><p>Glaring at him, Kenna flinched in fear. She didn't understand how Adam realized so quickly what she wanted to do.</p><br><p>"Oh..." Adam shook his head, "I understand you don't like it, you're a high noble, you're used to doing only what you want, well, what a pity. I'm of a different opinion."</p><br><p>Without another word, Adam's fist slammed into Kenna's stomach once again.</p><br><p>It didn't take long for the new flow of blood to the next wave of pain. Her eyes went wide, if she could, she would have screamed in full force, but only muffled moans came out of Adam's palm.</p><br><p>With a look full of anger, Kenna stared at Adam.</p><br><p>Then, her eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>Energy surged out in all directions, about to turn into something more, the ability to hurt Adam.</p><br><p>Yet, he didn't even pay attention to it, he chose to hit Kenna again, right in the face.</p><br><p>Nearly passing out, Kenna barely survived Adam's hit, helped by the fact that she had stored up energy before the blow.</p><br><p>'No...' she internally muttered, 'This can't go on. I have to do something, I have to find a way to stop the fight.'</p><br><p>An idea came quickly, she couldn't speak, but she had other ways to give up.</p><br><br><p>Kenna raised her hand about to slam the ground three times, this would make the observer stop their fight, which would be her salvation.</p><br><p>However, no sooner had she touched the floor than she felt something strange.</p><br><p>She had no control over her hand, and couldn't even twitch her fingertips.</p><br><p>Turning her eyes to the side, she saw her arm twisted at strange angles. It was broken in many places and was now nothing more than a bag of bones and blood.</p><br><p>Without wasting a moment, Kenna lifted the other arm, but as Adam's frame shuddered, the same thing happened to her left arm.</p><br><p>A second later, a new flash of pain whipped at Kenna.</p><br><p>She looked down, her wide-open eyes reflecting Adam's fist plunged into her stomach.</p><br><p>Then, his voice reached her ears.</p><br><p>"Honestly, I don't see how you can be a Phantom and be so disregardful of Operators."</p><br><p>He leaned in, their gazes meeting at a dangerous proximity.</p><br><p>"I do not care who Silvana is by birth, commoner or nobleman. She's my Operator, my partner... and that's all that matters."</p><br><p>Silvana quietly gasped, despite the violent scene, her heart began to beat faster.</p><br><p>"And..." Adam wheezed, "You'll see how much I value her life. I assure you, it's far more important to me than yours."</p><br><p>Observer no. 3, who started the events by his words, chuckled briefly.</p><br><p>'Hah, who would have thought my mischief would lead to such...' he glanced at Silvana, 'Curious changes.'</p>
