            <br><p>The Crimson Monarch enjoyed Adam's confused look.</p><br><p>One knew too much, the other had lived less than the first in a deep sleep.</p><br><p>Yet, they were equal opponents, for neither age, nor knowledge, nor even time were measures of strength.</p><br><p>It was a power that decided who would live and who would not.</p><br><p>However, none of this made any sense at all. The Crimson Monarch's words were not an attempt to hurt Adam or provoke him, they were a bitter truth that the Crimson Monarch himself may not be happy about.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, staring intently at the Crimson Monarch as his target. He realized that his opponent was strong, but he had every chance to win.</p><br><p>"If I defeat you, will you tell me more about it?"</p><br><p>The answer followed immediately:</p><br><p>"Don't even hope for that. Not on your victory, nor on me telling you anything."</p><br><p>The slight smile and any emotion disappeared from the Crimson Monarch's face, only cold seriousness and a fixed gaze remained.</p><br><p>"Looks like I underestimated you. I won't be able to kill you quickly, but... it's not like I have to do it."</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, the Crimson Monarch appeared right in front of Adam, his fist aiming for Adam's chest.</p><br><p>At the last moment, Adam managed to block, defending himself from the Crimson Monarch's punch.</p><br><p>However, the Crimson Monarch had no intention of defeating Adam in close combat, he had no plans at all to continue their fight amongst the temple's rubble.</p><br><p>Before Adam could realize anything, the Crimson Monarch bent down to the ground placing his palms against the cold surface.</p><br><p>"The monsters here may not be able to even scratch you now, but they have accomplished their goal perfectly. The river is full of blood, the ritual is complete and the timing is... perfect."</p><br><p>Obviously, the Crimson Monarch was talking about the Eclipse.</p><br><p>In most cases, the large number of monsters created competition between them, and it became a problem for someone strong, but not for the Conqueror Type and especially not for the Overlord Type.</p><br><p>The more monsters there were, the better the situation was for the Crimson Monarch, as they were all willing to become his servants voluntarily. His aura and the power he could give to the monsters was undeniable.</p><br><p>[Shit, Adam! Stop him right now!]</p><br><p>Lone Blaze's shout pierced through Adam's mind. He nodded quickly and turned into a fiery flash, the silver needle reflected with a glint in the walls ready to sever the head of the Crimson Monarch with a single slash.</p><br><br><p>A thick layer of blood came out of nowhere, covering the Crimson Monarch with an impenetrable barrier. He didn't even glance at Adam, concentrating on controlling the bloody river.</p><br><p>The needle crashed into the barrier, but it failed to leave even a lone cut. A rough recoil went through Adam's entire body, showing that breaking the barrier wouldn't be easy at all.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze understood that as well. Its scream of panic echoed through Adam's mind.</p><br><p>[Hurry! Use the last crystal of the sun seal! You have to kill him while you still have the chance!]</p><br><p>Adam's eyebrow twitched in annoyance. He could feel how much Lone Blaze was afraid, the fear of the Crimson Monarch consumed it completely, overshadowing all common sense.</p><br><p>"Calm down or I'll just ignore you. If you want to help then give decent combat advice. I'll deal with the barrier without using your trump card."</p><br><p>Before Lone Blaze could respond, Adam's eyes flashed brightly as he got into a fighting stance.</p><br><p>White dense energy flowed along his needle, forming a path from him to the other side of the temple, in the very center was the barrier and the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch felt the threat coming from Adam, but he couldn't stop, it was too late.</p><br><p>He had to take the risk and withstand Adam's attack.</p><br><p>"Monarch of Crimson Thunder, your arrogance and pride will destroy you. You are not my first opponent for whom it will be the reason of defeat."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch heard Adam's every word, the distance between them was not so great, yet it was not a stopping point for him. He wasn't afraid to be arrogant, it was his essence as the Overlord Type monster.</p><br><p>Adam closed his eyes, slowly taking the first step forward.</p><br><p>In the blink of an eye, his silhouette moved along the snow-white path, he spent one of his trump cards, hoping to end the fight right here and now.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch gulped, his palms tightly placed on the ground, he was not allowed to interrupt the process.</p><br><p>He was strong and possessed power, but fear was as familiar to him as any living creature, yet fear had no control over him.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam found himself at the end of a white path, he moved from one point to another faster than the wind currents.</p><br><p>Only seconds later, powerful gusts of wind whipped up behind him, shaking his coat and scattering rocks to the side.</p><br><p>The bloody barrier protecting the Crimson Monarch didn't even last a moment, it shattered like an unstable layer of water.</p><br><br><p>A stream of blood gushed from the right side of the Crimson Monarch, he lost a piece the size of a third of his torso, assuming that the Crimson Monarch managed to dodge at the last moment.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's heavy breathing diverged along the temple. His gaze became exhausted and his face turned pale.</p><br><p>His hands never left the ground even for a second. At the moment of Adam's attack, he jerked his body to the side as far as possible.</p><br><p>Otherwise, Adam wouldn't just pierce the Crimson Monarch's chest, the white path would wipe him out.</p><br><p>Adam's legs trembled as he fell to one knee. He put a lot of his strength into this attack, yet he was unable to reach his goal.</p><br><p>"Grh... Good attempt..."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch grunted with difficulty, the wound was gradually recovering but only with the effect of the irregular energy. The Crimson Monarch could not devote his time to it.</p><br><p>"But... The radius was too small. Adam, you didn't manage to win quickly."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the fortress and the Lands of the Lone Serpent shuddered, the blood in the raging river growing more active, wanting to head to the very top - to the surface.</p>
