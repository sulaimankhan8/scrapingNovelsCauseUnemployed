            <br><p>In Third Ring, near Fort Norton, Adam stood in front of the door to one of the large apartment complexes with over ten stories in each house.</p><br><p>He rang the bell, and soon, the door opened. It took a few minutes, but it was remarkably quick, considering it was deep night and most people were asleep now, especially those who had to go to work tomorrow.</p><br><p>"Adam...?" Jena muttered with her eyes wide open. Unlike her strict doctor's uniform, she was now in blue pajamas with a pattern of teddy bears floating on clouds. Nothing out of the ordinary for pajamas.</p><br><p>Adam picked up a bag filled with various snacks, drinks, and sweets.</p><br><p>"Sorry to intrude so abruptly, but how about we watch some stupid shows?"</p><br><p>Jena glanced at Adam's all-black suit, blinked a few times, and smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"Hah, I won't hide it. I'd rather have you rip those pajamas off me right here and now, but... Your option is more than worthy it, too. Come on in." Jena uttered, stepping aside.</p><br><p>This was Adam's first time in Jena's apartment, but her smile made him immediately feel cozy.</p><br><p>Deep down, he hoped he would be welcome in this place, and his hopes were realized.</p><br><p>Nothing happened that night that Adam hadn't warned about in advance. They just ate snacks and watched shows.</p><br><p>Sure, Jena wanted things to go a little further, but she suppressed the feeling since she knew today wasn't the right day.</p><br><p>As enjoyable as the process was, everything had its time. On some days, certain things were best avoided, because they wouldn't have any effect anyway.</p><br><p>Eventually, Adam fell asleep on Jena's lap while the sun slowly rose from the horizon.</p><br><p>"Well, well... Burst into my house, left me unsatisfied, and now I'm going to have to pump myself full of coffee all day to keep myself awake. Agh, it was definitely worth it. After all, it's moments like that are what make the difference between a partner and just a sex partner, isn't it?" Jena muttered before heading for the kitchen.</p><br><br><p>Adam woke up only a few hours later, covered with a carefully arranged blanket.</p><br><p>On the table was a cup of already cold coffee and a note tucked under a plate filled with chocolate chip cookies.</p><br><p>Adam, drowsy, took the note, ran his eyes over it, and unknowingly a smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"Hah, looks like next time I'll need to bring more than a few chocolates and a soda, right?" Adam muttered, folding the note and taking a sip of coffee.</p><br><p>Jena wasn't here, so Adam couldn't thank her enough for making him feel so much better.</p><br><p>After every hard moment, one needed a reset, to throw the weight off his shoulders, to cast off the shackles. The marks remain, they make one stronger, but the heaviness is gone - only the desire to move on.</p><br><p>"Alright, stop thinking about it. You can't bring back the past, you can't see the future, but the present is quite possible to change!"</p><br><p>With these words, Adam left Jena's apartment and contacted Silvana.</p><br><p>An hour later, they were already in Second Ring, because here was the home of one of the strongest people in the entire Citadel. Some Second Rank Phantoms lived in the First Ring. It was the center of luxury and the city's infrastructure.</p><br><p>However, many chose the quieter option. The Second Ring, unlike the First Ring, had enough space for massive houses - actual cottages.</p><br><p>"Damn... Damien certainly isn't a modest person, is he?" Adam said, looking at the three-story house in front of him.</p><br><p>In fact, many even ordinary people, especially politicians and businessmen had bigger houses, but this place had a special aura about it.</p><br><p>Everything around, from the landscape to the other buildings, seemed to be trying to show that this particular house was the main one. It seemed that even the sun shone more often here.</p><br><p>"Let's go. Beth told us to come in when we arrived." Silvana said quietly, waiting for Adam to make the first move. </p><br><br><p>The main doors opened as Adam and Silvana entered the hall.</p><br><p>The first person they saw was Beth, she was at Damien's house today, and she had a clear purpose for this.</p><br><p>"Yes! Another one down! Do you think you can beat me?! I'll show you all!" Beth exclaimed, playing some kind of VR headset game.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana looked at each other.</p><br><p>They didn't know what to expect from Beth, but certainly not this.</p><br><p>"Agh...? I was killed...? No. How did that happen!" Beth exclaimed irritably. She obviously wouldn't be able to continue playing anytime soon.</p><br><p>Then, Beth took off her VR headset, sighed heavily, and turned around.</p><br><p>At the sight of Adam and Silvana, her eyes went slightly wide.</p><br><p>Beth, had shoulder-length brown hair, green eyes, and a calm, arrogant look.</p><br><p>"Oh, so you're already here. That's good." Beth muttered, pulled out her phone, and sent Damien a few messages.</p><br><p>A short time later, Damien appeared on the second floor, moving toward the stairs to say hello to them. However... his appearance was not at all appropriate. Well, that's what everyone but him would have thought.</p><br><p>Droplets dripped from the ends of his thick black hair, for he had only been out of the shower, as he wore nothing but a towel covering the area below his waist. His green eyes were filled with desire for life, enthusiasm, and curiosity, as well as boundless self-confidence and pride.</p><br><p>Moreover, two girls in their underwear were walking beside him. They clearly wanted Damien to return to the bedroom rather than leave them.</p><br><p>"Well, well, look who is here." Damien uttered with an excited expression.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes were wide open, and his jaw might have dropped to the floor. Silvana was surprised too, but not so much, for she knew of Damien's chaotic behavior. However, this was his home, and he could do what he wanted.</p><br><p>Beth's face hadn't changed at all. She wasn't his girlfriend like a relationship between Operator and Phantom should be. Over the years of working together, she had gotten used to it.</p><br><p>Then, he stopped and pulled the girl's hands away from him with obvious arrogance in his movements.</p><br><p>"That's it for today. Go back home."</p><br><p>"But... Weren't you ready for another round...?" One of the girls asked in a worried voice.</p><br><p>"Shut up. Just do as I said, and that's it because something more interesting is waiting for me now! Beth, am I saying this right?!" Damien exclaimed, clenching his fist.</p><br><br><p>"Quite possibly, but I'd still recommend you get dressed first. We have guests, after all."</p><br><p>Damien looked at the towel, then at Adam and Silvana, and nodded slightly.</p><br><p>In a few minutes they were sitting at the table, and now everyone was dressed, including Damien. He was wearing a red leather jacket and tight black pants as well as two dark bracelets.</p><br><p>"Beth briefed me on what happened with Travelers Squad and what you want to know about Ruby Dew. However, are you sure you want to get involved in this?" Damien asked with a slight smirk on his face.</p><br><p>Adam was about to answer, but Damien beat him to it, interrupting him.</p><br><p>"Because if you go to the Lower Ring right now with a charge against Ruby Dew, you'll be chopped into meat cubes before you can blink an eye."</p>
