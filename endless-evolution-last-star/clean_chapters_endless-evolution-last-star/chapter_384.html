            <br><p>The blue barrier disappeared, allowing Adam and everyone else to enter XH-01. There wasn't much room in this fighter, but considering they didn't have any major prey besides Plague Reaper, it was more than enough.</p><br><p>Taking advantage of the moment Katrin sat down in the pilot's seat. She didn't know how to operate a fighter, especially an XH-01, but she just wanted to enjoy the view from the best and only seat.</p><br><p>Osana rolled her eyes watching this and stepped aside, standing against the wall. She crossed her arms over her chest, waiting for them to fly off.</p><br><p>Adam though... He put Nessa to the side and sat down on the ground next to Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>XH-01 trembled violently as the azure liquid began to rapidly drain from the tanks, keeping the reserve at 30%.</p><br><p>Osana and Katrin watched the process with curiosity. They didn't know what XH-01 was capable of, but they knew it was something unique that the other Phantoms hadn't seen yet.</p><br><p>It was a rare opportunity not to be missed, but Adam didn't even look at it. His eyes were fixed on the floor, completely immersed in his thoughts.</p><br><p>The azure barrier reappeared around XH-01, all engines started and the fighter took off sharply, quickly reaching its sustained speed.</p><br><p>"Whoah... That's impressive..." Katrin muttered, flying over the area around Fume Cathedral, which was part of the Fallen Crypt.</p><br><p>Soon, Katrin noticed many winged monsters buried in the ground. It didn't take her much time to realize that the Plague Reaper's black air was responsible for this.</p><br><p>But... something was different from when these monsters had been seen by Nessa earlier. Some of them were gone, some had their paws torn off, and some were being devoured by scavengers right now.</p><br><p>In the monster world, no one would bury their fallen kin like in the Citadel. Monsters dead at the hands of one monster simply become a food source for other monsters, a pure biological chain devoid of morality.</p><br><br><p>Cutting through the wind currents with its sharp tip, XH-01 moved swiftly towards the Citadel. Katrin watched the areas below change rapidly due to the speed, while Osana looked curiously at the tanks with blue liquid and mechanical pipes.</p><br><p>Adam wasn't interested in either of these things, or rather he just didn't think about it. He didn't notice how he entered a strange state where he just wanted to stay in one place, waiting for his return home.</p><br><p>Unconsciously, Adam closed his eyes immersing himself in his inner space, but there his eyes were closed too.</p><br><p>The vast darkness thickened and the glow from the Evolution Tree grew a little brighter, quick flashes of light occasionally running through the Evolution Tree like a pulse.</p><br><p>His Evolution Tree was absorbing the experience and emotions that Adam had gone through that day. The memories of the battles, the losses, and the vivid pain along with the devastating victory would become one of the pillars of his strength that he could rely on in a difficult situation.</p><br><p>Then, an exceptionally faint aura began to emanate from Adam, completely unnoticeable. Katrin and Osana wouldn't be able to sense it even if they were standing right in front of Adam.</p><br><p>This aura wasn't related to his The Will or Spirit, as it wasn't really an aura. It was a light energy covering his body, protecting him like a veil while his consciousness was immersed in sleep and Evolution Tree was absorbing information from memories, gaining valuable experience.</p><br><p>Strangely enough... a similar field of energy was around Plague Reaper's body.</p><br><p>If there was someone truly strong in that fighter, someone, like Damien, then he could discern black particles of energy emanating from Plague Reaper that were hundreds of times smaller than dust grains.</p><br><p>The most appropriate word to describe it would be - radiant.</p><br><p>Like from some radioactive object. It wasn't an aura that was an indication of the creature's power, it was something more natural and much more deep...</p><br><p>Sure, Plague Reaper was already dead, but it had happened not long ago and his body still retained its former power.</p><br><p>Soon enough, the two fields, Adam's and Plague Reaper's, came into contact with each other.</p><br><p>Then, Adam opened his eyes, but in front of him, he saw neither Osana with Katrin nor Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>Instead, he was looking at Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>"What...? What's going on...?" Adam muttered, as his eyes went wide in confusion.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Adam didn't hear his own voice.</p><br><p>Step. Explore more adventures at empire</p><br><p>Plague Reaper stepped forward and his step echoed around him. Adam heard it clearly as if it were the most important sound on which his survival depended.</p><br><p>Before he could realize what was happening here, Plague Reaper appeared before him in his majestic form.</p><br><p>His gaze was calm, his black coat intact and menacing, and there were no wounds on his pale skin. It was the perfect fighter.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes reflected the Plague Reaper's fist that a second later slammed into his face, blasting his head.</p><br><br><p>Adam's body shuddered slightly, but neither Katrin nor Osana paid attention. Even if they stared at him, they didn't think it was anything important.</p><br><p>Then, Adam opened his eyes again, Plague Reaper was standing in the same place and there was no blood on his fist, though there should be.</p><br><p>"This... this is weird... why... no, how is this happening and what is it for?" Adam gulped.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper came into motion and after a few seconds Adam winced again and his body shuddered.</p><br><p>This continued over and over again, and each time their fight came to an end, a new impulse went through Evolution Tree since it was a new memory to gain valuable experience.</p><br><p>Adam lost track of time and any other sensation than slight pain. He didn't know how he was going to get out of this trap, not that he made any attempts.</p><br><p>He just kept fighting against Plague Reaper 1 vs. 1, eventually realizing one simple thing:</p><br><p>"Fuck... I'm weak..." Adam said after losing his forty-seventh fight in a row, without a single win.</p>
