            <br><p>"What? You're going to help me?" Reinz couldn't believe what he was hearing.</p><br><p>A few days ago he had been waiting for a worthy opponent to appear at the Twilight Palace, then when Adam appeared, he was sure it would be an easy victory.</p><br><p>He was wrong and he admitted it.</p><br><p>But... his pride wasn't going anywhere.</p><br><p>Accepting help from Adam, from someone who was his equal and was at the same stage?</p><br><p>It was nothing short of humiliating.</p><br><p>"Yeah." Adam nodded, "You see... Even though I hardly know you, I'm pretty sure something happened to you in the last three days.</p><br><p>"No... It happened even earlier. Right after you were defeated, right?"</p><br><p>Reinz bit his lip almost to the point of bleeding. Defeats were an unfamiliar occurrence for him, especially against a commoner at the Twilight Palace.</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam nodded deeply, his dark eyes absorbing Reinz, "Broken because of just one defeat?"</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam found himself in front of Reinz. A sword filled with his energy cleaved Reinz's chest in a wide sweep.</p><br><p>Following his instincts, Reinz quickly counterattacked.</p><br><br><br><p>His sword crashed into Adam's shoulder, unable to even cut Adam's shirt.</p><br><p>Julia's eyes went wide for a moment.</p><br><p>'Oh, I thought he was just going to block the sword with his body. After all, unless Reinz is using the Outer Energy Control, a steel blade can't hurt a K3-Phantom, but...' she licked her lips, 'That guy channeled energy to his clothes. Good, very good.'</p><br><p>Slash. Slash. Slash.</p><br><p>Reinz swung his sword a few more times trying to do some damage to Adam.</p><br><p>Then, Adam raised his hand, two fingers stopping Reinz's sword.</p><br><p>Sure, Reinz could have applied more force and the blade would have traveled farther, but without energy, it couldn't cut Adam's skin.</p><br><p>"Why...?" Reinz muttered, "What do you want to do? Humiliate me?!"</p><br><br><p>Adam let go of his sword.</p><br><br><p>Without warning, Adam swung his sword, leaving a long but shallow cut on Reinz's right leg, drops of blood flying off to the side along with pieces of fabric from Reinz's clothing.</p><br><p>"I spent a long time at Heaven Island. When I returned I wanted to get a decent fight, the other nobles weren't capable of giving me that, but... you did."</p><br><br><p>The steel sword slammed into Adam's side, yet was still the same useless piece of trash without Reinz's energy.</p><br><p>"I enjoyed our fight. It reminded me of my last battle against the Crimson Monarch. But, what do I see now?" Adam tilted his head, "My opponent who I thought was worthy, a talent from the first great family can't master the Outer Energy Control?</p><br><br><p>"SHUT UP!" Reinz exclaimed, a great grimace on his face, "Three days? I don't believe it's possible! It originally took a month to master Energy Control! How can I do the same thing in ten times less time?"</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, his blue eyes reflected in Reinz's crystal clear ones.</p><br><p>"You'll either do it, or you'll find yourself unworthy to be my opponent."</p><br><p>Then, several dark lines crashed down on Reinz's as the blade sliced through his chest.</p><br><p>Blood fell on Adam's cold face, who wasn't going to stop until he achieved his goal.</p><br><p>"Come on. I've been losing too. You can trust me - you get a lot more out of losing than you do from an endless string of victories."</p><br><br><p>At the same time, in another part of Erik's mansion, three silhouettes were doing their training.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, they were doing the same thing.</p><br><br><p>Silvana's and Chloe's fists slammed into Erik's chest who stood motionless in one place like a statue, immovable and invulnerable.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."</p><br><p>The heavy breathing of the two girls filled the spacious room. They had been doing this for the second day, but Erik still hadn't explained why.</p><br><p>"Mr. Erik..." Chloe gulped, not wanting to sound rude, "I don't want to do this anymore... I don't understand why we have to hit you?"</p><br><p>Erik shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><br><p>Shaking her head, Chloe was about to rush forward, but Silvana stopped her with a wave of her hand.</p><br><p>"No, Chloe's right. At first, I thought you were going to teach us how to fight, even though you told Adam and Reinz earlier that you wouldn't, but..." Silvana looked at her hands, "Even if that is your goal. We won't learn to fight this way. We just punch you in the chest, getting bruises since to us it's like hitting a steel wall."</p><br><p>Silvana crossed her arms over her chest, her gaze stern.</p><br><p>"We're not doing anything else without an explanation. While Adam and Reinz are getting stronger, we're wasting our time on something we don't understand."</p><br><p>Chloe trembled slightly, she wasn't as brave as Silvana to be rude to Erik, yet she agreed with her.</p><br><p>"Yes... I think so too!" she nodded uncertainly.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, all they saw in response was a sly smile.</p><br><p>"Well, well, it's been two days and only now you decide to ask questions? However, I've already accomplished something, though you haven't realized it yet."</p><br><p>Erik waved his hand, preparing to explain everything to them.</p><br><p>"You still don't realize it, but back from K2-Level, you have mastered energy. Sure, you don't need to know how to fight, your Phantoms can always protect you, and... not that the Operators have a reason to go to the Dead Lands. But... You have abilities, don't you?"</p><br><p>Silvana and Chloe exchanged glances. They knew what Erik was talking about, it all started with the Evolution Seed that had grown into Evolution Sprout.</p><br><p>"You can use your Phantoms' energy to enter combat mode and become a bit stronger. So, use it like you did for two days straight. Think of it as your version of the Energy Control."</p><br><p>A gleam passed across Erik's eyes as he looked intently at the two Operators.</p><br><p>"You see... How well you control your energy determines the effectiveness of your other abilities. Even now, you can affect how long you and your Phantom can maintain the Stellar Resonance.</p><br><br><p>"Julia possesses far more impressive abilities and you should learn how to use your powers now. After all, many secrets are waiting for you on K4."</p>
