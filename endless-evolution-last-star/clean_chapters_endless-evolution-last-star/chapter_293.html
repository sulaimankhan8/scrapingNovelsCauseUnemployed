            <br><p>Adam touched his earbud about to ask Silvana something, but she beat him to it, knowing what he was going to ask. Not because she wanted to show how she could anticipate his thoughts, but because she didn't want the Golden Light squad to hear his question.</p><br><p>'Igno Ant King is indeed a dangerous monster, not enough to become a disaster and turn this place into hell immediately after birth, but still extremely hazardous. If you want your and Katrin's hunt for Scarlet Pyromancer to be successful, I would advise you to help them.'</p><br><br><p>'However, not for free. Have them pay you 35%. Don't settle for less. Press your authority, after all, you are the strongest among them, and... Katrin is also a more than capable Phantom, don't forget that.'</p><br><p>Oskar wanted to say something in addition to his fiery speech, but he stopped, for Adam's look had changed dramatically. Silvana's instruction helped him decide how to proceed.</p><br><br><p>Adam jumped off Giant Rogo's head and slowly approached Oskar, leaving a footprint on the ashes.</p><br><p>Oskar was not only big and muscular but also tall. His height was over two meters tall, so Oskar looked down on Adam from top to bottom. However, he didn't feel in charge at all.</p><br><p>"40% of your reward for destroying the Igno Ants Nest and we'll help you." Adam said seriously, looking serenely at Oskar.</p><br><p>"Although..." Adam muttered not letting Oskar speak, "I'll have to ask her consent first."</p><br><p>Adam turned to Katrin, showing that her word mattered more to him than Oskar's decision.</p><br><p>Katrin waved her hand.</p><br><p>"Well, it won't be good if, during the hunt for Scarlet Pyromancer, we get attacked by the Igno Ant King because they can't handle it."</p><br><p>Erla, Lero, and Osana frowned at her arrogant statement but didn't say anything. In any case, it was Oskar who had the last word and decision.</p><br><p>Oskar sighed heavily, scratched the back of his head with a frown, and said:</p><br><p>"Fine! There are four of us, two of you, so 40% will be quite fair considering we get help from you personally. But!" Oskar exclaimed, pointing at Adam, poking him in the chest, "For that extra 7%, I demand that you obey me as your leader!"</p><br><br><p>"Sure, just tell me everything in detail again."</p><br><p>So they all headed towards Igno Ants Nest, which was getting smaller and smaller as the Giant Rogoes were slowly burning it down.</p><br><p>Oskar was talking about 7% because there were six of them. So if they were to split the reward equally, they should each get 16.6%, so Adam and Katrin should only be asking for 33%.</p><br><br><br><p>Oskar swung his massive sword, chopping up several ants in his path.</p><br><p>"Watch out!" Lero exclaimed as an ant appeared behind Oskar, about to sink its powerful jaws into his back.</p><br><br><p>Katrin's staff came crashing down on the ant's head, nailing it to the ground. Before the ant could regain consciousness she brought the staff down once more, blasting the ant's head into chunks.</p><br><br><p>In his mind Katrin was Adam's support, he didn't understand how she could be so bloodthirsty and cruel.</p><br><p>"Basically, we have to destroy not only the Igno Ants but anyone who wants their resources. There's a small chance that by using the resources prepared for the king, some monster will be able to evolve." Oskar uttered, leaning on his sword for a brief rest.</p><br><p>Adam nodded, looking around.</p><br><p>They had made a deal thirty minutes ago, and in that time they had destroyed all the monsters, all the ants on the east side.</p><br><p>In the beginning, when the Igno Ants had brought him and Katrin here, he had thought that soon the Igno Ants would lose, but that hadn't happened so far.</p><br><p>The Igno Ants, up to now, had successfully defended the north, south, and west sides of their Nest against the Giant Rogoes.</p><br><p>Moreover, ten minutes ago, near the Giant Rogoes, Horned Red Lizards, Purple Threat Level monsters, and White Book began to appear. They weren't as strong as Giant Rogoes, but they still ranked Top-88 among all Purple Threat Monsters and were stronger than the ants.</p><br><p>Red Lizards had long horns on their heads, two narrow amber eyes, and elongated jaws with long tongues. They had a tough black hide covered in protective plates and thick red veins running through their thick tails, conducting dense flames.</p><br><p>However, they had not yet engaged in battle. They ran between the Giant Rogoes' legs before disappearing into the ash, like in sand. The Red Lizards were waiting for their time, they didn't want to rush. Their goal was to sneak into the Igno Ants and take their resources.</p><br><p>"Yeah, but it seems like there wasn't a strong need for our intervention. There are more and more different monsters appearing here every minute." Adam muttered, raising his gaze upwards.</p><br><p>For some time now, a multitude of black birds with broad wings and sharp red beaks had been hovering over the area. They were slowly planning, watching the surroundings intently with their four eyes positioned at their sides.</p><br><p>These were the Dark Loohoes. Besides their beaks, each Dark Looho had a deadly weapon - their claws that could burst into flames at will. Not only were the claws sharp enough to tear Red Lizards apart, but they were also hot.</p><br><p>An ordinary Dark Looho was rated as a Top-66. Given that they were gradually growing in number, they posed a danger to anyone under their broad wings.</p><br><br><p>Oskar smirked, shaking his head.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Did I say something wrong?" Adam tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>"Well, you think the Igno Ants are losing, don't you? I hate to disappoint you, but Igno Ants aren't stupid monsters. They work like a well-coordinated machine, so they were prepared to be attacked by everyone around them."</p><br><p>Then, Oskar pointed to the northern passage - the one closest to where they were and the most damaged.</p><br><p>Three Giant Rogoes were standing in front of the northern passageway and many long horns were visible from under the ash near their feet. The Red Lizards were ready to break into the anthill as well.</p><br><br><p>Several dark flashes flew out of the holes of the northern side, using their massive mirrored wings to achieve lightning speed.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, five shadows pierced Giant Rogo's head, blasting it apart. Then, they rose high up looking at the defeated enemy and anyone who dared to attack their Nest before the king was born.</p><br><p>These were the Igno Ant Guards - the main defenders of the Nest</p>
