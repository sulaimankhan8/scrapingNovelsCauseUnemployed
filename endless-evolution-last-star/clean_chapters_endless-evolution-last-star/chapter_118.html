            <br><br><p>Adam and Alexia fell to the ground, crawling up and leaning on each other's backs with their last strength. They were breathing heavily, just staring into the void and occasionally at the North Keeper torn into three pieces.</p><br><p>"You know... We make a pretty good duo." Alexia interrupted with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>They were gradually exiting Resonance, their mission was accomplished. Moreover, Owen's buff had ended as well, so... it was unlikely that they would be able to at least get back on their feet anytime soon.</p><br><p>"Yeah... That wasn't bad. It's a bit of a shame I couldn't beat 4th Rank by myself, but... I couldn't have done it without you." Adam sighed heavily.</p><br><p>After a short pause, Alexia coughed and asked:</p><br><p>"Adam... The two of us fought, but the genes and, most importantly, the Power Gene, only one of us will be able to get..."</p><br><p>Alexia was not ready to demand Adam to give up something so valuable. She had to make it fair, after all, they had both put effort into winning.</p><br><p>"Take it." Adam waved his hand nonchalantly, "I already have enough genes for whatever I need. After all, I've killed three Prime Azure Wolves."</p><br><p>"But... Power Gene isn't just simple genes used as a resource for growth. Power Gene will actually make you stronger." Alexia muttered.</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Meh. I already have Power Gene. North Keeper was definitely stronger than the Crown Monster I killed, but I don't think I'll be able to use that gene, unlike you. You use ice, don't you?"</p><br><br><p>"Sure. I already have a Power Gene, but this one is much stronger and more suitable for me. Thank you. I'll be sure to pay you back, someday."</p><br><p>Adam didn't answer anything, he just glanced at the battlefield. In a few minutes dawn was about to break, as the moon, covered by a dark sphere, was almost disappearing over the horizon. With a little more time left, Adam's first Eclipse would be finished.</p><br><p>"It's a shame it had to happen like this..." Adam whispered, staring at the dead young man with a massive hole in his chest from Alexia's blow.</p><br><p>Alexia glanced at Adam with a hard stare.</p><br><p>"You think I'm a monster?"</p><br><p>Adam shook his head as he looked up at the faintly dark sky, changing to a light layer from the approaching dawn.</p><br><p>"If this had happened at the beginning of my journey, I would have hated you. However... He, as well as the others, had ample opportunity to escape, moreover, Ester and the Operators told them too. I won't say I think it's normal, but I realize that sometimes there's no choice."</p><br><p>Alexia didn't answer anything. She just nodded with a deep look. During the Resonance, her emotions had been affected as well, now she was rethinking everything that had happened.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, came a tremendous pressure that made the Phantoms forget how to breathe. Then, ten meters in front of Adam and Alexia, a huge creature over six meters tall appeared from the ground.</p><br><p>The monster's body, like that of an evil spirit, started from a single point, gradually growing wider and wider at the top, with thick flesh and iron plates here and there. The monster had two long paws, no legs as it hovered above the ground, and a massive, horrible jaw with protruding teeth.</p><br><p>At that moment, all sounds of imminent death disappeared, for every Phantom instantly realized that this monster was higher than Purple Threat Level, significantly!</p><br><p>Neither Adam, Alexia, nor anyone else in their squad was able to hurt this monster that appeared at the very end of Eclipse.</p><br><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam's eyes went wide as a man appeared between them and the monster, standing with his back to the monster.</p><br><p>The man had thick black hair, dark eyes, and a serene expression. A long black coat covered his muscular body with broad shoulders. Unlike the other Phantoms wearing winter clothes, he wore what he wanted rather than what was necessary.</p><br><p>"Hey, looks like you've run into some unexpected problems, haven't you?" The man waved his hand with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>" Watch out!" Adam exclaimed as the monster extended its paw towards the man.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the monster's claws reached the man, touching his shoulder. A sharp glint traveled down the claws, about to tear the man apart.</p><br><p>However... the man simply stepped forward, keeping his hands in his pockets as if he were out for a walk.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the monster's body began to swell as if from a ghastly infection bloating the flesh before exploding, leaving behind only a few chunks of dark flesh.</p><br><p>"Oh, so you defeated North Keeper?" The man tilted his head, rubbing his chin thoughtfully and looking at the monster's corpse.</p><br><p>The man nodded a few times.</p><br><p>"Not bad, not bad. I was hoping the two of you would prove yourselves in this Eclipse, and I wasn't wrong. Adam, for your information, you took quite a risk while going through Elemental Circle. I wouldn't advise you to do that again." The man carelessly said.</p><br><p>'Who is he...?' Adam inwardly muttered.</p><br><p>Silvana, as if reading his thoughts said:</p><br><p>'This is Erden Hage, Guardian of the Bastion Radon. He is the strongest Phantom of this Bastion and the nearby region. Apparently, he has been keeping an eye on all the squads during the Eclipse... To help in emergencies.' Silvana said quickly.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes filled with realization, and Erden saw it.</p><br><p>"Alright. Your work is done, as is mine. Thank you for helping to protect my Bastion. Come back if you wish." Erden said calmly before stepping and disappearing right in front of Adam's and Alexia's eyes.</p><br><p>Adam and Alexia looked over to each other, smiled slightly, and... passed out, colliding foreheads.</p><br><br><p>The Eclipse was over. The first rays of sunlight were the most welcome thing for every Phantom. None of them had ever before, wished to see sunlight so much.</p><br><p>Many died, many more were wounded, but... they had accomplished their mission. Thousands of monsters were killed, and millions of Bastion residents could wake up with peace of mind, just like any other day.</p><br><p>Sure, not all citizens understood what the Phantoms had to go through during Eclipse, but... to those closer to the Phantoms, it was more than obvious.</p><br><p>All the gates of the bastion opened as hundreds of trucks and helicopters flew to the aid. The military and doctors had to give the Phantoms urgent medical treatment, and the Harvesters had to begin their direct duties.</p><br><p>They had to cut the monsters into pieces, as there was plenty of material.</p><br><p>Each Eclipse was as much a tragedy as it was a celebration. In a single night, Citadel and Bastions would get as much material from monsters as from hundreds of missions, though more likely even much more.</p><br><p>Sure, some monsters were too badly damaged to be useful, but only a small fraction.</p><br><br><p>Erden ate a piece of chocolate bar while standing on the north wall. His gaze traveled to Adam and Alexia, who were being carried away on a stretcher to the helicopter, then to the other Phantoms.</p><br><p>"Is it just me, or were there too many monsters this time?" Clara, standing next to him, muttered with a hard look.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah... It's not even the quantity, but the quality. I can't remember the last time K1-Squad was attacked by Top-5 monsters."</p><br><p>Erden continued with a sharp look.</p><br><p>"Well, perhaps that's why the Eclipses have become less frequent. We have to prepare better, or there will only be more casualties."</p>
