            <br><p>Each statue needed a key, or rather a weapon to activate. There were three weapons in total, a spear, a hammer, and a sword.</p><br><br><p>After a few steps, Adam stopped in front of the ice blade, feeling the intense cold, though he hadn't even picked it up yet.</p><br><p>"Well, let's see what kind of weapon Blind Commander was fighting with."</p><br><p>Adam bent down before gripping the sword firmly by the hilt, reflecting on the past fight.</p><br><p>'Damn... I don't even know how to describe the feeling, but somehow I feel like if Blind Commander was on a higher level, not a typical Crown Monster, he'd be just as intimidating as the Plague Reaper. Well, considering they have different Threat Levels.'</p><br><br><p>A refreshing chill ran along Adam's arm, soon spreading throughout his entire body. He turned towards the stream of blue flames, but that was not where he needed to go.</p><br><p>The ice sword shuddered, its edges glowing brightly before shattering into tiny frosty shards hovering around Adam like crystals.</p><br><p>His eyes grew wide, watching them like a child seeing snow for the first time in his life.</p><br><p>'Wow... It's really beautiful... Hah, it's also ironic that the beauty only appeared after all the blood and pain we both went through...'</p><br><p>A few seconds later, after making a few turns around Adam, the shards shuddered in a single stream heading towards his left arm.</p><br><p>Very quickly they turned into a tiny ice cross, held together by two chains tightly bound around Adam's hand and wrist.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>"Hmm? A cross? But... why?"</p><br><p>Then, into his mind appeared the Mighty Commander and his heavy stone bracelets.</p><br><p>"Well, in that case, it makes sense. These three weapons in this fortress are very different being in their compressed form."</p><br><p>He knew what he had to do next - go down to the lowest point through the path he knew and give the third statue the last weapon.</p><br><p>Yet, Adam noticed something strange, his eyes traveled lower to his right arm.</p><br><p>"Hmm? That certainly hasn't happened before..."</p><br><p>The handle of the ice sword was still in his tight grip, it had lost its blade and was no longer a complete weapon, but it was still one piece.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, several waves of blue energy from the cross traveled through his body, the chains shaking slightly trying to restore Adam's strength as quickly as possible. He was rewarded for defeating the last Commander in the fortress.</p><br><p>"Hey, do you think I should take it with me?" Adam asked, addressing the only one who could hear him right now.</p><br><p>He soon got his answer:</p><br><p>'I'm sure you won't need it to activate the statue, if the hilt hasn't changed its shape, then it's not under the influence of the External Artifact.'</p><br><br><p>'However, if I were you, I would destroy it just in case.'</p><br><p>"Destroy it...? Hah, I have a better idea."</p><br><p>With a slight smile on his face, Adam set the hilt of the ice sword aside, carefully laying it down next to the slab.</p><br><p>'Wait... Adam, what are you doing?' Silvana was baffled.</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Well, I'm sure pretty soon I'll have to get out of here, and I'll summon a fighter jet right here. The External Artifact will let us go as well as the monsters. Then I'll take this hilt and add it to my collection."</p><br><p>Silvana puffed up her cheeks unhappily as she crossed her arms over her chest.</p><br><p>'Pffft, I won't let you risk the pilot's life for your convenience. Nothing will happen to you if you leave the fortress first.'</p><br><p>"Hah, why are you suddenly being so hard on me? Instead of arguing let's enjoy the beautiful view together since we're seeing the same thing."</p><br><br><p>With those words, Adam walked to the edge of the platform, resting his hand on the nearest pillar.</p><br><p>It was the same spot he sat next to Blind Commander, watching the sun go down.</p><br><p>"Hah... There hasn't been a trace of the sun's light left during our battle, however... it should be different on the other side, shouldn't it?"</p><br><p>Adam turned around, eager to see the first edges of the rising moon, as well as the bright light that was to illuminate this night's dark lands, just as it always did before.</p><br><br><br><p>Two delicate hands turned sharply to the side, the bright light from the shimmering crystals making the pale skin even whiter.</p><br><p>A loud crunch spread away as the large creature remotely resembling a lizard collapsed to the ground. Its bright, pink eyes quickly lost their light as did the hundreds of small crystals covering most of its body.</p><br><p>The silhouette moved on down the narrow passageway, not stopping at its next victim who wasn't even worthy to die from its real weapon.</p><br><p>The shadow had a purpose, and the genes of another monster were not part of its plans.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, another lizard hiding behind massive crystals pounced on Phantom, intending to use the first attack to end the fight at once.</p><br><br><p>Before the lizard could touch the silhouette with its long paws, the broad blade of an unusual, straight black sword swept across its neck, separating its head from its body.</p><br><p>Then, in complete silence, the silhouette continued to move on, emitting a frightening aura, at least for the frightened monsters hiding behind the crystals.</p><br><p>Soon, the figure stopped looking at a lone monster a hundred meters ahead, waiting for its opponent in the middle of a wide gorge.</p><br><p>Crystals filled everything around it, from the ground to the high edges, as if trying to reach the dark night sky, too dark.</p><br><p>"There you are... the reason why this mission is going to be one of my most dangerous..."</p><br><p>Katrin muttered watching her future opponent, who had only recently come out of a deep sleep. Stay updated through My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>She was here since this was a special night mission, her target - the Dormant Lord of Crystal Gorge, only came out at night, by the light of the moon.</p><br><br><p>Katrin stepped forward confidently, mentally preparing herself for such a titled opponent, until an anxious voice echoed in her mind:</p><br><p>'Katrin... Something's wrong... Look up...'</p><br><p>Alan's shaky voice confused Katrin, but she didn't ask too many questions and raised her head.</p><br><p>Then, her eyes went wide in horror.</p><br><p>The bright, blue moon - on this night it was a lie of which only a shining disk remained.</p><br><p>At that very minute, something that was not supposed to happen according to all the military and Operators' predictions began.</p><br><p>The Eclipse had begun.</p>
