            <br><br><p>Nervous, intermittent laughter slowly dispersed from the main venue in the entire Moon Colosseum.</p><br><p>Kogen tossed aside a packet of chips, it was unknown how many he had already eaten, as something finally happened that made him distract himself from the monotonous eating of snacks.</p><br><p>"HAHAHAHAHA! He actually did it! He just gobbles his arm like a monster!"</p><br><p>An exclamation filled in mild insanity with mixed delight spread around, his voice not loud enough for every spectator to hear it, but... soon everyone would be forced to feel the effects of Kogen's emotions.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A turquoise aura, like the uncontrollable flames of a wild beast, emerged from Kogen, in a heartbeat multiplying several times over.</p><br><p>And... unlike Gladius who had used his aura against Mariel, Zarot, and the others in the banquet hall, Kogen didn't care that there were those around him for whom even a fraction of his aura was deadly.</p><br><p>Terror coming from instincts filled Silvana and Arayna's faces, Elva, Liv, and Tilda were in the same situation, their eyes wide open.</p><br><p>Well... in fact, except Baren, who could with some difficulty withstand the pressure of Kogen's aura, everyone was already on edge, Franz, Osana, Nelya, and Rosalind included.</p><br><p>Kogen's aura wasn't directed at them, he didn't have any reason to want to hurt them, yet that didn't make the situation any easier. The hurricane of emotions within him was turning him into an erupting volcano with no enemies and no goals, but everything around it was destined to be destroyed under its great power.</p><br><p>Soon, they were about to reach their limit, and the aura would go beyond Kogen's box to unleash the same pressure on the other viewers.</p><br><p>But... fortunately for his innocent victims, there were some nearby who possessed enough power to at least limit the mad volcano.</p><br><br><p>At the snap of a finger, purple and crimson auras like two calm spheres emerged from Gladius and Erik, stopping the turquoise flames.</p><br><p>Osana, who saw this, breathed a sigh of relief.</p><br><p>'Phew, I didn't expect Kogen's aura to be so intimidating, but... if those two decided to act, then we have nothing else to worry about.'</p><br><br><p>Purple and crimson spheres exploded in several places, letting in turquoise flames that, like monster paws, tore apart everything in their path.</p><br><p>Read exclusive adventures at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Hahahahahahaha!" Kogen laughed again, echoing, "Come on! Finish him off! End your fight with a suitable attack! You managed to make this fight worthwhile towards the end! Don't ruin the finale!"</p><br><p>Osana's eyes went wide in horror, watching that even Gladius's and Erik's auras couldn't stop Kogen's, though he wasn't even controlling his aura, it was coming out without his knowledge driven by pure emotion from the fight.</p><br><p>Realizing that he needed to act, Baren gritted his teeth about to release his aura. He was sure he could help Gladius and Erik, even if only a little.</p><br><br><p>A simple wave of a hand stopped him.</p><br><p>"Oh, don't." Gladius smiled sweetly.</p><br><p>Then, his gaze traveled to the turquoise flames tearing his aura apart.</p><br><p>"I'm afraid if that wild beast touches your aura, things could end badly. Leave it to the adults, it's too early for you to deal with real monsters..."</p><br><p>At the same moment, as if on command, Gladius and Erik's auras intensified, switching to protect the weaker ones and restricting Kogen's aura from expanding beyond their box.</p><br><br><p>Erik put a hand on Tilda's shoulder, a slight smile on his face as if nothing terrible had happened.</p><br><br><p>"Yes... How strange..."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Erik raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><br><p>The spicy chip disappeared into Tilda's mouth with a distinct crunch.</p><br><p>"Kogen, he's very strong, just like you... But despite that, it's much more interesting to watch their fight."</p><br><p>Tilda pointed at Adam, who slowly raised his crimson sword, holding the hilt tightly with both hands.</p><br><p>"Hahaha! Because you're watching the flames in their eyes. The way these two overcome themselves for the sake of victory."</p><br><p>Then, Erik's joyful smile disappeared, and his face darkened.</p><br><p>"But, in battle, only one can win. For one to be a winner, there must be a loser, simple as that."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Thick crimson energy traveled down the thick chain and massive gauntlet, infusing the long sword with pure, bloodthirsty power.</p><br><br><p>Adam clenched his hands tightly around the hilt before taking one step forward and raising the sword high above his head.</p><br><p>Silvana, who had seen all the fights Adam had participated in, could well discern whose power it was like.</p><br><p>'Power Gene from Steel Knight, and it looks like Adam is using one of his abilities and... with the help of another creature's blood, no... with the help of another creature's energy he was able to restore some of his strength, it was very similar to...'</p><br><p>Silvana had two options, Essence Thunder Demon, and the Plague Reaper, she couldn't find out for sure, hardly even Adam had a clear answer, he was just doing what he was capable of.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Silvana stopped looking at Adam for the first time in a long period and shifted her gaze to Fromund, concern was evident in her deep green eyes.</p><br><p>'Can you survive this...?''</p><br><p>Cold, ominous vapor came out at Adam's sigh, he stared at his opponent.</p><br><p>"Fromund, this is my final attack, against you..."</p><br><p>The last words stunned Fromund, but he didn't have time to think, he quickly prepared for battle, thrusting his flaming spear in front of him.</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam swung his sword from bottom to top, bringing down on Fromund a massive crimson blade of thick, frightening energy cutting through everything in its path.</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Fromund's body, fear filled his eyes, and his legs trembled.</p><br><p>'No! I can't give up! If I survive this attack then victory will be mine! I must do it! For their sake... for the sake of Elva, Liv, and Tilda!'</p><br><br><p>Fromund swung his spear about to attack, but... before he could do anything, the crimson blade was already in front of him - slicing his weapon in two, bringing him nothing but cold defeat.</p><br><p>'No... This can't be, I can't lose... I've never lost to another one-on-one... This shouldn't be happening...'</p>
