            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1412: Speed Beyond Limits</strong></p><br><p>Everyone knew that the Phantoms’ strength lay in their wide range of abilities, some of which were complex and unique enough to completely turn the tide of battle in their favor.</p><br><p>Monsters, on the other hand, evolved much faster and more easily compared to the Phantoms, who constantly faced obstacles in their path. Also, the average monster was much stronger physically than a normal Phantom and had significantly more energy.</p><br><p>The Hybrids were the third party in this confrontation. For most of their journey, they evolved as monsters, but when they became the Hybrids, a lot changed.</p><br><p>Their instincts were their main asset and strongest point. No matter what path a monster or a Phantom had taken, none of them could compete with the instincts of even the most ordinary Hybrid.</p><br><p>Now, Adam had seen this for himself.</p><br><p>He could clearly see Anelez’s expression. From her gaze, he could tell that she hadn’t had time to react to his attack. She had realized what was happening too late.</p><br><br><p>Her body acted faster than her mind. Hah, that’s not what I was prepared for. Adam complained inwardly. What do you think about this?</p><br><p>Silvana joined him, mentally.</p><br><p>It’s definitely dangerous. Honestly, given the situation, I don’t think you can outsmart her or wait for the right moment to attack. As long as her body is physically capable of it, it will block or dodge any of your attacks.’</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly, while Anelez closed the distance with each confident step.</p><br><p>“Yes. I think so too. So I need to defeat her in a fair fight? Well, for starters, I need to at least understand how strong she is.”</p><br><p>For now, Adam decided not to use his abilities. He stared intently at Anelez, waiting for her next attack.</p><br><p>His energy ran through his body until white flames covered his hands and feet.</p><br><br><p>With a shudder, Anelez disappeared, leaving only a stream of dust rising from the ground in her spot.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened as he didn’t notice where Anelez had gone.</p><br><p>But… His instincts were well developed as well.</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, Adam turned as he grabbed Anelez’s wrist with such force as if his life depended on it.</p><br><p>That was not far from the truth.</p><br><p>A flash ran through Anelez’s claws, stopping right in front of his trembling pupils.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Adam’s heart was beating faster. He realized that if he had hesitated even for a split second, Anelez’s claws would have pierced his head. Maybe he would have survived and lost his eye, or maybe that would have been the end of it.</p><br><p>“You…” Anelez looked at Adam, her calm eyes reflecting his smirk. “You’re actually enjoying this, right?”</p><br><p>“Do you have a problem with that?” Adam tightened his grip on her handle, causing her skin to wrinkle.</p><br><p>Anelez shook her head. “No. We entered the Rule of Blood for different reasons, but we have the same goal. You want to become stronger, just like me. However, you are one of those who are used to making mistakes and overcoming them with your willpower.</p><br><br><p>She leaned in as her gray eyes deepened, obscuring the light.</p><br><p>“When I fight, I don’t forgive mistakes.”</p><br><br><p>“Hah, it doesn’t seem like it, because I—”</p><br><p>Anelez’s foot slammed into Adam’s jaw, distorting his face from the sheer force of the blow.</p><br><br><p>Like a cannonball, his body bounced several times off the ground before crashing into a lone rock in the distance.</p><br><p>Instead of continuing her successful series of attacks, Anelez looked around.</p><br><p>‘Excellent. This is a suitable place. I don’t know all of his abilities, but he won’t be able to get away from me here. In the worst case, he’ll have to sacrifice something.’</p><br><br><p>Adam threw the cobblestone aside, clearing his path.</p><br><p>He met Anelez’s gaze as a bright red flame flared from her feet.</p><br><p>“Hmm? What is she doing?” Adam raised an eyebrow. He thought Anelez had decided to use the Solar Form, but someone like her wouldn’t resort to her trump card without necessity.</p><br><p>For now, she was going to stick to the plan, and the first thing she wanted to do was wear Adam down with one of her abilities.</p><br><br><p>Anelez disappeared, but this time Adam could clearly see her movements. Anelez became a fiery flash that moved around him at tremendous speed, creating a ring of fire with Adam at its center next to the destroyed rock.</p><br><br><p>He stepped forward, looking for a way out.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Anelez changed her trajectory, rushing right in front of Adam to reach the other side of the circle.</p><br><p>Blood spurted out as Adam’s expression froze, staring at the dark red stain on the ground.</p><br><p>Three long cuts remained on his skin, hot as if from a blade coming out of a red-hot forge.</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could recover, Anelez repeated her attack, leaving a long cut on Adam’s back with the same intense pain as before.</p><br><p>She locked him inside a circle of flames, and Adam had no way to stop her.</p><br><p>‘Shit… She’s way faster than me. Even if I manage to react, she’ll just change her trajectory or put more power into her jump.’</p><br><p>Anelez continued to run, maintaining a high but steady speed so that Adam would have no opportunity to find a weak spot in her technique.</p><br><p>‘Great, a few more attacks and he’ll start to panic. I can’t seriously injure him this way, but every wound brings him closer to defeat. I have to use this.’</p><br><p>Narrowing her eyes, she prepared to attack again when something stopped her.</p><br><br><p>Adam smiled broadly, and his aura changed. His energy no longer covered his hands and feet as he stretched his arm forward.</p><br><p>“Alright, two hits is the most I can allow you to get.”</p><br><p>As if at his call, the Dual Demon Sword appeared in his grasp with a destructive thunder strike. An exoskeleton of blue lightning covered Adam’s body as two hollow wings unfolded on his back.</p><br><p>Then, before Anelez could comprehend the changes, Adam stepped forward and vanished.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, he was in front of her as his wings sought to pierce Anelez with their sharp tips, as did the dark sword.</p><br><p>“What now?” Adam asked with a smirk. “Will your instincts help you?!”</p>
