            <br><p>Though today had been a hard eventful day for Silvana and Adam, in reality only a few hours had passed most of which they had been walking around Iron Observatory.</p><br><p>Sure, they felt like a lot more time had passed. After all, they saw all of each other's memories and also participated in a long illusion created by the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>They were going to go home, reflect on what had happened, savor the success, and move on, but they weren't the only Operator and Phantom who were willing to go through Gene Diffusion.</p><br><p>Either way, it was a necessary requirement for anyone who wanted to reach K3-Level, it was becoming a unified desire for both Phantom and Operator.</p><br><br><p>A tall girl with shoulder-length gray hair and black eyes stepped out of the car, dressed in loose black clothes. There was nothing but confidence and determination in her gaze, especially after receiving the great treasure that became her power.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment, then the corners of his mouth lifted.</p><br><p>The girl took a few steps forward before realizing who stood before her, her face turning pale, confused.</p><br><p>"Wait... Adam and Silvana... What are you doing here...?"</p><br><p>Katrin's murmur only elicited a short laugh from Adam, surprised at their unexpected meeting.</p><br><p>"Well, well, looks like we got ahead of you, didn't we?"</p><br><p>Then, Adam stopped abruptly, realizing that Katrin was not alone, and... this was the first time he would get to not hear, but see Katrin's Operator - Alan.</p><br><br><p>A guy of average height, he was shorter than Katrin, walking slightly uncertainly behind her. Alan had a cute face and a smile filled with kindness, his freckles and spiky red hair cascading downward only emphasized those features.</p><br><p>But, the most notable feature was his eyes - two big bright emeralds. Adam hated to admit it, but Alan's eyes were more intense than Silvana's, like crystals capable of enchanting anyone with a single glimpse.</p><br><p>Alan was dressed very much like what Silvana saw in her illusion - a loose white shirt and very tight black pants, showing off his thin, skinny legs.</p><br><p>Realizing that Adam and Silvana were looking at him, Alan's eyes went wide as he quickly bowed low.</p><br><p>"Adam, Silvana! It's a pleasure to meet you! I'm Alan, Katrin's Operator! I hope we can be friends!" Alan said respectfully.</p><br><p>Adam's eyebrow twitched.</p><br><p>"What a... sweet greeting."</p><br><p>Enjoy exclusive chapters from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Silvana silently nodded a few times, in affirmation.</p><br><p>"Agh?!" Katrin frowned heavily, her mood changing instantly as she approached Adam.</p><br><br><p>She grabbed him sharply by the collar with a great frown.</p><br><p>"What did you say? Alan has a perfectly respectful greeting!" Katrin shouted while throwing a menacing glare at Silvana.</p><br><p>Alan flinched, he reached his hand forward and his lips quivered, he wanted to stop Katrin, but it was too late.</p><br><p>It was obvious that this was not the first time Alan was in this situation, Katrin had a problem with overprotection.</p><br><p>However, instead of irritation, there was only a slight smile on Adam's face as he nodded slowly and deeply.</p><br><p>"Good, from the looks of it you two have nothing to worry about."</p><br><p>Katrin narrowed her eyes, she knew what Adam was talking about. She let go of his collar, snorted irritably, and stepped back.</p><br><p>"I don't think the scientists would approve of this, but since we've met I just can't help but ask."</p><br><p>With a brief pause, biting her lip Katrin raised her gaze to Adam.</p><br><p>"The Gene Diffusion, what's it like? Should Alan and I be wary of anything?"</p><br><p>Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>"I'm not going to answer a question like that. Like I said, you have nothing to worry about, the most important thing is that you trust each other, but that's advice not for The Gene Diffusion, it's life one."</p><br><p>Realizing she was pushing too far Katrin nodded. Despite her confident expression, she was worried, since they already knew the risks.</p><br><p>Unlike Adam and Silvana, they had come here because they had arranged it in advance, so they had come to the Iron Observatory by themselves, without a scientist accompanying them.</p><br><p>"What do you plan to do next?" Katrin tilted her head.</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"I don't know, I'll probably just rest and head to the Dead Lands, I think it's time to destroy the First Wall, due to some events..."</p><br><p>Osana appeared in his mind with a sly smile on her face.</p><br><p>"I've been greatly delayed on this matter."</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Katrin's face changed, her eyes went wide filled with disbelief. What she had just heard in no way matched her expectations.</p><br><p>"W-Wait... It's been three months since... Since the fight against Plague Reaper and you still haven't destroyed your First Wall?"</p><br><p>Adam couldn't answer anything but sigh heavily, he didn't see it as a serious problem since he was going to do it on his next mission.</p><br><p>"Hahaha." Katrin laughed with a mocking smirk on his face, "Looks like you're no longer the Adam Vinter I knew."</p><br><p>"Katrin... you shouldn't say that..." Alan whispered, "It's rude..."</p><br><br><p>Katrin patted him on the back like an older sister.</p><br><p>"It's okay, Adam isn't the type to take offense at such a small thing, but..."</p><br><p>Her gaze grew colder as if trying to pierce Adam.</p><br><p>"I'm disappointed. In these three months, I've destroyed my First Wall and completed dozens of difficult missions. Has all this time been all about you just resting and idling?"</p><br><p>Silvana was indignant, but before she could say anything, Adam took her hand and swept forward with her like a free-flowing wind.</p><br><p>The calm smile on his face for some reason sent a chill down Katrin's spine, a feeling that only appeared when she faced beings superior to her.</p><br><p>'No... he's weaker than me right now. I can feel it in his aura. He hasn't even broken the First Wall yet, he's a W0 and I'm a W1.'</p><br><p>After a few steps, Adam stopped, turning to a shocked Katrin.</p><br><p>"Hey, Katrin, I have a question for you."</p><br><p>"Agh...? What do you want to know?"</p><br><p>Adam lifted his chin high, his eyes narrowed with a proud glint.</p><br><p>"In these three months... How many tough fights have you had? No... not that one."</p><br><p>His lips slowly came into motion:</p><br><p>"How many worthy opponents have you faced on the level of the Plague Reaper? Because I had one of those and I won. My best fight in a long time."</p><br><p>Katrin wanted to sharply reply something, but stopped in mid-sentence her face quickly turned pale. She realized she didn't have an answer to his question.</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand, walking away along the road.</p><br><p>"Good luck, hopefully you'll have some serious opponents soon. What's the point of having powers if there isn't someone who can withstand all your might?"</p>
