            <br><p>Adam and Katrin looked at each other. As experienced fighters, they expected the Crimson Monarch to have some trump card, but... a trident from the snake's mouth?</p><br><p>That was not what any of them were thinking.</p><br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch stepped forward confidently, his stride causing Adam and Katrin to pull back. They didn't know what his trident was capable of, but they realized that the trump card of such a powerful creature was no ordinary thing.</p><br><p>For a while, the Crimson Monarch stared at Adam, in silence. He said nothing, recognizing in Adam's eyes only the willingness to fight, no matter how hard.</p><br><p>Then Crimson Monarch nodded deeply, before slowly turning to Katrin's side. Her condition was much worse, yet she wasn't thinking about losing.</p><br><p>Right now, if Katrin fought to the last drop of blood, she would most likely defeat the Dormant Lord, even his enhanced current form.</p><br><p>"You... I don't know your name."</p><br><p>With some hesitation, Katrin cast a sidelong glance, but eventually decided to answer:</p><br><p>"Katrin... My name is Katrin, you monster!"</p><br><p>"I see, in that case, Katrin, you need to die. Right now."</p><br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch loosened its grip on the trident, allowing it to hover in the air for a moment.</p><br><p>Before Katrin and Adam could realize anything, the trident shuddered, becoming a flash.</p><br><p>With lightning speed, the trident flew into Katrin's stomach, the three sharp tips effortlessly piercing her flesh.</p><br><p>Blood rushed outward, flying in front of Katrin's wide-open eyes. The trident didn't stop there, dragging Katrin forward until she crashed into a massive ice chunk from the tower.</p><br><p>Only a single shadow was visible among the cloud of cold vapor - long and active, the trident quickly returned to its owner.</p><br><br><p>'What the hell...? A minute ago he had to put effort to hold us back, but... Now he just defeated Katrin in one move?'</p><br><p>Then, Adam's gaze dropped lower, scrutinizing the Crimson Monarch's trident. One of the three tips, the left one, was missing.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch couldn't use this attack an unlimited number of times, but... even one attack was enough for Katrin.</p><br><p>Streams of wind dispelled the frosty vapor, revealing Katrin's silhouette. She was breathing heavily, but her eyes were closed and her stomach looked as if a wild beast tore her apart in search of food.</p><br><p>Her scythe held on with the tips of her fingers, growing weaker by the moment.</p><br><p>Suddenly, her hand twitched slightly, immediately dropping down from exhaustion. Oddly enough, she achieved her goal, that movement was enough.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Katrin's coat shuddered, flinging off her body. It seemed that her loyal ally, her Initial Order, betrayed her. She was wounded among the cold lands, but it was her will.</p><br><p>Like a spawn of darkness, the coat absorbed the scythe into itself and quickly headed towards Adam, running with spidery legs made of ink.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch and Adam watched with curiosity at such a powerful ability to act even when the wielder was dying.</p><br><p>Without refusing the gift, Adam reached forward, taking the strange darkness to himself.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the darkness turned into a long coat temporarily replacing Adam's past clothing. The material was the same as for Katrin, after all, it was her ability, but the coat adjusted to Adam's physique and his needs in battle.</p><br><p>Several slits at the bottom and on the sleeves provided him mobility, while many straps like chains covered his legs giving him extra stability.</p><br><p>However, that wasn't all, for in the process the dark coat had absorbed Katrin's scythe, temporarily making it its part and so now it was an advantage to Adam.</p><br><p>Sharp, heavy plates appeared on the edges of the coat, thin threads like a steel net covering the left and right sides, leaving only Adam's back unprotected.</p><br><p>His collar grew much higher, covering half his face, the sharp spikes reflected in his calm blue eyes.</p><br><p>Impressed, the Crimson Monarch turned to the side, gazing at the slowly breathing Katrin.</p><br><p>"It is remarkable. She has such powerful abilities... Where did she get them from?"</p><br><p>Slowly, he shifted his gaze to Adam.</p><br><p>"I'm not going to hide it. If you had her abilities, I might well have a chance of defeat. I'm afraid your abilities are not as outstanding as hers."</p><br><p>In response, Adam only shrugged nonchalantly, getting used to the new sensation. Unlike Katrin, he had no idea how to work with such equipment.</p><br><p>"I'm fine with my abilities. The power of your abilities depends on yourself because they grow with you, don't they?"</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch nodded deeply, imperceptibly the grip on his trident became tighter.</p><br><p>"Sure, the truth is so. Yet, your abilities don't have the widest functionality, with something more complex you would be capable of more."</p><br><p>A sharp glint traveled along Adam's eyes.</p><br><p>"Strength in simplicity."</p><br><br><p>Then, amidst the quiet conversation, the Crimson Monarch released his trident again. Making a deadly attack for the second and final time, the right tip was ready to shatter upon its completion.</p><br><p>Adam wasn't ready for that, but he didn't need to be. He knew he could defend himself, at least once.</p><br><br><p>A split second before the collision, Adam crossed his arms, exposing his flame bracelets.</p><br><p>If he could trade them for the Crimson Monarch's spent trump card, Lone Blaze's latest boost would not be in waste.</p><br><p>The trident tried to pierce Adam's hands, but streams of fire sacrificed themselves to distance that moment.</p><br><p>Gradually, the trident's momentum faded to nothing, the right tip shattering turning the trident practically into a spear.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch frowned, this was not the result he expected.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze's voice echoed in Adam's mind.</p><br><p>[You don't know how to handle my gifts properly.]</p><br><br><p>Adam's silhouette shuddered, the dark coat answering his call.</p><br><p>"Don't worry. Your gift will bring me victory. There's not much left..."</p><br><p>With confidence in his imminent victory, Adam rushed forward. He believed his strength would be enough to find the right moment to inflict a wound on the Crimson Monarch that he would never recover from.</p>
