            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1245: Calm Fog (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Powerful gusts of wind greeted Adam, a guest whom no one here was happy to see.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, neither teleportation nor an experienced pilot in a special fighter jet was able to take him directly to the Forgotten Mills. This was a reality that every K4-Phantom faced.</p><br><p>In the beginning, Adam used simple trucks and drove through the gates of the Citadel, then he used regular fighter jets, followed by faster ones, and finally teleports.</p><br><p>However, that was no longer enough.</p><br><p>The territories were too far from the Citadel, the places were too dangerous, and only a Phantom like him could survive here.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The white flame flared at Adam’s feet, greatly slowing his fall. It was his best result ever, because unlike his previous attempts, his sting was soft and his fall smooth.</p><br><p>He was still unable to stand in the air like the stronger Phantoms and monsters, but he was very close to it.</p><br><p>‘Hmm, if I take another step in strength, maybe I can achieve it. Will it happen at the Connected Heart or after the Second Grand Star?’ Adan thought, gradually approaching the ground while the wind aggressively fluttered his hair.</p><br><p>‘Adam, the pilot has already told you about this. Your destination is the Glass Bridge, which is located in the north. Once you cross it, you will soon find yourself at the Forgotten Mills.’</p><br><p>Putting in even more energy, Adam slowed down to the limit, falling as if on a parachute. Then, he turned around, seeing something shiny in the distance, a structure reflecting the dim light falling on these lands.</p><br><p>Although he was not yet at the Forgotten Mills, gray clouds covered the dark forest as well, as did a threatening, wandering mist among the dark trees.</p><br><p>“This forest. Should I be afraid of someone special?” Adam asked.</p><br><p>He saw no buildings nearby, nor anything remarkable except distant mountains and a few tall rocks the size of skyscrapers. Their sharp peaks disappeared behind the clouds.</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head.</p><br><p>“As far as I know, no. The data may be outdated. The last time there was a Phantom in this forest was a few weeks ago, and it was at the edge, while you are closer to the center and will be moving toward the exit.</p><br><p>“In any case, I doubt you’ll encounter an Elder, maybe a few Lesser Elders, but there’s definitely no one stronger here, let alone the Lords.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded weakly. He was unusually serious today. Something about this mission had caused him to change his attitude, for the time being.</p><br><p>“Got it. However, I sense several sources of auras below. Someone is waiting for me. I don’t think they’re very happy to see me.”</p><br><p>Silvana waved her hand carelessly. “Most likely, they’re just ordinary Black Threat Monsters. They won’t be a threat, but they may waste your time.”</p><br><br><p>After that, Adam weakened his energy, thus significantly accelerating his fall. He had learned everything he needed to know about the dark forest, so it was time to act.</p><br><p>‘First this forest, then the bridge, and only then the Forgotten Mills. Damn, traveling as a K4-Phantom is not easy at all.’</p><br><br><p>With a crash, Adam hit the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust. Falling from great heights had long ceased to be a problem for him.</p><br><p>As he expected, as soon as his feet touched the surface, there was movement from the side.</p><br><br><p>Several dark spikes pierced the smoke screen. They had no specific target, but there were many of them, wanting to make many holes in Adam.</p><br><p>A similar sound came from all sides, so Adam realized that dozens of spikes were flying at him right now, which he could hardly dodge.</p><br><p>However… He knew they were much weaker.</p><br><p>With a cold stare, Adam raised his leg and slammed it down on the ground with all his might.</p><br><p>The shockwave spread out in white flames, destroying all the spikes along with the smoke screen with its flow.</p><br><p>Adam turned around to see the attackers.</p><br><p>Many dark-skinned monsters were hiding behind the trees. They had thin legs and arms, but their backs were broad, covered with hundreds of spikes, like hedgehogs. Even their elongated noses and amber eyes were somewhat similar.</p><br><p>“You, can you speak?” Adam asked.</p><br><p>He could attack them and kill every one of them, he could feel it, but… Why?</p><br><br><p>However, instead of coherent speech, he only received an irritated groan as the monsters moved back, closer to the fog.</p><br><p>‘They are so strong, but they are not the Awakened Monsters? That’s unusual… or is it normal for such remote regions?’</p><br><p>Adam was about to try to make contact again, but at that very moment, the ground began to shake violently.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Turning around, he saw a massive shadow in the distance, gradually approaching him.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, preparing for battle, but even though the creature was almost directly in front of him, he did not sense any malicious intent.</p><br><p>‘What the hell…?’ Adam’s eyes widened as he looked at the great tree, similar to others but much larger, moving toward him on two legs, like a human.</p><br><p>Its eyes shone brightly with an amber light, but they were deep and full of meaning, like those of a sage who had lived for hundreds of years. Its mighty body and calm but powerful aura showed that fighting it would not be easy, even for Adam.</p><br><p>It was the Dark Ent, one of many inhabiting this forest.</p><br><p>“Young man… Are you really Phantom…?” The Dark Ent slowly spoke, towering over Adam. It was large enough to crush Adam with its palm.</p><br><p>Adam frowned. The difference in size was noticeable, but more than that, he was alarmed by the fog that was darkening around the living tree.</p><br><p>“Yes, why do you ask so uncertainly?”</p><br><br><p>The Dark Ent replied only after a few seconds:</p><br><p>“Because you are young… very young… You are not even a quarter of a century old… Compared to many here, you are just a baby, a larva, or a young sapling…”</p><br><p>These were not the comparisons Adam had expected, but still, it was his chance to get some useful information.</p><br><p>The Dark Ent leaned forward.</p><br><p>“Why did you come here?”</p><br><br><p>“The Glass Bridge. I want to know how to get there quickly and safely.”</p><br><p>He turned to the Dark Ent.</p><br>
