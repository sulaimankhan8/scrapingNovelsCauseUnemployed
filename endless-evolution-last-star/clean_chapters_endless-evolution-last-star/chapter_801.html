            <br><p>Katrin's heart clenched with fear. She saw how fast the Crimson Monarch's attack was. She didn't have time to dodge his thrust, but... at the last moment, a tall silhouette appeared between them.</p><br><p>Unlike her coat, Adam's one was torn in many places, the monster thread regenerating too slowly to cover all of Adam's wounds from battles.</p><br><p>Yet, his posture appeared much sturdier than hers. The corners of Katrin's lips turned upward - he came to save her.</p><br><p>Then, came Adam's voice:</p><br><p>"Ten seconds - your time is up."</p><br><p>It was the only reason Adam entered the fray, shattering Katrin's joyful expression into pieces.</p><br><p>'What...? Ten seconds? Are you shitting on me?!'</p><br><br><p>Adam's fist smashed into the Crimson Monarch's face. Unlike Katrin who flew away from the impact, the Crimson Monarch didn't even take a step back.</p><br><p>With a thud, the Crimson Monarch took Adam's punch, not moving for a while, only the snake resting on his shoulder hissed irritably.</p><br><p>Then, he slowly pulled back, ignoring Katrin.</p><br><p>A single trickle of blood came out of his nose, his nose was broken, but regeneration was already returning the crooked bones to their original position.</p><br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch turned his gaze to Katrin, disgust on his face.</p><br><p>"I couldn't deal with her in ten seconds. I won't ask for a second chance, it was just a way to save my time anyway."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, his eyes wide open.</p><br><p>"Hah? You shouldn't underestimate her. The fact that she lasted ten seconds already says a lot."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's eyebrow twitched; he didn't want to believe Adam was serious.</p><br><p>But, before he could say anything, Adam's right hand turned into a flash.</p><br><br><p>With a loud crunch, Adam's fist smashed into the Crimson Monarch's jaw from below like a steel hammer.</p><br><p>A wave of shivers ran through the ground, particles of snow surged up, but the Crimson Monarch didn't budge, taking the full force of the blow.</p><br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch muttered as he watched the disk of light floating in the middle of the night sky.</p><br><p>"So this isn't the first time you've fought alongside this maiden. Is that love...? No... You're not interested in her as a woman. Well... then you're hoping for her development as a fighter. What naive foolishness..."</p><br><p>In an instant, Katrin's face turned red, her heart racing as she wanted to scream to refute the Crimson Monarch's words.</p><br><p>Unlike her, Adam didn't show any vivid emotion.</p><br><p>"I don't believe it. I know she can - she did it once, just stopped. I'm sure it's a temporary hardship, she'll prove it."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch lowered his gaze, Adam's fist still at his chin.</p><br><p>"She will ruin you Adam Vinter. There is nothing wrong with helping the weak, to protect them, but..."</p><br><p>For a few seconds, his gaze stopped on Katrin.</p><br><p>"The strong ones should not assume that the weak are equal to them. It will only lead to negative consequences, especially for the weak side. Though... naivety is inherent in young and eager souls."</p><br><p>Adam shook his head, he took a deep breath.</p><br><p>"Tsk. As I said earlier - you're not the first to be crushed by pride, even justified one."</p><br><p>Then, Adam leaped to the side, finding himself behind the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the Crimson Monarch went into battle mode, blocking Adam's next punch.</p><br><p>Even though Adam's rings were in crimson form, his hits couldn't throw the Crimson Monarch aside or damage his opponent's arms.</p><br><p>They were on equal footing.</p><br><p>For every one of Adam's punches, the Crimson Monarch managed to block in time, but he was in the same situation.</p><br><br><p>A lighting ray flew out of the dense orb, Adam jerked his head sharply, missing the deadly attack by a few centimeters.</p><br><p>Then, he lifted his leg up, turning sharply to build up momentum. Before the Crimson Monarch could counterattack, Adam's foot aimed at the monster's chest like a spear.</p><br><p>Electric shocks ran through the Crimson Monarch's eyes, his body moving automatically obeying instincts honed by hundreds of fights.</p><br><p>With a gust of wind, Adam's foot swept next to the Crimson Monarch's, grazing his cheek. But, no sooner had the drops of blood rushed from the cut than they froze in mid-air, quickly returning to their owner.</p><br><p>With a tiny delay, they glanced over continuing their endless exchange of blows.</p><br><p>All the while, Katrin watched them. They were fighting a few meters away from her, she could clearly see every move, feeling useless.</p><br><p>'No... It's just their physical strength. No one is using abilities. They hit each other and the ground shakes, the regeneration won't allow any of them to win even if they are severely wounded.'</p><br><p>Then, Alan's words rang out in her mind.</p><br><p>'Katrin, go ahead. There's no point in listening to what the monster is saying, but Adam is another matter. He's right - if you've survived ten seconds then you can be in their fight. Isn't that why you've been waiting for this moment?'</p><br><p>Alan clenched his fists, gathering his strength for one last speech. He knew that for Katrin this was the most dangerous fight in her history.</p><br><p>'Help him, you can defeat a deadly enemy again - you can get stronger. This is your best chance!'</p><br><p>Like a soulless puppet, Katrin nodded slightly as her fingers gripped the hilt of her swords tightly.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, she darted forward, finding herself behind the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>He noticed it, he didn't need to look in her direction to feel her aura.</p><br><p>"Pffft, what a poorly executed attack. That girl is a disaster, not a fighter.''</p><br><p>Without saying a word, the Crimson Monarch took a step to the side, two black blades whizzing by his side.</p><br><p>Then, he leaned back, passing Adam's kick over his chest.</p><br><p>Katrin's lips trembled, her pupils narrowed. She couldn't stop thinking about past events. From the Plague Reaper, the Blind Sinner, to the Crimson Monarch's scornful treatment.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Following her will, the black coat trembled, the edges turning into blades heading towards the Crimson Monarch under Katrin's fiery scream:</p><br><p>"Don't you dare underestimate me! Monster!"</p><br><br><p>The blades pierced the Crimson Monarch's chest, reminding him how vivid the pain could be.</p>
