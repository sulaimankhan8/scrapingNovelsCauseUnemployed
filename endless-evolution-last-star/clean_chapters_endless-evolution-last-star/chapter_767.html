            <br><p>One Phantom after another approached Katrin, the supports from different squads trying to do everything in their power to bring Katrin back to her peak state.</p><br><p>Sure, regardless of the Phantom's strength it could only take a certain amount of amplification, but the amplifications could be short and fast, in a brief period positively affecting the Phantom's state.</p><br><p>It was no different from the rapid healing that the military and Phantoms received when they returned to the Citadel, except it was done by other Phantoms spending their energy on their abilities.</p><br><p>It was impossible to do it during a battle, it took time, at least ten minutes, yet even after three minutes Katrin was already feeling much better.</p><br><p>From time to time, they checked how Viron and Gnash were doing, their confidence in their capabilities was not false.</p><br><p>Already at that moment, it was obvious that their victory was inevitable.</p><br><p>The Grim Warro was left without his right arm, while Viron received only a few scratches, and his pace increased so much that in the next few minutes, he would destroy the Grim Warro, down to the last splinter.</p><br><p>Gnash's scenario was not as active and violent, but she had already converted the massive fight into a 1 vs 1 format. The Essence Silent Droao tried to attack her, only to face failure each time. Time after time, gravity waves and purple projectiles damaged the Silent Droao's bubble, bringing the monster closer to exhaustion.</p><br><p>There was no change only between the main battle - the Dormant Lord and the Blind Sinner.</p><br><p>Their equal fight continued at the same intimidating pace. No one could or would try to stop them, they had reached such a stage, such a speed that even Katrin would be annihilated in seconds if she tried to get between them.</p><br><p>The rest of the Phantoms defended the walls of the fortress as before, the monsters were growing in number, the Eclipse was only at its midpoint, and the longer it went on the more dangerous it became.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, ripples of trembling came from the depths of the fortress. It wasn't the first time, but now the quivering was active enough that every Phantom could feel it.</p><br><p>The man looked around, he frowned heavily.</p><br><p>"What is that? It doesn't look like it's a shockwave from the battles at the ice towers."</p><br><p>The girl standing not far from him nodded.</p><br><p>"Yeah, is it just me, or is it coming from below?"</p><br><p>"Hm? Does the fortress have a lower level? We couldn't find anything."</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Katrin slammed her fist into the wall, dark shards flew aside, causing the Phantoms to help her recover to gasp.</p><br><p>The Phantoms exchanged a confused look.</p><br><p>Had their brief conversation annoyed her that much?</p><br><p>Gritting her teeth, Katrin bit her lip until it bled, her eyes bloodshot with anger, a shiver running through her body.</p><br><p>"You're right, you're all right..."</p><br><p>Katrin wheezed, clenching her fist tightly, the stone clutched in her grip turned to a handful of dust, the leather stretched over her whitened knuckles.</p><br><p>"While we're here fighting, trying to survive, the first Phantom that came here is busy with his mission, he's doing something in the depths of the fortress. There's definitely a passage there, but his Operator is keeping that information from us."</p><br><p>Quickly, many Phantoms received dark stares. They were well aware of what the Unknown Phantom did but preferred not to think about it too much.</p><br><p>The most optimistic ones hoped that this Phantom had defeated all the commanders and was badly wounded and hiding somewhere in the fortress, but... the longer the Eclipse went on, the less that theory made sense.</p><br><p>Katrin closed her eyes, she frowned heavily.</p><br><p>"I know this isn't what I should be thinking about right now, I'm sorry, but I'm just torn with anger that this Phantom could help us and then fulfill his mission. His decision alone might save a lot of lives..."</p><br><p>The Phantoms nodded silently, deep inside they knew that Katrin was right.</p><br><p>They didn't know anything about this Phantom, but two things were certain now - it was a strong man and just as selfish.</p><br><br><br><p>Fists coated in crimson energy shattered the Savage Broako's bones, skin ripped apart and muscles split into fibers under the pressure.</p><br><p>The effect of the irregular energy of the temple and the natural abilities of the Regenerative Monster was great enough to make the Savage Broako virtually immortal.</p><br><p>However, Adam had experience fighting against such monsters. He couldn't kill the Savage Broako in one powerful attack, it was simply impossible, but he could exhaust his opponent.</p><br><p>Throwing the needle aside, Adam activated his rings, his new Nexus given to him from the Two Walls.</p><br><p>The Savage Broako tried to fight back, but Adam was too fast. In the first few blows he destroyed the monster's cleaver, depriving his opponent of only weapon, then he attacked at every opportunity.</p><br><p>Adam didn't say anything, he wasn't even thinking. At that moment he did two things - breathing and striking.</p><br><p>His fists rained down on the Savage Broako in a deadly hail, the wounds recovered in seconds, but gradually the time became longer and longer.</p><br><p>The Savage Broako's energy was coming to an end.</p><br><br><p>Feeling helpless, the Savage Broako roared in despair, even he could no longer bear the incessant bursts of pain filling his mind.</p><br><br><p>No longer believing in his victory, the Savage Broako leaped forward, wanting to reach the black coffin, there was still hope in his eyes.</p><br><br><p>Two fists came down on his head, blasting his skull into bloody shards. The Savage Broako tried to recover, but his strength was at an end.</p><br><br><p>Adam took a deep breath, hot steam drifted in front of him, he stood on the dead the Savage Broako, who was supposed to be his most difficult opponent.</p><br><br><p>His silhouette shuddered as he found himself a few steps away from the black coffin.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The First Wall was shaking vigorously. The opponent Adam was meant to kill was right there.</p><br><p>With a wave of his hand, without wasting time, Adam threw back the top lid of the coffin, expecting to be attacked by another strong monster.</p><br><br><br><p>Adam's eyes went blank for a moment in disbelief.</p><br><p>There was no monster in the coffin, just someone's skeleton of black bones, it had long since lost its skin and flesh.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>However, in the very center of the chest, a dark heart slowly continued to beat, a stream of blood flowing away moved towards the dark pond.</p><br><br><p>Lone Blaze's voice trembled.</p><br><p>[This is where I was born...]</p>
