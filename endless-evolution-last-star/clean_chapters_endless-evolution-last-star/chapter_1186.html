            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1186: What lies behind the thunder?</strong></p><br><p>Even if Phantom reached K3-Level, it did not guarantee that he would be able to fly. Special abilities were required for that. Monsters had an advantage in this regard, as they could have wings like the Kirani Guards.</p><br><p>However, at the K4 Level, everything gradually changed. Adam was just learning this new ability, which at first did not seem very useful to him. Initially, he thought that its usefulness was limited to slowing down his fall when jumping out of a fighter jet.</p><br><p>Now, it became clear to him that against flying enemies, controlling energy in this way made life much easier.</p><br><p>All he did was condense energy in the air to push himself half a meter to the side. But that was enough for a powerful lance to fly past him.</p><br><p>For the Second Rank Phantoms, this was no problem. They did it as naturally as they breathed.</p><br><p>Adam needed practice to achieve their mastery, and there was nothing better than combat for that.</p><br><p>“Hah, fine, I know what I have to do.” Adam chuckled as he waved his hand.</p><br><p>Instead of using his new ability or activating his Nexus, he got rid of it. The five rings shattered into fragments, disappearing into his inner space.</p><br><p>‘Hmm?’ Silvana raised an eyebrow in confusion. ‘Didn’t you want to defeat them quickly so you could watch Fromund’s fight?’</p><br><p>“Well, I found something interesting for myself, so I’ll take care of that first.”</p><br><p>The Kirani Guards looked at each other. They didn’t understand what Adam was doing, but they couldn’t miss this opportunity. They simultaneously rushed forward in an attempt to grab Adam, knowing that he would soon reach the ground.</p><br><p>However, Adam had no intention of falling.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Using significantly more energy than was needed for a simple jump, Adam created a platform beneath him that vaguely resembled a square cloud.</p><br><p>The platform held its shape for only half a second before collapsing, but that was enough for Adam to leap upward.</p><br><p>Then, another and another.</p><br><p>In the end, Adam found himself significantly higher than the two Kirani Guards who were staring at him with wide eyes. It was unusual for them to see a creature without wings climb so high.</p><br><p>“Hahaha! Come on, are you going to stay down there for long?! Attack me!” Adam exclaimed, spreading his arms wide.</p><br><p>The Kirani Guards looked at each other. Strange as it seemed, Adam was right. They had to attack him.</p><br><p>THUNDER! THUNDER! THUNDER!</p><br><p>At the same moment, unexpectedly, thunderclaps in wild strikes crashed down on the ground. Several dozen thunderbolts came out of the storm, some of them landing right next to the Kirani Guards, practically turning them into pieces of ash.</p><br><br><p>For a split second, Adam saw an emotion strange to insects on the Kirani Guards’ faces — fear.</p><br><p>This storm was not just a natural phenomenon. Something was hiding behind it, and that something could scare the Kirani Guards so much that they attacked Adam and Fromund without hesitation, even though the risk of death was high.</p><br><p>‘Could it be that this storm and the Twilight Crystals are somehow connected? These guards… They’re not the strongest, I’ve already figured that out. So, it’s no surprise that they’re afraid.’</p><br><p>Adam realized that the situation with the Corrupted Volcano and the Kirani Colony might be more complicated than he had initially thought.</p><br><p>“I see.” Adam nodded deeply as a second needle appeared in his hand. “So now I really don’t have any time.”</p><br><p>With a whistle of wind, Adam swung the needle twice.</p><br><p>On the first swing, he ended up to the left of the guards, and on the second, he swept through their strong bodies, tearing them apart with ease.</p><br><p>Sure, he could have done this from the start, but Adam was glad he spent a little time improving his energy control.</p><br><br><p>Fromund’s fist slammed into the guard’s head, blowing it to pieces in a fiery burst.</p><br><p>“Alright! One down!” Fromund exclaimed with excitement in his eyes. “Hopefully, the next one will be tougher!”</p><br><p>However, when he turned toward the second guard, he saw something unexpected.</p><br><p>The wide blade of the needle sliced through the monster’s neck, killing the guard in one smooth stroke.</p><br><p>Fromund’s pupils narrowed, then he frowned.</p><br><p>“Hey! What the hell?! We agreed that we’d each take two!” Fromund waved his fist in annoyance.</p><br><p>Adam didn’t answer, he just looked up at the gathering clouds and raging lightning. The storm was getting more intense. The thunderbolts were constantly striking the ground.</p><br><p>“Sorry, but I think we should hurry. As soon as we started fighting these bugs, the storm suddenly got stronger. Is it a coincidence or… are they going to call someone to defend them?”</p><br><p>From Adam’s reaction and his cold face, Fromund realized he was serious.</p><br><p>“I see. Yeah, maybe you’re right. I noticed that too when several bolts of lightning struck a few meters away from me, but I decided it was just a coincidence.”</p><br><p>“I don’t know what it is — a call for help or, on the contrary, someone saw that their colony was in a vulnerable state, but it doesn’t matter. We need to move forward quickly. Now that they know about us, there’s a risk they’ll rush to absorb the Twilight Crystals and we’ll fail our mission.”</p><br><p>Fromund crossed his arms over his chest and shook his head.</p><br><p>“Nah, I’m not going to fail the mission because of something like that!”</p><br><p>Then, he turned around as awkwardness covered his face.</p><br><p>“Well… Where was the entrance? I forgot…”</p><br><p>A few words from Arayna, and they both found themselves in front of the only place that hadn’t been struck by lightning yet. More accurately, it had, but the barrier had absorbed everything.</p><br><br><p>Adam swung his needle, creating a breach in the barrier. He had many strengths and weaknesses, but he never had any trouble breaking through someone’s defenses, at least until he encountered Arnoth.</p><br><p>The glowing pillars attempted to restore the barrier, and they did so in a matter of seconds, but Adam and Fromund were already inside.</p><br><p>With a single punch, Fromund smashed the stone slab, revealing a deep tunnel leading into the depths of the colony.</p><br><p>“Let’s go?” Fromund asked.</p><br><p>Adam glanced one last time at the raging storm and nodded.</p><br><p>“Sure. Let’s see where this passage and the lightning take us.”</p>
