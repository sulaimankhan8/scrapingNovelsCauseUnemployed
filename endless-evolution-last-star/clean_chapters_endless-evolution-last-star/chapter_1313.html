            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1313: Spatula and Line (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Adam often fell into a deep sleep after battle, but would wake up a few hours later, ready to move on.</p><br><p>If he had suffered serious injuries, the rest period could be extended, but not by much, each case was unique.</p><br><p>The battle at the wind plain, the String Duel, was no exception to this rule.</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam opened his eyes, feeling a powerful drowsiness that wanted to plunge him back into sleep. He touched his temple, feeling a severe headache as he frowned.</p><br><p>“Where the hell am I?”</p><br><p>There was no battlefield or destroyed mill in sight, only a massive bed covered with a black sheet. Ahead, he could see a door with warm light coming from the other side, which immediately attracted Adam’s attention.</p><br><p>“I see, so I’m in someone’s mill? It must have been Norax, only he is capable of such a thing,” Adam pondered before getting out of bed, but as soon as he touched the surface, a shiver ran through his body, causing him to fall to the floor.</p><br><p>The shock on Adam’s face was great. He felt neither pain nor exhaustion, and there were no visible wounds on his body.</p><br><p>However, he could barely muster the strength to get up, and even then, only by leaning on the bed for support.</p><br><p>“Shit, what’s going on here? I have to check this out…” He frowned and clenched his fist tightly.</p><br><p>The energy flowed to his hand, more active and powerful than before, even compared to when he used the Dual Demon Sword.</p><br><p>He nodded deeply, making sure everything was as it should be—his power remained with him and had increased significantly after defeating Ureyn.</p><br><p>‘Well, that’s what was supposed to happen after absorbing the Connected Heart, right? I don’t know how much strength Ureyn lost, but considering what I gained, I could now defeat him with a few precise strikes.’</p><br><p>A strange feeling filled Adam.</p><br><p>He didn’t understand where he was, although he had an idea. He was very weak and strong at the same time, and he had no answers.</p><br><p>“Silvana, do you know anything about this place?”</p><br><p>As always, she was ready to answer his call at any moment.</p><br><p>“No, I was only able to reestablish contact with you just now. While you were asleep, all I could do was wait, and… Adam, it was a long time. I started to worry.’</p><br><p>“Hmm? Long? What do you mean?”</p><br><p>‘A month. You slept for a whole month, Adam.’</p><br><p>As soon as her words were spoken, Adam’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br><p>Throughout his entire journey, he had never spent so much time even on rest and recovery, and the times he had lost his arm in battle were no exception.</p><br><p>“What? A whole month and I feel like crap? I should be glowing with power like a nuclear reactor after everything that’s happened!”</p><br><p>‘Khm.’ Silvana coughed. ‘You are… kind of.’</p><br><p>After that, Silvana and Adam went to the inner space where Adam saw the usual picture.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree was in place, as was the Path Construct, partially covered in mysterious darkness.</p><br><p>“And? What’s going on here? I don’t see anything unusual.” Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>Silvana looked at the Evolution Tree and nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“Show him. He needs to see this, even if it may be a little inappropriate at this moment.”</p><br><p>Without delay, apart from the calm, white energy emanating from the Evolution Tree, a rich golden light burst forth from the cracks in its bark, like rays from a great sun hidden inside the tree.</p><br><p>However, this did not bring Adam joy, only a great frown. He understood that this was not good news.</p><br><p>“And? Will someone explain to me what is going on here?”</p><br><p>Silvana turned to him. “The problem is that we are not sure what is going on, but we have one theory.”</p><br><p>“What is it?” Adam asked, staring intently at the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>[You absorbed too much energy, Adam… You shouldn’t absorb energy directly at all because you’re a human… but the Connected Heart is something of an exception…]</p><br><p>“Because my and Ureyn’s energy and abilities are similar, right?”</p><br><p>[Exactly… Also, you used up a lot of energy during the fight… I don’t know what you were thinking, but the Dual Demon Sword is a much more dangerous weapon than you think.]</p><br><p>Adam looked at his artifact, which was part of the Evolution Tree, and bit his lip.</p><br><p>“Yeah, now I understand. Using lightning was easy and free, I could do almost anything I wanted, but what was the result? It took me a whole damn month to wake up!”</p><br><p>[The main thing is that you know that now… You did it in the best way possible, in battle, defeating a strong enemy… but that means that all the energy from Ureyn came here when I was in my most exhausted state.]</p><br><p>“Are you saying that’s why the energy from the Connected Heart hasn’t been completely absorbed yet?”</p><br><br><p>The sharp response alarmed Adam, as it showed that he would not be able to deal with the aftermath of the battle quickly.</p><br><p>[Because of this, I just needed more time… That’s why you slept for so long, but as you can see, you haven’t fully recovered yet, even though all this power is yours.]</p><br><p>Adam nodded as he clenched his fist tightly. He had struggled to get up from the ground a minute earlier. It wasn’t the level of strength he wanted.</p><br><p>[You need to find a way to subdue this energy, because I can’t do it. You can use this energy, that’s for sure, but it hasn’t fully become part of your power and is destructive in nature.]</p><br><p>The rare cracks on the bark showed that the Evolution Tree was right.</p><br><p>“So, I need to tame this wild beast I got from Ureyn. Am I right?”</p><br><p>[I guess yes. These are just my assumptions and the result of our discussions with Silvana. However, although we are almost certain about what you should do, we don’t know how.]</p><br><p>Silvana nodded toward the golden rays.</p><br><p>“I tried to access them, but they don’t recognize me.”</p><br><p>“I see…” Adam’s eyes deepened. “Because they came to me first, the winner of the String Duel, and only then to the Phantom, Adam Vinter.”</p>
