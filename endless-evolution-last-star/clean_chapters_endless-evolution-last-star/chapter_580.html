            <br><p>Every spectator was interested to see the fighters, after all, the quality and spectacle of the future battle depended on the quality of the fighters.
</p><br><p>However, everyone in the arena, before Adam and Fromund appeared, had already seen them, or rather their photos in the purple room. Many of the spectators, especially those who were Phantoms, and there were quite a few of them, found information about each fighter with the help of their Operators and their connections.
</p><br><p>However, there were at least three people in the arena who saw Adam for the first time. Oddly enough, they had some of the best seats, even compared to the boxes of the higher nobles.
</p><br><p>"That’s him... Adam Vinter..." Liv hissed like a snake, staring intently at her brother’s opponent.
</p><br><p>Elva nodded deeply, her gaze no less stern.
</p><br><p>"Yes, don’t you think he looks kind of weird...? He’s too calm. Damn, in the movie and TV series, guys like him are always the most dangerous!"
</p><br><br><p>Liv nodded a few times, her gaze running from Fromund to Adam.
</p><br><p>Erik adjusted his hat, looking over his shoulder at Tilda who stood beside him, though she could at any moment take her current empty seat.
</p><br><p>"What do you think? Does Adam Vinter look strong or was the arrival of your brother more impressive?"
</p><br><p>Tilting her head, Tilda said slowly:
</p><br><p>"He’s weak. Brother is stronger."
</p><br><p>Erik’s eyes went wide for a moment.
</p><br><p>’Oh, what a direct and quick answer. Did she say it because she believes in her brother or because Adam is actually weaker...? Hehehe, so glad I placed the bet. It’s getting more interesting by the second.’
</p><br><p>A sly smirk appeared on Erik’s face.
</p><br><p>’300 million... It’s not the largest sum, but it would still be a shame to lose it.’
</p><br><br><p>Erik glanced at Adam.
</p><br><p>Osana bit her lip as she turned to Baren who sat next to her. Though they were of the Rouzet Family, but given the circumstances, Kogen’s box was a better place for them.
</p><br><p>"Brother... What do you say?"
</p><br><p>Baren glanced at their handshake, after a few seconds he nodded.
</p><br><p>"That girl is right. Adam is weaker."
</p><br><br><p>"Decided to start without even showing your weapon?" Adam asked, feeling the pressure on his arm.
</p><br><p>Fromund’s forearm muscles slowly tensed and his fingers tightened around Adam’s hand like heavy chains.
</p><br><p>"Well, I do not doubt that you are a worthy fighter. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a chance to fight against the Plague Reaper, they’re rare guests and I’m a very busy man. Gotta work all the time, you know?"
</p><br><p>Fromund shrugged with a heavy sigh.
</p><br><p>"I just want to make sure you’re not weak, just in case. I’ve had it happen to me a few times that I thought I had a decent fight waiting for me, but... it was over in one punch."
</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, listening intently to Fromund.
</p><br><br><p>Fromund scratched the back of his head, not loosening his grip.
</p><br><p>"So... I realized it’s better to figure out who’s up against me at the beginning, so I don’t get disappointed by false expectations."
</p><br><p>At the same moment, Fromund’s nonchalant, somewhat awkward expression vanished, replaced by a cold stare.
</p><br><p>Fromund squeezed Adam’s hand with all his might, intending not just to apply pressure but to break his bones.
</p><br><p>With a wave of shivers running through his body, Adam’s eyes opened wide at Fromund’s sudden strength.
</p><br><p>Wasting no time, Adam responded by trying to squeeze Fromund’s hand with even more force, but... he quickly realized that he simply couldn’t overcome Fromund’s pressure.
</p><br><p>’What the hell...?’ Adam internally muttered feeling his whole body tense up, his legs wanting to start shaking, willing to drop to the ground.
</p><br><p>Adam’s gaze darted to Fromund’s stone case.
</p><br><p>He didn’t want to start a real battle when his opponent hadn’t even shown his weapon yet, his Nexus.
</p><br><p>’No... If this keeps going on like this, I’m just going to fall. Fuck... I never thought the opponent’s physical strength would be superior to mine... Not after all the fighting and training I’ve been through...’
</p><br><p>However, there was no panic in Adam’s gaze, just a brief look of surprise that already passed.
</p><br><p>"Damn, just a few more seconds and you’ll break my fingers. Hah, I can’t let that happen." Adam smiled bitterly, shaking his head.
</p><br><p>Fromund lifted his chin, a wide grin on his face.
</p><br><p>"And? What on earth are you going to do? I’m not going to loosen my grip. I won’t miss my chance to defeat you, even if it’s so boring."
</p><br><br><p>Adam exhaled a cold vapor, silencing Fromund, his instincts telling him that he was going to regret his words now.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Ripples rushed through the air as Adam’s dark eyes shone brightly.
</p><br><p>Fromund was ready to block the attack, he assumed that Adam used one of his abilities, but... Adam wouldn’t do that, since he also wanted to see if his opponent was worthy of a fight.
</p><br><p>"You are strong. Stronger than me, but muscles aren’t all Phantoms are capable of, are they?" Adam smiled broadly, white flames rising above his shoulders before rushing upwards.
</p><br><p>Within seconds, Adam’s aura transformed into a massive silhouette made up of hundreds of ghostly threads.
</p><br><p>Adam summoned his Spirit, which changed somewhat after he became K2-Phantom. He hadn’t used his The Will for a long time.
</p><br><p>The silhouette still had no distinct legs either, just white fluttering fabric like a long torn coat, the fabric headed upwards in dense threads covering the silhouette’s torso, stopping at the shoulders in the form of two sharp flaps like a collar.
</p><br><p>The arms were long, tied with threads like a tailor’s rather than a mysterious shapeless creature.
</p><br><p>In his right hand was a modified needle looking similar to Adam’s new First Order, his left hand no longer resembled the paw of a monster with long claws.
</p><br><p>Now, threads were running down the left arm, occasionally sparkling with an amber sheen.
</p><br><p>The silhouette was given its face, its head, the lower half of which was covered in a thick cloth, leaving only the deep, gray eyes visible.
</p><br><br><p>Fromund gasped feeling the pressure, Adam’s aura, his white flame from Spirit, trying to break through Fromund’s defense.
</p><br><p>"Hah. I see... It seems I should apologize to you." Fromund coughed as his eyes flashed.
</p><br><p>Then, a stream of red aura like a fierce flame swept in front of him, pointing skyward - wanting to show its power to the ghostly tailor.</p>
