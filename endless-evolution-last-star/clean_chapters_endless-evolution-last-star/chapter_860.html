            <br><p>Not noticing Silvana's embarrassment, Adam walked over to the bed and collapsed in the middle, his stomach down.</p><br><p>He buried his head into the soft pillow, only realizing after a while that Silvana continued to stand in the distance.</p><br><p>Half pulling his face out of the pillow, Adam slowly turned around meeting her gaze.</p><br><p>"Hmm? What's wrong? You don't want to sleep?"</p><br><p>Silvana flinched as she lowered her eyes.</p><br><p>"No, it's not that. Adam, doesn't it bother you that there's only one bed? There must be some mistake."</p><br><p>A mocking smirk slowly appeared on Adam's calm face.</p><br><p>"Hah, after everything that's happened between us, are you embarrassed to sleep in the same bed? Straight up, I'm staying here, so either sleep on the floor or stop being shy like a child."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide in outrage as she clenched her fists tightly.</p><br><p>"You! How can you be so cruel to your Operator!?"</p><br><p>No response followed.</p><br><p>After a few moments, Silvana took a deep breath, knowing that there was no other choice.</p><br><p>"Fine, but..." she looked away, her face turning red, "Don't even expect me to undress..."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><br><p>Then, his eyes glazed over, he finally realized what was bothering Silvana.</p><br><p>"Well, this is unexpected. I didn't know you preferred to sleep naked."</p><br><p>"That's not the point!"</p><br><p>"Hahaha, take your right side. You don't have to worry, I won't disturb your sleep. I'm sure I'll fall asleep a lot faster than you will."</p><br><p>With a short laugh, Adam rolled over to the left side of the bed, he was so full that he was too lazy to take off anything but his shoes.</p><br><br><p>"Tsk, there should be pajamas here."</p><br><p>Oddly enough, she wasn't wrong. Five minutes later, in her white pajamas, she carefully climbed under the spacious blanket.</p><br><p>Silvana's heart was beating a little faster than usual, but she controlled her emotions.</p><br><p>'Calm down... Adam's right, there's nothing wrong with this. After all, it's much better than sleeping on the floor.'</p><br><p>With a slight shudder, Silvana turned around, deep inside afraid to see that all this time Adam had been staring at her.</p><br><p>But... Adam had his back turned to her. He didn't say anything, only his breathing, which was getting slower and slower.</p><br><p>After about ten minutes, when Adam was almost asleep and Silvana realized it, she bit her lip.</p><br><p>Full of uncertainty, Silvana slowly reached out her hand, a little more and her fingers would have touched Adam's shoulder.</p><br><p>At the last moment, Silvana's eyes darkened as she shook her head.</p><br><p>Then, she pulled most of the blanket down over herself wanting to wrap herself up like a cocoon, and turned her back to him.</p><br><p>"It's..." Silvana whispered inaudibly to the already snoring Adam, "That's not what an Operator is supposed to do..."</p><br><p>Staring into the void for almost an hour, immersed in a chaos of thoughts and worries, Silvana gradually fell asleep.</p><br><br><p>For nobles, the morning at the Twilight Palace did not begin with breakfast, but with thinking about their actions.</p><br><p>Who will be my next opponent?</p><br><p>How can I best prove myself and earn five coins?</p><br><p>What do I do if I don't have the right to lose anymore?</p><br><p>Everyone's situation was different. After all, if a nobleman went to the Twilight Palace and came out with zero coins, it meant that among his peers, he was the worst of the worst.</p><br><p>No nobleman, especially from a great family, wanted this disaster to happen. But... for someone to win, there must always be someone to lose.</p><br><p>On this side, Adam and Silvana were different.</p><br><p>Not twenty minutes after their awakening they were at the café, two cups of freshly brewed coffee and sweets brightening their morning.</p><br><p>With a slight crunch, Adam took a bite of a cookie.</p><br><p>"Damn, not that I ever chased luxury but these beds... I've never slept so well! That mattress, it's just a miracle. I wonder how much they cost."</p><br><p>Adam took a large sip, draining a third of his cup.</p><br><p>Silvana in turn nodded. The jets from the hot coffee passed in front of her serene face, hiding her slightly grim look.</p><br><p>"Yes, I felt it too. After all, although not all expensive things justify their price, it's not always a deception. Sometimes, the price matches the quality and in that case, if the price is high, you're getting something truly worthy in exchange."</p><br><p>After a few seconds, without raising her eyes, she added:</p><br><p>"What are you going to do next? I'm sure you're not going to stay here for comfy beds and free coffee."</p><br><p>A gleam passed across Adam's eyes as a satisfied smirk appeared on his face.</p><br><br><p>He crossed his arms over his chest leaning back in his chair.</p><br><p>"Well, my plan is pretty simple - wait."</p><br><br><p>Doubt could be felt in Silvana's voice.</p><br><p>"Don't you think that's a bit of an unreliable plan? I understand that you want to lose two more times, but wouldn't it be better to just offer to fight someone in that case?"</p><br><p>"Meh." Adam waved his hand carelessly, "Those arrogant nobles think they can easily defeat me, that I'm a quick way for them to get coins. And, they're not wrong. You'll see, before lunchtime comes, they'll offer me a fight. We'll be out of here by evening!"</p><br><br><p>Thus passed two days.</p><br><p>On the morning of the third day, Adam and Silvana were in the same cafe. They were silent, both had frowns.</p><br><p>In all this time, not a single nobleman had approached Adam and challenged him to a fight, though he had expected that there would be plenty of willing combatants like Spiro.</p><br><p>Moreover, several times Adam tried to challenge the nobles to fight himself, but they just walked away as if not noticing him. It was a complete ignore.</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Adam hummed, "Maybe Andreas didn't tell us something? This whole thing is kind of weird. Don't they want coins? I have two more!"</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Silvana looked at him.</p><br><p>"Adam, I think this is all about your defeat."</p><br><p>He gave her a baffled expression.</p><br><p>"Hmm? How is that related?"</p><br><p>Drumming on the table, she nodded.</p><br><p>"Directly. I should clarify, though. It's not that you lost, it's that you gave up without a fight... I'm afraid we're in big trouble now."</p>
