            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1202: Hand and Tail (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>The first one she attacked was Fromund. However, it quickly became clear to everyone that he wasn’t her target, but Adam.</p><br><p>Whether Fromund wanted it or not, Bathild didn’t see him as a worthy opponent. Even if he was as strong a Phantom as Adam, it didn’t matter.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, reputation and recognition played a big role in this case.</p><br><p>None of the monsters knew a Phantom like Fromund Aegler. Well, even if a few monsters were aware of Fromund, it was clearly not enough to pique Bathild’s interest.</p><br><p>She decided to fight Adam because it was her way of getting the Title.</p><br><p>All Fromund could do was stand aside and watch Bathild attack Adam with all her might.</p><br><p>She crashed into Adam, shaking the entire Kirani Colony with lightning bolts. Her strike threw Adam aside with such force that the impact sent him dozens of meters underground.</p><br><p>Then, Bathild grinned and rushed forward, continuing to fight Adam within the walls of the colony. At this rate, it would only take them a few minutes to create new caves in this deep underground level.</p><br><p>Perhaps any other Phantom in Fromund’s place would have immediately rushed to Adam’s aid, but he did nothing.</p><br><p>Fromund knew that Adam could handle Bathild. He couldn’t imagine any other outcome to this situation.</p><br><p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p><br><p>Puzzled, no, even confused, Fromund scratched the back of his head.</p><br><p>He looked around as if searching for something to do.</p><br><p>“Damn… I’ve never been in this situation before. I’m just a third wheel! Hell, what should I do? Fry these bugs and make them into barbecue?”</p><br><p>Usually, when Fromund found himself at a dead end, Arayna, his Operator, would help him. This was true for all Phantoms, and the current situation was no exception.</p><br><p>“Don’t worry so much. I’m sure you’ll have a chance to fight as well soon.”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Fromund understood what she was talking about.</p><br><br><p>Not far away, a single powerful aura and more than a dozen slightly weaker ones were approaching the Kirani Colony.</p><br><p>In fact, Marhen and the thunder monsters should have arrived at the Kirani Colony at almost the same time, but Bathild was in such a hurry to confront Adam that she got ahead of Marhen and the others.</p><br><p>However, this was not a problem for either Marhen or Fromund.</p><br><p>They had been waiting for each other, as only they could become equal opponents, or… not?</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same time, two figures fought, destroying the earth and stone around them with every clash like an unstoppable force of nature.</p><br><p>This was not the best place for Bathild. Monsters like her preferred to fight in open, difficult terrain, preferably under a raging thunderstorm.</p><br><p>From this point of view, the Thunder Peaks were ideal, as she could show off all her speed and agility on the dangerous, sharp mountains.</p><br><p>However, she had enough destructive power to cause problems for Adam even here, deep underground, as Adam was in the same situation.</p><br><p>He had never thought about it before, as he had always fought in different places, but narrow caves were not the limit of his dreams as a battlefield.</p><br><p>Unlike Bathild, he needed a spacious, empty arena where he would have time to prepare his strongest attacks and know that his opponent would not be able to dodge.</p><br><p>But… Bathild seemed to know that.</p><br><p>“No, that’s not an assumption,” Adam thought as he swung his arm to deflect Bathild’s halberd.</p><br><p>Electric discharges ran to his right, and he gripped the needle tightly, blocking the next strike.</p><br><p>‘She wanted to fight me, she knows my name, and therefore my abilities as well. Tsk, and I already used my artifact, even though it would have been a surprise to her!</p><br><br><p>In the next clash, Adam allowed a brief delay, and his hand faltered as he parried the attack.</p><br><p>That was enough for Bathild to seize the opportunity. She immediately saw that this was the right moment to take the first step towards victory.</p><br><p>“Too slow, Adam Vinter!” Bathild exclaimed, full of excitement, as her tail began to move.</p><br><p>She wanted to do to Adam what she had done to Fromund when she appeared. However, this time her goal was not just a cut that Adam wouldn’t even notice, but something more important.</p><br><br><p>Cutting through the air, the sharp tip moved toward Adam’s right side. Bathild wanted to pierce his stomach and slit his belly like some kind of animal.</p><br><p>Adam might survive such an attack, but it would certainly make her victory much more likely.</p><br><p>“Your friend couldn’t dodge it, so you’re unlikely to be able to either. What’s more, there’s too little room to maneuver!” Bathild exclaimed inwardly, anticipating the sight of Adam’s blood flowing and the pain on his face.</p><br><br><br><p>Blood gushed out, flooding the dark, dust-covered stones.</p><br><p>However, Bathild didn’t smile. Only her eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br><p>The sharp tip completely pierced Adam’s palm, coming out the other side, but it couldn’t reach his torso because Adam had grabbed Bathild’s tail tightly, preventing it from moving.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A shiver ran through the tail as Bathild tried to pull it back, but she couldn’t.</p><br><p>“What? Did you think I didn’t have the guts to catch your tail?” Adam asked with a hint of arrogance. “Sorry to disappoint you.”</p><br><p>Bathild quickly found an advantage in her attack as her gaze fell on Adam’s palm. It wasn’t a small cut, but it was wide enough to practically split his hand in two.</p><br><p>If the tip had been a little wider, that’s exactly what would have happened.</p><br><p>“Hah, you stopped my tail, and now what? You can’t use your hand anymore, or you’ll lose it!”</p><br><p>Adam’s response was very simple—he raised the needle, staring intently at the weak connection in Bathild’s tail.</p><br><p>“In that case, I should take something from you too, right?”</p><br><p>Fearing the loss of her tail, Bathild quickly lunged forward, hoping to prevent Adam from doing so.</p><br><p>But that was exactly what he was counting on, as he was ready to replace the first needle with the second and create the lesser path.</p>
