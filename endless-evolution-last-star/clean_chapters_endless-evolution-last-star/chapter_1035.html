            <h4>Chapter 1035: Wrong Heart</h4><br><br><p>The Blood Reaper instantly jumped back, his sharp claws knocking sparks out of the rocks as a dangerous glint ran across his blades.
</p><br><p>The monster’s eyes twitched, staring at Adam in shock.
</p><br><p>The Blood Reaper couldn’t understand how he didn’t notice Adam’s approach. Moreover, the Blood Reaper felt almost nothing standing right in front of Adam. There was hardly any aura or energy fluctuations coming from him.
</p><br><p>But, one thing was certain - this was the enemy who had come with the other three.
</p><br><br><p>In a sharp jerk, the Blood Reaper was in front of Adam, cleaving with his blades. At the last moment, Adam leaned back, allowing the Blood Reaper’s blades to sweep over his head.
</p><br><p>"Oh, not bad, but..." Adam muttered, turning to face the monster. "You don’t seem to know how to talk, do you?"
</p><br><p>Thanks to his familiarity with Heret and Vorx, Adam found that while strength wasn’t a requirement for a monster to be able to talk, it was still often an important indicator.
</p><br><p>"Heret and Vorx are strong, and given their rules, you should be superior in strength to a normal serpent..." Adam muttered, trying to sort through his emotions.
</p><br><p>At the same time, the Blood Reaper’s jaw clenched as streams of blood rushed from his paws. In a few swings, the Blood Reaper unleashed a multitude of bloody blades at Adam, cleaving the ground.
</p><br><p>But, Adam only needed a few steps to the side to dodge the monster’s crushing attacks with precision and accuracy.
</p><br><p>"Hmm..." he hummed staring intently at the Blood Reaper, then transferring his gaze to Heret and Vorx.
</p><br><p>"How strange. Silvana, is this only happening to me?"
</p><br><p>’No...’ her voice trembled slightly. ’I can feel it too. Now that everyone has started fighting, it’s become obvious. There’s a completely different aura coming from that monster. It’s not like the one Arnoth had.’
</p><br><p>Adam felt it as well. No, in his case, the spectrum was much wider.
</p><br><p>Silvana wasn’t talking about the strength of the monster’s aura. It was obvious that the Blood Reaper was much weaker than Arnoth. His aura was different.
</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip. ’But, I can’t figure out what that means. Maybe all the Crucible Type monsters have a special aura because they have the External Artifact.’
</p><br><p>"No, that’s not the case here." Adam shook his head, dodging another of the Blood Reaper’s attacks.
</p><br><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes as fragments of the great battle flashed by.
</p><br><p>"Now that I’ve made the comparison, I can see it. The Crimson Monarch - he had the same aura. Somehow, I am deeply convinced that it was even deeper than Arnoth’s."
</p><br><p>Unfortunately, Adam didn’t fight against Kreyna. If he did, he would have more examples, but even so, he understood what it was all about.
</p><br><p>"The Hollow Wave monsters. Those two were the only ones I fought. All the monsters before were from the New Wave, right?"
</p><br><p>After a few moments, Silvana nodded deeply.
</p><br><p>’Judging from Arnoth’s words, that’s correct. You think that after you opened the Crystal Gates, you learned how to identify them?’
</p><br><p>"Well..." Adam jumped back, two blades passing in front of his calm eyes. "Looks like it. I’m almost a K4-Phantom already. Sooner or later, I’ll have to face the other Hollow Wave monsters, and... maybe even the Lords."
</p><br><p>To one degree or another, Adam understood what Arnoth was talking about before he died. The Dark Shore was unknown territory to him, but he knew it was further away and more dangerous than the Wild Lands.
</p><br><p>He didn’t have much information about the New Wave and the Hollow Wave, but he knew it had something to do with the age and origin of the monsters. Arnoth didn’t talk about it, but he had referred to the others as too young on numerous occasions.
</p><br><p>The only mystery to him was - the Lords.
</p><br><br><p>The Blood Reaper’s fangs slammed into the rock, right above Adam’s shoulders. The monster towered over him, glaring at Adam with anger.
</p><br><p>In the few minutes of their fight, the Blood Reaper had lost a lot of strength, but couldn’t even leave a scratch on Adam.
</p><br><p>"Lords..." Adam muttered, darkness filling his voice. "How strong are you? Are you the ones the K4-Phantoms are fighting against, or... are they even too weak for you?"
</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, gathering energy in his fist.
</p><br><p>Before the Blood Reaper could react, his punch plunged into the monster’s belly.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>A shudder rippled through the Blood Reaper’s body as Adam’s fist forced the monster to bend nearly double, crushing its flesh and breaking bones with his sheer physical force.
</p><br><p>Then, a pulse of energy shot out at a single point, causing the Blood Reaper to burst into shreds.
</p><br><br><p>Pieces of flesh like threads connected, the Blood Reaper trying to regenerate, being practically exploded. For a strong regenerative monster, even that was possible. The core of the Blood Reaper was the heart, all the strands held together only by it.
</p><br><p>Adam lunged forward, pulling the heart out of the Blood Reaper’s body. The monster’s flesh tried to resist, but Adam was too strong and fast.
</p><br><p>Sure, the Blood Reaper could still regenerate even without his heart.
</p><br><p>The scattered chunks of flesh trembled about to move closer together.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam’s aura surged, pressing the pieces of flesh together like a hundred-ton press. All that was left of the Blood Reaper were bloodstains and a trembling heart in Adam’s hand.
</p><br><p>"Well, let’s see if that’s enough." He frowned before opening his mouth and ripping off a large chunk, the other part he crushed.
</p><br><br><p>Adam swallowed the most powerful part of any regenerative monster, easily suppressing its energy within him.
</p><br><p>A light scratching echoed in his left arm. Adam turned, feeling the heat, his blood was ready to start regenerating.
</p><br><p>But before the wound could open, the process stopped.
</p><br><p>The Blood Reaper was not strong enough for its essence to be enough for Adam.
</p><br><p>"Agh... That was expected, right?"
</p><br><p>He sighed heavily and turned towards the lake.
</p><br><p>"Looks like I’ll have to take the essence. Something tells me it won’t be easy. It’s of great value to them, almost a treasure."</p>
