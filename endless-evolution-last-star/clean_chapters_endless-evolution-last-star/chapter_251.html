            <br><p>Some nights passed unnoticed, becoming just a convenient time to sleep to gain strength for the next day.</p><br><p>Sometimes, though, so much could happen in one night, in just a few hours, that many busy days seemed pale and dull.</p><br><p>One way or another, every night would end, the darkness would give way to dawn, and active life would begin, some would go to the academy, some to work, and some, went to Dead Lands.</p><br><p>Today, Adam didn't go to any of those places, he stood in front of the massive gates of the Miracle Observatory, waiting for Magnus to let them inside.</p><br><p>"Are you ready?" Silvana asked, looking at Adam, who for some reason, seemed strange to her today. He didn't say anything, only occasionally sighing heavily.</p><br><p>"Yeah..." Adam nodded, scratching the back of his head, "It's just... Last night wasn't what I expected, from Red Feast to my little trip..."</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip but didn't bother to ask anything else. If she was Adam's Operator, that didn't mean she had to know about his every move or action.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the doors opened, letting them inside.</p><br><p>This time there was no Nessa in front of the entrance, however, Magnus had prepared another guide for them - a drone hovering above the ground with a screen mimicking a smile.</p><br><p>As soon as the drone spotted them, it slowly headed forward, to the outer descent down to the lab instead of Magnus's specific house.</p><br><p>This place was where the room with the Crimson Sacrificer was, as well as many other doors and rooms with unknown things lurking in them. Only Magnus and Nessa had any information about it.</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that the Miracle Observatory was not just one big building, with Magnus often living and sleeping at the top and the actual laboratory starting at the bottom.</p><br><p>In addition to this building, there were other buildings in such a large area, but they were quite far away from the central one as if Magnus had deliberately separated himself from the other employees working at Miracle Observatory.</p><br><p>So, down to the main lab and following the drone, Adam and Silvana would occasionally run into other scientists, all of them in white coats and with serious looks. They only nodded at them, not stopping to waste their time.</p><br><p>Technically, they were all scientists working at Miracle Observatory, often they came to the main lab, occasionally returning to their buildings.</p><br><p>They were all considered scientists and were paid by the government, however... everyone realized that only Magnus could use that title to its fullest potential.</p><br><p>The government stayed out of Magnus's business, he had the power to do whatever he wanted as long as it yielded unique results.</p><br><p>However, building Miracle Observatory cost a huge sum, literally billions, so the territory, equipment, and technology had to be used to its maximum capacity, and for that, needed workers - other scientists and their assistants.</p><br><p>Naturally, Magnus handled his own projects, most of which only he and Nessa had access to. Magnus could go anywhere in Miracle Observatory, for it was his domain, while the other scientists could only visit their buildings and the main, underground laboratory, just certain parts of it.</p><br><p>That meant that Magnus had information about everything that went on at Miracle Observatory and could fire and hire whomever he wanted, in which he had complete freedom. Without his permission, other scientists couldn't even come into the central building or the closed parts of the underground lab.</p><br><p>All of this, one could say, was an enumeration of the reasons why all scientists, all who started their path of research, dreamed of reaching Magnus's level or any other free scientist.</p><br><p>Well... to do it simply through intelligence was simply impossible, something unique and crazy was required.</p><br><br><p>A door opened in front of Adam and Silvana, guiding them down a long hallway where there were no other scientists anymore, just emptiness and mysterious doors. A few turns away, there was a room with a Crimson Sacrificer and other doors that made Adam feel pressured and something eerie...</p><br><p>Reaching the next door, the drone turned around and flew away.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana glanced at each other before stepping forward.</p><br><p>"You're finally here." Nessa's calm voice sounded coming from the right. She, like Magnus beside her, was sitting in a chair.</p><br><p>It was a small room separated by sturdy glass from the spacious hall where there seemed to be only emptiness. Sure, it was unusual glass, and the material was from a monster so that Magnus and Nessa could be safe.</p><br><p>"Mr. Magnus, are you feeling well?" Silvana asked with a serious expression, for Magnus's face was even paler than usual, and there were massive bags under his eyes as if he hadn't slept at all.</p><br><p>Not that Silvana was worried about Magnus's condition, but he had to feel well for Adam's treatment to be successful.</p><br><p>Magnus smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"Nah, I just had a very interesting night, watching the same moment from my favorite movie over and over again." Magnus shrugged.</p><br><br><p>Nessa rolled her eyes as a slight annoyance appeared in her gaze.</p><br><p>"I'd rather you had this night to myself..." Nessa whispered, biting her finger with a great grimace.</p><br><p>Everyone heard her words, but they all chose to ignore it. After all, this was a private matter between her and Magnus.</p><br><p>"Anyway. Let's get started while Adam's genes are still active after last night's Red Feast. We're lucky the main course was the Thunder Demon you killed, it increases the chances of success." Magnus said with a slight smile before pressing a button, bringing up a hologram with a huge monster.</p><br><p>It could be called an improved version of the Crimson Sacrificer. Although the Crimson Sacrificer that Adam had fought earlier was Purple Threat Level and Prime One, that particular monster was rather weak among the other regenerative monsters of the Purple Threat Level.</p><br><p>The monster from the hologram was massive, clearly over four meters tall, its entire body covered in tough flesh, and on its chest, arms, and legs were crimson protective plates, as if made of flesh but much harder.</p><br><p>The monster's claws were long and wide like blades, from its broad back grew four outgrowths that moved, slowly as if looking for a target to pierce it with their sharp tips.</p><br><p>The monster's jaws were the strangest of all, massive with three rows of strong, sharp teeth like a shark's. The monster's four eyes placed opposite each other showed that it was impossible to sneak up on the monster unnoticed.</p><br><p>"This is Bladeclaw Beast, the strongest regenerative monster of the Purple Threat Level." Magnus calmly said, "There was no way I had the right situation to use it on some K1-Phantom, but for you to defeat such an opponent won't be a problem, even with one hand, right?"</p><br><p>Adam frowned slightly casting a glance at his left arm, his only arm so far. Sure, it had only been a couple of days since he had awakened, which was why Adam hadn't gotten used to not having a right hand yet, and he wasn't going to adjust to it!</p><br><p>"Fine, what do you want me to do? Should I catch that monster?"</p><br><p>Magnus grinned widely.</p><br><p>"Nah, he's been waiting a long time for his move. If you want to get your arm back, you're going to have to do something else."</p><br><p>Magnus pointed to Adam's chest.</p><br><p>"You must eat Bladeclaw Beast's heart!"</p>
