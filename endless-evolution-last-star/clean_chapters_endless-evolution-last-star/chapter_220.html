            <br><p>Resonance was the highest state that the Phantom could reach during battle. It most often appeared in deadly combat, but the true reason for it was something other than trivial danger.</p><br><p>The Phantom's desire to fight and conquer was the key element for the Phantom to reach the peak of its strength for a short period. Evolution Tree was actively shaking, forcing all of Phantom's genes to work at their maximum potential.</p><br><p>It could be compared to the adrenaline rush of an ordinary person, a hidden resource that couldn't be utilized for long, but Resonance was on a completely different level.</p><br><p>However, it was a dangerous power, leading to extreme exhaustion, so... Adam had to act fast.</p><br><br><p>Prago walked over to Adam and placed a hand on his shoulder.</p><br><p>"Good. I recognize you now." Prago smirked, then he turned to Fred, "Are you going to help us, or are you going to sit in the corner like a scared rat?"</p><br><p>Fred rolled his eyes and slowly stood up, kicking dust off his pants.</p><br><p>"Tsk. Like I have a choice. You come in here and ruin everything." Fred said irritably, but he was already clutching his bow tightly, preparing to attack.</p><br><p>"What's the plan here?" Adam asked, staring intently at Thunder Demon. Even though Prago was the strongest among them, it was obvious to everyone that Adam was going to fight Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>Prago scratched his chin, looking at the entire battlefield. Then, his gaze stopped on Tirana, who was still hiding behind the salt hill.</p><br><p>"Adam will take on Thunder Demon, you cover him." Prago pointed at Fred.</p><br><p>Fred nodded, but soon, he frowned since there were two other dangerous enemies besides Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>"What about Jade Lady and Obsidian Armadillo? I doubt they'll just stand by and watch us fight." Fred waved his hand.</p><br><br><p>"Don't worry. I'll take the Obsidian Armadillo on my own. You simply won't have the strength to penetrate its armor, that's for sure." Prago said.</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that just waiting it out wasn't a safe option.</p><br><p>Sooner or later, one of the three monsters would be exhausted, and then they would look for easy prey to regain their strength. Obviously, it will be Phantoms, which can be killed quickly and easily, because they are limited to the area of the anomalies cluster.</p><br><p>Therefore, Fred's plan was also risky, as everything depended on luck - whether the monsters would find them or not. However, attacking three monsters from the Top-5 was even riskier... there was no right solution in this situation.</p><br><p>"That only leaves Jade Lady, right?" Adam asked in a calm voice.</p><br><p>Prago nodded as a sly smirk appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"Yeah, don't worry. I'll take care of it. Not that I intend to fight against Obsidian Armadillo and Jade Lady at the same time, but you don't have to worry about that." Prago said confidently before leaping forward.</p><br><p>Prago waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Wait for my plan to come to action, then get started. You have a few minutes to gather your courage." Prago's last words sounded before he disappeared.</p><br><p>Adam and Fred glanced over, nodding to each other. They had worked together before, not 1 &amp; 1 but in a larger squad, but they knew what they were capable of.</p><br><p>'Adam...' Silvana muttered uncertainly. Never before had Adam spoken to her so roughly and powerfully at the same time. She had mixed feelings, figuring out which she didn't have time to sort out.</p><br><p>"I will fight Thunder Demon and take his Essence. You will assist me and tell me how I can kill him. Silvana, that is an order, is that clear to you?" Adam said sternly, leaving Silvana no other option but to obey.</p><br><p>An Operator who couldn't follow the direct orders of his Phantom was worse than garbage - this was told repeatedly to all Operators at the academy, it was an inviolable rule.</p><br><p>'But... Adam... That monster, Thunder Demon can actually kill you... I don't want you to risk your life again... You have a safer option...' Silvana muttered uncertainly. Adam's words had a profound effect on her, and she was not like herself.</p><br><p>"Silvana, you don't fight, you help. If I were to listen to you, I would run away even from Prime Stone Goliath. Only I know the full extent of what I am capable of because I can feel it." Adam said calmly, clenching his fist tightly and looking at his swollen veins.</p><br><br><p>"Shit, pull yourself together. I need you now, what happened to you? You're the Operator - you can give advice, and I can follow it or not, but if I give orders, you obey!"</p><br><p>Silvana gulped as a shiver went through her entire body along with a wave of shame. She herself felt that she was acting too emotional.</p><br><p>Silvana was ashamed because what Adam was saying was the basis of all the basics of the relationship between the Phantom and the Operator.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Adam sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"Don't worry. As always, I'll be the sword and you the mind. Deal?" Adam said slowly, his words seemed to penetrate directly into Silvana's soul.</p><br><p>Silvana ahhed as her eyes went wide. The trembling stopped, and she felt everything fall into place, the positions were clearly defined, which meant it was time to act!</p><br><p>'Yes. I understand you. I support whatever decision you make.' Silvana gathered her thoughts.</p><br><br><br><p>Adam was acting unemotional, but the reason wasn't Silvana or the situation, it was Resonance. His emotions were reduced to the extreme, leaving only seriousness, authority, and coldness in his voice.</p><br><p>'Although Thunder Demon surpasses you in strength, we can take advantage of his lack of seriousness and the fact that he only recently became an Essence Type. Given your abilities, we have a chance, but... there will be dire consequences. Listen to me carefully.' Silvana said seriously, quickly telling Adam her plan.</p><br><p>From time to time, Adam nodded, while his gaze grew deeper and darker. Soon, everything on the battlefield blurred and seemed to disappear, except for Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>Fred, who had been watching Adam all this time, nodded slightly. He had heard their conversation, only Adam's part of it, but he understood what it was about.</p><br><p>'Well... After all, we're not robots, relationships are a tricky thing, especially when, with every battle, your life could be on the line.' Fred mused as he closed his eyes, thinking of Mika, his Operator.</p><br><p>She was the most vulnerable and insecure person Fred knew, but her sincerity was impeccable.</p><br><p>'Fine, my confidence is enough for both of us. It's always about having someone to rely on, isn't it?' Fred smiled bitterly before grabbing his bow and getting into position.</p><br><p>Unlike Adam he didn't resonate, so he had to keep an eye on the whole battlefield at once.</p><br><p>Fred glanced at Adam, and a confident smirk appeared on his face.</p><br><p>'Well, last time it was you and Alexia against Top-4, North Keeper, now it's you and me against Top-2... Let's see what we can do.'</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Prago was approaching the three monsters, but strangely enough, he wasn't looking at Obsidian Armadillo, but at Jade Lady floating in the air.</p>
