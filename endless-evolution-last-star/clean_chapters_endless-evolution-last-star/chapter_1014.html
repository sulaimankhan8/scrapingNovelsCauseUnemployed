            <br><p>Every Phantom, even newcomers, knew that monsters were divided into Types. Most often, Phantoms would first encounter the Prime Type or the Essence Type monster.</p><br><p>If they survived and progressed further to K1 and K2 levels, they could encounter the Crown and Conqueror Type more and more often.</p><br><p>These were the four basic types, each had its unique features and distinctive traits, but they weren't the only types.</p><br><br><p>It was very rare for a K2-Phantom, but he faced an Overlord Type monster while at this level. In his case, it was a monster unknown to the Citadel - the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>Later, Adam learned that the Overlord Type was a combination of the Conqueror and the Crown types. The Crimson Monarch combined all the advantages of the two types while having the unique features of its type.</p><br><p>So... This caused Adam to ponder this a few times.</p><br><p>The Overlord Type combined the two types. Then, what did the Prime and the Essence Type combine?</p><br><p>He didn't have an answer.</p><br><p>He didn't know if there was another, sixth type that represented the same power as the Overlord Type.</p><br><p>Now, Adam got the answer to his question, although he didn't expect it to happen under these circumstances.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The dark golden armor, piece by piece, fell to the ground, partially revealing Arnoth's muscular body. Wounds covered his great frame, while the cracks continued to grow until they reached his helmet.</p><br><p>A few fragments chipped away, revealing his short blond hair and amber eyes, not normally human. Well, he wasn't a human after all.</p><br><p>But, Arnoth's appearance didn't interest Adam as much as his words, as much as what the energy behind him was turning into.</p><br><p>Adam was mesmerized by watching the maiden appear out of nowhere. She didn't have a physical shell, only energy created her image.</p><br><p>Her knee-length golden hair covered Arnoth's broad back in streams. Her eyes were closed with a slight smile on her face, her head nestled on Arnoth's shoulder.</p><br><p>The maiden said nothing, but from the way she embraced Arnoth, from the warmth with which she regarded him, it was obvious that to each other they were the most important souls in the world.</p><br><p>Then, Adam saw something he hadn't noticed before. He couldn't, because of Arnoth's armor and shield, but now he could clearly discern a faint light coming from Arnoth's chest.</p><br><p>A tattoo in gold ink flashed from time to time - a sharp shield in the embrace of two delicate maiden arms.</p><br><p>One part of the marking referred to Arnoth and the other to the unknown maiden.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Adam finally came to his senses, and his eyes went wide. Arnoth's words flashed through his mind.</p><br><p>"The Crucible Type...? It's..."</p><br><p>Arnoth smiled bitterly. "As you Phantoms believe... It's an expansion of the Prime and Essence types."</p><br><p>Slowly, Arnoth stood up, though he managed it with difficulty.</p><br><p>Not only was he able to block Adam's weak path of his second needle, but he managed to survive Adam's strongest attack.</p><br><p>Adam was sure that even if there were three, no, five monsters equal in strength to Kreyna against him, nothing could withstand his path.</p><br><p>Yet, Arnoth was still alive.</p><br><p>Moreover, only now has he revealed his true self. He had lost his shield and sword, his armor was shattered, but none of it was his power.</p><br><p>"Adam, you've come this far... I'm sure you want to understand who this is..." Arnoth pointed to the maiden who was hugging him tightly. "And, to find out what the power of the Crucible Type is."</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, Arnoth chuckled.</p><br><p>"Hah, you young men... Always curious. You want to learn all the secrets of the world as quickly as possible. Isn't it ironic that it is by receiving answers to our questions that we grow up? The more answers we have, the more we know, the more we want to go back to our younger years..."</p><br><p>Adam couldn't understand what Arnoth was talking about. After all, the difference in their ages was huge. Adam didn't know how old Arnoth was. But only someone who had lived in this world for decades could say such a thing.</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, Arnoth got to his feet. He gave himself a few seconds to get used to the forgotten sensations of bright pain and warm embrace.</p><br><p>"The Prime Type monsters..." he began. "You call those monsters the strongest among their kind. More often than not, it's the leader of a group or pack. With the Essence Type, it's even simpler - it's a monster that has merged with an artifact. Not just absorbed its energy, but took its essence and abilities."</p><br><br><br><p>He met his first Prime Monster only a few hours after becoming a Phantom. His first Essence Monster was the Thunder Demon. It was a great battle that contributed a part to his journey as a Phantom.</p><br><p>"So..." Arnoth continued. "I guess you won't argue that I'm strong enough to be the strongest in my group, among other monsters of a similar kind."</p><br><br><p>"But, if we're talking about an artifact. There's a change here. The Crucible Type and the Overlord Type aren't just a combination of other, weaker types. It's also something new, something that gives us our special power."</p><br><p>Adam shuddered. "The path you went through, right?"</p><br><p>With a slight smile, Arnoth confirmed.</p><br><br><br><p>Arnoth stepped forward. Without his sword, shield, and heavy armor, his footsteps no longer caused him to tremble.</p><br><p>However, he looked much stronger. Adam could feel it.</p><br><p>He could see the previously restrained energy slowly flooding Arnoth's body. Apparently, the silent maiden was the main reason for this, as well as the golden mark on Arnoth's chest.</p><br><br><p>He held out his hand in acknowledgment and respect.</p><br><p>"Let me introduce you to someone important to me."</p><br><p>Shining like the sun thanks to streams of golden energy, Arnoth pointed to the maiden.</p><br><p>"This is my External Artifact - Lost Light."</p><br><p>Now, the origin of Arnoth's title was clear.</p><br><p>"The two of us will be happy to break your soul down to the last fiber of your being - Adam Vinter."</p>
