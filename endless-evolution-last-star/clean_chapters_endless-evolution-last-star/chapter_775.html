            <br><p>Nearly half a minute passed since the Crimson Monarch's last words, yet neither moved.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch couldn't get used to the fact that Adam wasn't afraid, his arrogance and majesty prevented him from considering Adam an equal.</p><br><p>Adam threw his head back slightly. Flames continued to sweep before his eyes. His aura protected Lone Blaze's fire. Without Adam's confidence, Lone Blaze would be scared to death.</p><br><p>"Why aren't you attacking? Go ahead, I've waited for this battle long enough to want to charge at you like a wild hound. But..."</p><br><p>Coldness abruptly filled Adam's eyes, cruel ice directed at the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>"It would be rude of me to make the first move after what you said, wouldn't it?"</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch frowned, his menacing aura had no effect on Adam whatsoever, on the contrary, it allowed Adam to use the Crimson Monarch's words against him.</p><br><p>"You're right, that would be inappropriate..." he said in a low voice, "I am the Monarch, you must deal with my servants first."</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam turned to the side, looking at the monsters hiding behind rubble and massive columns.</p><br><p>"Are you talking about them? I'm afraid you overestimate them. If they could they would have stopped me, it was impossible for them before, now it's definitely beyond their capabilities."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch narrowed his eyes. He could feel how active Adam's energy was, it was new.</p><br><p>"I see... You've only recently become stronger, yet you're trying to act on the same level as me? Furthermore..."</p><br><p>After a moment, the Crimson Monarch added:</p><br><p>"You're young, you're new to the battlefield, aren't you? Though your eyes are cold, your blood is hot, it's boiling with the desire to rush into battle, to explore the dangerous world, right?"</p><br><p>There was no reply, but the Crimson Monarch wasn't expecting it, his questions were rhetorical, he understood everything from Adam's stare.</p><br><p>"I'm afraid your ignorance of what monsters like me are capable of will bring you to your doom."</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Crimson Monarch swung his arm, directing some of his energy toward the monsters.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, drops of blood formed in the air, smashing into the monsters' bodies and heads, into every available area of their bodies, leaving a crimson seal in the shape of a serpent reaching for its tail in a circle.</p><br><p>In the blink of an eye, all the monsters' wounds disappeared, their bodies grew stronger, and their auras increased as fast as possible.</p><br><p>Some of them changed, like the Vile Believers' two arms, and their spears grew longer with wide scarlet tips.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils dilated, the Crimson Monarch's energy not only made them stronger but allowed a few to evolve even if it was temporary.</p><br><p>Then, Adam realized a little more about his opponent, and his theory was confirmed by Silvana who recovered from the shock and dealt with her fear. It was hard for her to just stare at the Crimson Monarch through shared sighs.</p><br><p>'Adam, I hope you can hear me... This monster isn't a Crown Type, it's the Overlord Type, I don't know what kind of monster it is, its name isn't in the database, there's no one like it, but I know a lot about the Overlord Type...'</p><br><p>Silvana gulped as she continued:</p><br><p>'We don't have much time, so to summarize, the Overlord Type is an enhanced version of the Conqueror and the Crown Types. The two types in one with extra features.'</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, some of this he understood on his own, especially after the Crimson Monarch made his first move.</p><br><p>'Hm... I thought there were only four types, but it seems I was wrong. The Conqueror Type and the Crown Type, what an unpleasant and dangerous combination. I should be careful.'</p><br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch stepped forward, Adam's instincts demanded that he prepare to attack, but his mind saw and controlled everything. The Crimson Monarch was not going to attack, at least not with his hands.</p><br><p>"Goodbye Adam VInter, I will leave you here, forever. I promise no one will disturb your eternal sleep."</p><br><p>Before Adam could comprehend anything, he turned into stone.</p><br><p>The motionless statue reflected in the purple snake's amber eyes, the bright glow that caused Adam to petrify slowly weakened.</p><br><p>Then, the Crimson Monarch waved his hand, one amber glare from the snake was enough to turn even a Phantom as strong as Adam into stone. He wouldn't be able to do it from a distance, so he purposely got close enough.</p><br><p>Following their ruler's gesture, a multitude of monsters darted ahead. Their silhouettes shuddered, turning into shadows, in a heartbeat, ending up around Adam.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch did not move away or say anything. He silently watched the imminent execution of his first enemy upon awakening.</p><br><p>Only when it was complete, and the monsters fulfilled his order he would move to the next target - the Crimson Monarch would come to the surface.</p><br><br><p>Cutting through the wind currents, the spears and the Thirst Redeemers' long legs came down on Adam, about to pierce him from all sides, the stone shell would not be a barrier to them, but would prevent Adam from even twitching a finger.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's eyelids grew heavier, covering his eyes with a dark curtain.</p><br><p>"The fire burning within you is hot, yet you should try to run, train for years, and then find me to offer a decent fight. Instead, you chose such an inglorious death."</p><br><p>Soon, he opened his eyes.</p><br><br><p>His pupils went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>The spears and long, sharp legs of the massive monsters had pierced the stone layer as expected, but Adam was uninjured.</p><br><p>In a rush, the Crimson Monarch's eyes grew deeper, eager to see what was happening beneath the cover.</p><br><p>Thick energy filled Adam's entire body, concentrating in a thin layer near his skin, his organs were in a vulnerable position, but his skin became harder than steel, uniting with the dense energy.</p><br><p>"What... magnificent energy control..."</p><br><p>At the Crimson Monarch's praise, Adam's fingertips twitched, the stone prison weakening due to the damage.</p><br><p>In the blink of an eye, he was free from his dungeon, a white flash of flame turned the monsters into burning chunks of flesh flying before his eyes along with the splinters.</p><br><p>"Thanks for not leaving."</p><br><p>Adam's deep voice rang out along the temple.</p><br><p>"I won't need to catch up with you, now it's my turn, right?"</p>
