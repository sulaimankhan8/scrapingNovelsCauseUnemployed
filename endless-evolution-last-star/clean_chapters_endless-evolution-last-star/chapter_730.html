            <br><br><p>A multitude of Phantoms turned around as a green flash illuminated the dark lands around the fortress. Viron and Gnash were among them.
</p><br><p>Gnash frowned heavily, covering herself with her hand from the unpleasant glow, she realized that it boded them nothing but trouble.
</p><br><p>"What kind of bastard did this? Fuck! We’ve already got several waves of monsters coming at us, we’ve already killed hundreds, but someone didn’t think that was enough?!"
</p><br><p>Unlike her, Viron was more calm, but even his gaze became more serious. No matter how confident he was, he wasn’t naive enough to think that the Eclipse would pass without casualties, someone would die and it would probably be someone from his squad.
</p><br><p>The more casualties there were, the greater the chance that someone he cared about would get hurt, the number of casualties was directly related to the number of monsters.
</p><br><p>It didn’t matter how strong the two armies were, the difference in strength could be zero or significant, but there would always be those who were less fortunate than others.
</p><br><p>"Yeah... It looks like some chaotic monster came here. I don’t know how it is for others, but they’ve always annoyed me more than others."
</p><br><p>Gnash raised an eyebrow in confusion.
</p><br><p>"Chaotic monster? What do you mean?"
</p><br><p>"Well..." Viron shrugged slightly, trying to find a suitable explanation, "The ones who aren’t looking for killing or peaceful solutions, they aren’t resource hunters and yet they certainly can’t be described as calm dormant threats that simply absorb energy from the environment for future evolution."
</p><br><p>Viron was silent for a few seconds, an idea soon coming to him.
</p><br><p>"Considering how you follow Adam Vinter, you probably know about all his fights, right?"
</p><br><p>Gnash nodded uncertainly. She didn’t like the way Viron described it, but he was right.
</p><br><p>"In that case, you should know about his fight against the Essence Thunder Demon. I know about it since I was also looking for a suitable Essence Monster for myself at that time. So... these are the kind of monsters I call chaotic monsters, although there are some among humans as well."
</p><br><p>After a few seconds Viron continued, he fell silent as he was contacted by his Operator, relaying the current information about the Grim Warro.
</p><br><p>"They don’t care if it brings them closer to victory or makes it harder, they have only one goal - to enjoy themselves."
</p><br><p>Then, Viron clenched his fists tightly, as if remembering something from the deep past that should preferably have been forgotten forever.
</p><br><p>"Because of such bastards... for the sake of having moments of joy, others get lives full of suffering..." Your next read awaits at NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><br><p>"Ghahaha! Ghahaha! Ghahaha!"
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Viron was right, as the Grim Warro fully understood what he did, he was actively laughing enjoying the chaos that he created.
</p><br><p>The roots absorbed energy from the crystals, feeding the black tree to keep the green flame beam reaching the dark clouds.
</p><br><p>During the Eclipse, when only a small, faded portion of the moonlight remained, such bright fire was a dazzling star that would show the way to anyone willing to follow, whether Phantom or monster.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Two bright purple flashes lit up the second and third towers, the One-Eyed Serpent Archers were not pleased with this outcome. The more monsters the harder it would be to defend the fortress, so they had to destroy the black tree at all costs.
</p><br><p>Obviously, the Grim Warro didn’t want it to end so quickly. Every second the flames were burning attracted new monsters, but could he stop the archers’ devastating shots?
</p><br><br><p>With a snickering sigh, the Grim Warro ran forward, in a heartbeat he turned into a shadow moving at a speed beyond the capabilities of most K2-Phantoms.
</p><br><p>Before the archers could fire, the Grim Warro was already in front of the tree, about to defend his creation.
</p><br><br><p>The two bowstrings twitched, simultaneously releasing purple arrows straight into the black tree.
</p><br><p>The Grim Warro’s smirk grew wider as his fingers trembled, releasing streams of flame.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Under the pressure, the flames turned into two bright stars, unstable and dangerous, they couldn’t stay stable for long, but the Grim Warro didn’t need much time.
</p><br><br><p>Acting on instinct, not caring to calculate, the Grim Warro swung his arms, throwing the spheres towards the arrows.
</p><br><p>As one would expect, the trajectory was wrong, in a second the arrows would just fly over the spheres without hitting them, but... this also caused the spheres to crash into each other before time.
</p><br><br><p>A deafening explosion of green flames amplified by the local energy spread around, the shockwaves sent ripples through the sand joined by powerful wind currents fleeing away from the epicenter.
</p><br><p>The purple arrows were strong enough to withstand the explosion happening near them, but it greatly affected their trajectory.
</p><br><p>Thus, after a moment, the arrows collapsed into the hill behind the black tree.
</p><br><p>A new wave of tremors rippled through the ground, the sand piled up in waves, tearing down the monsters in its path, yet the Grim Warro and the black tree remained unharmed.
</p><br><p>"Kha... Kha... Kha..."
</p><br><p>The Grim Warro smirked contentedly, feeling his victory in this round.
</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a quick, gliding sound came from the south side like the smooth shot of an experienced sniper.
</p><br><p>Before the Grim Warro could realize anything, a jet of dense water pierced through the black tree.
</p><br><br><p>The Grim Warro indignantly looked up, the fires in his eyes wavering, he was confused.
</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.
</p><br><p>Three more high-speed water jets slammed into the black tree, shattering it into splinters, faster than the Grim Warro could defend it.
</p><br><p>Katrin blinked several times, not believing her eyes.
</p><br><br><p>She turned to the south looking at the creature hovering over the hill. Three white disks were spinning around a water sphere, fast-flowing water under heavy pressure, not stopping for a second.
</p><br><p>Inside the sphere was a drop-shaped creature with a pale blue slimy body, next to it were three azure spheres of dense energy.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The spheres trembled, then three fierce jets of water launched, almost instantly reaching the black tree, destroying it to its very core.
</p><br><p>Behind this creature were many similar ones, but they had one to two rings and spheres.
</p><br><p>This was the Essence Silent Droao, and unlike the Prime Grim Warro, it didn’t want any extra attention, the Silent Droao came here with a clear purpose - to absorb all available energy.
</p><br><p>"Fuck..." Katrin gulped as she instinctively turned towards the last direction - east.
</p><br><p>She saw the dark clouds gradually turning red and filling with flames, long shadows flickering among them, eager to take their rightful place on the battlefield.</p>
