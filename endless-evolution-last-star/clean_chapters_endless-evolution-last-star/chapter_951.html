            <br><p>The Artifact and the Elemental Root were important parts of the Phantom's power, and each granted the Phantom some sort of ability. Sometimes it was only a passive effect, other times the Phantom could use his artifact or root actively.</p><br><p>However, it was still not at a level to compare with the two orders, power gene or initial gene. The Elemental Root was not part of the Evolution Tree, it was close and making attempts to fuse into one, but it was still two separate entities.</p><br><p>The Artifact was always separate. That wasn't a problem, Adam had won quite a few fights thanks to the abilities of his artifact, but... it wasn't its final form. It wasn't just Adam who was evolving but all the components of his powers.</p><br><p>Now, the two beings left alone in Adam's inner space could watch the formation of the Foundation Artifact.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes were closed, and he quickly disappeared from his inner space since his work was done.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the Horn of Fallen Thunder and the Elemental Root collided, transforming into a small round object that could easily fit on a man's head, like a piece of jewelry or proof of great power.</p><br><p>A black wreath, not of olive branches but of thorns, floated serenely in the darkness.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze gulped as she stepped forward, her hand outstretched, wanting to touch the wreath.</p><br><br><p>The electrical discharge caused Lone Blaze to back away, leaving a light but noticeable burn on her palm.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Lone Blaze's eyes went wide in disbelief. "That's a burn...? How can that be?"</p><br><p>Moira shuddered. She didn't want to show it but she didn't know what was going on.</p><br><p>"Shit..." Moira muttered with a deep look. "You want to tell me that this artifact immediately shows that it is above us in the hierarchy? That's not fucking fair!"</p><br><p>[Hehehe... Girls, what you're watching is a dangerous thing... The Foundation Artifact that Adam created... Hah... He got everything and nothing at the same time...]</p><br><p>Unlike Lone Blaze or Moira, the Evolution Tree was in high spirits. It wasn't going to hold back its curiosity and channeled some energy directly into the wreath, wanting to see what Adam's Foundation Artifact was capable of.</p><br><br><p>A lone wreath that wants to see blood and show before making its move. Once that happens, the proud owner of the wreath can get what he desires, one time for one worthy sight...]</p><br><p>[Hmm... Honestly, I was expecting something more specific...]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree muttered in a low voice before looking at the baffled Lone Blaze and Moira.</p><br><p>[You two... Return at the Initial Gene... I'm expending energy to make up for your absence... Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but now Adam might need every drop of his strength...]</p><br><p>Lone Blaze and Moira nodded. They understood the seriousness of the situation and wanted to help Adam, but Lone Blaze couldn't contain her desire and asked.</p><br><p>"What is this Foundation Artifact capable of? What should we expect? This information could be useful if Adam uses our powers to the maximum..." she muttered uncertainly.</p><br><p>[Unfortunately... I don't know any more than you do... We can only watch... How Adam will activate his Foundation Artifact...]</p><br><p>Moira blinked several times in confusion. "Wait... That means he knows what his new artifact can do, right?"</p><br><p>[Heh... Sure he is... After all, he created it right in front of your eyes.]</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Adam watched the fiery pillars of the explosion rise to the top of the cave.</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent was hitting full force, his anger for the lost eye was real and burning. If Adam hadn't evaded at the last moment, chunks of his burned flesh would be floating among the magma puddles.</p><br><p>Risha and the Inferno Serpent stared at Adam as if petrified. His energy and aura grew much stronger, a result of the breaking of the third lesser gates.</p><br><p>Adam had only two lesser gates left to open before he could create the Third Key and become a K4-Phantom, and he had gone most of the way as a K3-Phantom.</p><br><p>For Risha, this was a big blow and a reason to rejoice at the same time. Now, she thought Adam stood a chance against the unusually strong S4 monster, but right before her eyes, Adam took a step forward, even though without this enhancement, he was superior to her in every way.</p><br><p>'Shit... My brother told me about the Foundation Artifact a long time ago, but... no matter how hard I try, I can't get the artifact and my Elemental Root to move! It takes a lot of energy, too much!'</p><br><p>She clenched her fists tightly, wanting to know Adam's secret.</p><br><p>'My Evolution Tree and the power of my desires are not enough. Did he get lucky, or... did he purposely hold back his artifact and Elemental Root to create the Foundation Artifact at the right moment? No... I don't believe that...'</p><br><p>Risha shook her head, unwilling to accept the thought. 'Adam is certainly an impressive fighter, but he's nothing like my brother. I've known him for a while, but thinking a hundred steps ahead is definitely not his style...'</p><br><p>With a stare, the Inferno Serpent leaned forward, their gazes meeting Adam's.</p><br><p>''Adam Vinter... What is this...? You got stronger right now, and... What's that weapon on your head?"</p><br><p>In response, Adam smirked, pointing to his wreath.</p><br><p>"This?" he chuckled. "Don't worry about it too much. It's something new. However, you'll have to wait a bit before you see what my new artifact can do."</p><br><p>"Wait...?" the Inferno Serpent wheezed, curiosity audible in his voice. "How long? I want to erase you and get my eye back faster..."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly. "Well, that depends on how long you can hold out against me."</p><br><p>"Agh...?" the Inferno Serpent was lost.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Adam's aura intensified as he channeled energy to his feet, enough to make the ground beneath him crackle, preparing to lunge forward.</p><br><p>Feeling the fluctuations in energy, the first of the many thorns on his wreath shone brightly, sparking in purple electrical discharges.</p>
