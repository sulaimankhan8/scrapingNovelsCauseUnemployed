            <br><p>Every mission has an ending, even the sudden and dangerous survival of the Eclipse.</p><br><p>Every hour fighters flew in and out of the Citadel, some just going on the day's mission and some returning.</p><br><p>The Phantoms usually used one or two fighters, the second option would only be needed if the squad was quite large.</p><br><p>However, even among the military, it was rare to see more than three fighters return to the Citadel at once.</p><br><p>Now, the military on the runway in the morning could see that event.</p><br><p>The fighters full of sleeping Phantoms slowly landed, their engines burning blue gradually fading as if the pilots were trying not to disturb their sleep.</p><br><p>The military men looked at each other, slightly confused.</p><br><p>As the fighters landed, everyone felt a strange tension, it was obvious that the fighters had not picked up the Phantoms after a successful mission.</p><br><p>The ramps lowered, letting out a squad of military personnel. They had to wake up the Phantoms, they had no other choice, but even the military behaved cautiously, instead of the usual seriousness and rudeness that was necessary every day in their dangerous job.</p><br><br><p>Something touched Adam's shoulder, forcing him out of sleep. He was still standing against the wall, his arms crossed, but his eyes tightly closed.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyelids lifted, seeing one of the military in front of him.</p><br><p>"Mr. Adam, we're back at the Citadel."</p><br><p>The military man hesitated for a moment.</p><br><p>"I think you should get some rest, you and all the others... survived a terrible night."</p><br><p>Drowsy, Adam looked away, the Phantoms, one by one, exiting the fighter. Now, it was over.</p><br><p>With a slight nod, Adam stepped forward as he patted the military man on the shoulder.</p><br><p>"Thank you, that was actually a momentous night..."</p><br><p>Despite Adam's words he was immersed in thought, a lot of things were bothering him regarding Moira and the Second Key, thus he walked past Gnash, forgetting that she was even near him.</p><br><p>It wasn't about Gnash, since Adam hadn't remembered about Katrin who got out of the other fighter just a few seconds after him.</p><br><p>No sooner had Katrin reached him than he blended into the crowd, heading down the elevator with the others, a few more steps, and he would be inside the Citadel, within the walls.</p><br><p>Soon, Gnash awoke as well. She hoped to see Adam beside her, but he was gone. She ran out of the fighter, but by then Adam was left.</p><br><p>"What...? Did I sleep too long? But... didn't we all get woken up?!"</p><br><p>Sadness covered Gnash's face, she didn't know what she should do now.</p><br><p>Suddenly, from outside came a calm, confident voice as always:</p><br><p>"And? Why didn't you do it?"</p><br><p>Gnash turned around abruptly only to see Viron. His green eyes were deep and piercing, it seemed that fatigue had not affected him.</p><br><p>She narrowed her eyes intently, looking at Viron.</p><br><p>"What, what the hell are you talking about?"</p><br><p>Viron tilted his head, his arms crossed over his chest.</p><br><p>"Why didn't you ask him out?"</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Gnash's face turned red, as a tomato, embarrassment surged over her in a wave.</p><br><p>"What the hell are you talking about?! I never had any such thoughts...!"</p><br><p>Viron didn't try to change her mind, he just continued to glare at her. He knew he was right, and soon Gnash realized that she couldn't hide her motives from Viron.</p><br><p>After a few seconds her defenses dissolved as she glanced away, muttering something:</p><br><p>"I'm just afraid... I'm following him so I'd know if he was dating someone at the moment, he's single, but... I have a feeling he's not looking for a relationship right now."</p><br><p>"Just try it, it's much better than spending days or weeks thinking about a missed opportunity."</p><br><p>Biting her lip Gnash nodded deeply. She turned around about to say something, but... Viron vanished. He just disappeared like a ghost.</p><br><p>Gnash turned around, but she still couldn't figure out where he went.</p><br><p>"Shit... What's wrong with him?"</p><br><p>Gnash lowered her gaze, feeling ashamed of her indecision.</p><br><p>"Though, I have to admit he's right... I wish I'd said everything back in the fighter."</p><br><p>After a few minutes had passed, she was the only Phantom left, well... almost the only one:</p><br><p>"I have a question."</p><br><p>Katrin's serious voice brought Gnash out of her musings.</p><br><p>"Agh...? Are you still here?"</p><br><p>"Sure, I'm in no hurry to go anywhere unlike the rest of you. Screw the daily missions, I'm taking a break. Hah, at least until I feel like getting my External Artifact."</p><br><p>Confusion reflected in Gnash's eyes. She was K2W0-Phantom after all, she became considerably farther away from Adam and Katrin over this night than she had been yesterday.</p><br><p>"What's the question...? What do you want to know?"</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Katrin said:</p><br><p>"Are you in love with Adam, or are you just a fan of him?"</p><br><p>Gnash was petrified, she didn't know what to say. Katrin stumped her even more than Viron because she could see a little more since she was also a woman.</p><br><p>Without waiting for Gnash's response, Katrin waved her hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"If the first one then go ahead and try to win his heart, with sincere love you will succeed. However, if it's the second, you should think twice about your decision."</p><br><p>Then, Katrin moved away from their topic, speaking of her own.</p><br><p>"The stronger I get, the more events I experience as a Phantom, the more experienced I become, the more I realize that the ban on Phantom/Operator relationships is a load of crap."</p><br><br><p>Katrin walked next to Gnash, looking at her over her shoulder.</p><br><p>"If you're just a fan, if you like to watch his triumphs but not him, then you're only going to fail on the love side, because you've fallen in love not with him but with his image, like a fan at a celebrity. You should act only in the first option, otherwise what chance do you have against Silvana?"</p><br><p>Gnash flinched, she knew who Silvana was.</p><br><p>Before Katrin could get out of her sight, Gnash threw her arm forward, her eyes wide.</p><br><p>"You... What is your relationship with your Operator?"</p><br><p>Katrin smiled slyly, giving her one last glance.</p><br><p>"Hah, tell you everything. It's none of your business what I do with my lump of cuteness at home."</p><br><p>Then, Katrin walked away, leaving Gnash alone on the runway, immersed in her thoughts, a storm of emotions.</p>
