            <br><p>"Your mint, strawberry, and vanilla ice cream! Please enjoy and come to our company at Second and First Ring!" The sales girl said with a bright smile on her face.</p><br><p>Then, she started making ice cream for another prisoner, who was ready to pick up ten servings at once.</p><br><p>"Looks like this place is pretty popular." Adam muttered, looking at the prisoners that occasionally approached this stall.</p><br><p>"Sure, but honestly... their ice cream is pretty damn expensive. When I was a K0-Phantom, it took me a long time to get to the income level where my heart wouldn't break from the pain of paying for a single ice cream cone." Edir said with a heavy sigh. read-first-at-NovelBin</p><br><p>It was obvious that despite the endless smirks, the taunts, and the fact that he hid his power, Edir had gotten where he was through a thorny path and not by luck or someone else's help.</p><br><p>Adam understood him, just as he realized that not all Phantoms were millionaires and incredibly rich just because they were Phantoms.</p><br><p>K0-Phantom, who had just started his journey and usually didn't show incredible results on the first missions could certainly afford to live in the First Ring, but a businessman with two or three bakeries was wealthier.</p><br><p>However, the owners of large corporations and companies were richer even than K2, K3, and K4-Phantoms, but at this level, it was not so important.</p><br><p>Money and influence could give power, but... what was the point when a single K4-Phantom was strong enough to destroy an entire neighborhood and hundreds of experienced military personnel?</p><br><p>The only way ordinary people could allow themselves to fight the Phantoms was if they were protected by other Phantoms, which the Proud Wing under the auspices of Azure Lotus did.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes widened slightly as he, only now, realized that everything in Fall Hill Prison was free.</p><br><p>"Okay, let's cut to the chase." Edir said as his gaze became serious, and his aura became slightly more powerful.</p><br><br><p>"When you fought Trana and Krana, an Aura Seal appeared over your Evolution Tree, and you were also able to use The Will, the general name for the power of the aura."</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>"What about the needle? Previously, I was attacked with blades, just like you with the ghost axe. This is the first stage, isn't it?"</p><br><p>Adam realized that the power had to grow in stages, so he needed to find out how to advance further.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you're right. This stage doesn't have an official name, but we prefer to call the first stage of Spirit - Weapon."</p><br><p>"Spirit...?" Adam asked, puzzled.</p><br><br><p>"Your needle, my axe, Trana and Krana's creepy ghosts, and even Prago's flower monster are all Spirits. The shape of your Spirit is inside the Aura Seal. Well, I think that was obvious without me saying so."</p><br><p>Adam ate his ice cream in silence for a while with a thoughtful look.</p><br><p>Then, without taking his eyes off the process he asked:</p><br><p>"How do I reach the next stage? At first, I thought only a K2-Phantom like Prago could do it, but Trana and Krana have done it as well as you..."</p><br><p>Adam hadn't seen Edir's second stage Spirit yet, but he had full confidence in Edir's abilities. Moreover, Edir himself had indirectly confirmed it earlier.</p><br><p>Edir sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"It... it's not that simple. I mean, you should have noticed by now that unlike Evolution Tree, Nexus, or Artifact, The Will has no clear terms, no actions, no resources, nothing."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide as he quickly immersed himself in the inner space.</p><br><p>He glanced at the Aura Seal, flew up, and touched it, but nothing happened. There was no way he could affect the circle or the needle hovering in the center. It seemed like it was all static, and didn't have a connection to him.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah... it's a little weird." Adam muttered, opening his eyes.</p><br><p>"To strengthen your Spirit, you must go through an even more serious battle than against Krana and Trana, where the big bet will be on your aura. Many in my position would not advise you to do so until K2." Edir said, by the last words, his voice had grown cold and hard.</p><br><p>Adam cast a hard stare at him.</p><br><p>"Why? You did it, even Krana and Trana did it. Not that I'm diminishing their merit, but both of them lost to me, so obviously I stand above them in strength."</p><br><p>Edir, with a slight smile, waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Hehehe, it's not that you're weak or can't handle it, it's the risks. I think you fully felt how much pressure it is on your body to create an Aura Seal and summon your Spirit. You endured it and were able to keep fighting, that's really impressive. It shows that your strength and endurance are at a high level."</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a serious look.</p><br><p>His Elemental Root, Power Gene, and Natural Origin had a significant effect on his physical stats and damage resistance.</p><br><p>"But... The second stage of the Spirit... that's a different matter. I can't know that for sure, but I am confident that Trana and Krana did it slowly and for a very long time."</p><br><p>"Hahaha, the pressure from the abrupt transition from first stage to second stage Spirit would have broken all their bones and ripped their flesh apart!" Edir smirked, about to continue eating the ice cream, but... it had already melted.</p><br><br><p>Edir jumped over the booth and scooped a few balls of ice cream. The sales girl was shocked, looking at him in disbelief, but she didn't say anything.</p><br><p>"Anyway, given your skills and fighting style you're used to doing everything through mortal combat. That's commendable, but it also means there's a risk of serious injury if you awaken a second stage at an unfortunate moment." Edir nonchalantly explained, looking at the mountain of ice cream balls.</p><br><p>He smiled and whispered, 'Hah, that's the one!'</p><br><p>Adam rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p><br><p>"So... either long training and gradually reaching the second stage or sudden progress in a dangerous fight, but... If I'm not ready for it, the pressure will just break me, literally. Am I saying this right?"</p><br><br><br><p>Edir paused, a smirk appearing on his face.</p><br><p>"I did it during the fight, but... I got lucky, in a way. My opponent was dangerous, but I could dodge all the attacks, however, if I had made a mistake even once, I would have taken critical damage. Thus, my body was not weakened by wounds and cuts, and I was able to successfully survive the pressure from the second stage."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, pondering the options.</p><br><p>Sure, he wanted to do it during the battle, not just because it was something common for him but because he was placing a big bet on his Elemental Root.</p><br><p>'Hmph... my Elemental Root possesses a gravitational element. If I understand it correctly, it should help me deal with the pressure if it's of the physical type. Damn, it's complicated...'</p><br><p>"Watch out!" Lola shouted, looking at Edir, who opened his mouth wide, swallowing several ice cream balls from his tower at once.</p><br><p>Then, he took another bite and another with ease, eating the whole thing.</p><br><p>"Alright. It's time to fill the cells, but... who will be my first victim?" Edir smirked, casting a glance at the woman drinking wine and oysters.</p><br><p>She smiled slyly, clearly ready for his challenge.</p>
