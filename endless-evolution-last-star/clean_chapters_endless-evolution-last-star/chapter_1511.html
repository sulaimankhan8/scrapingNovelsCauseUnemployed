            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1511: Frozen Spine (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>After Alexia’s throw, the second white beast did not rush to counterattack. As Adam had previously suggested, their goal was not to kill the two Phantoms but to find out what they were capable of.</p><br><p>This was their forest, so they could not allow anyone weak, basically unworthy, to be on its territory.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>The second white beast rose and emerged from under the broken branches. It glanced at Alexia and snorted loudly, but that was all.</p><br><p>It was obvious to everyone that if Alexia could lift and throw such a heavy monster, then if they fought a deadly battle, Alexia would be the winner.</p><br><br><p>Adam moved forward. Deep down, he was curious to see if he could lift the white beast, if he had enough physical strength to do the same thing Alexia did.</p><br><p>But he didn’t want to copy her and waste time. First, they had to get to Frost Ridge, where the abyss awaited them.</p><br><p>Their energy led them there, so this forest was a temporary stop.</p><br><p>“Hmm, if it weren’t for that ice wyvern, we would have fallen before the Frost Ridge, between the forest and the mountains. Did it throw us here on purpose, or was it an accident?”</p><br><p>“Pfffft!” The first white beast snorted as hot steam came out of its nostrils.</p><br><p>The white beast was about to pounce on Adam, but when a bright light shot from Adam’s hand, the beast’s eyes widened.</p><br><p>The monster sensed the impending threat, but was not quick enough to react.</p><br><p>Adam’s frame trembled as he blurred right in front of the white beast.</p><br><p>The long white needle was right in front of the beast’s right eye. All Adam had to do was reach forward with his hand, and their battle would be over.</p><br><p>“Hey, that should be enough, right?” Adam asked with a slight smile.</p><br><p>The beast couldn’t answer, but he could see that the monster sighed with relief.</p><br><p>“Rgh!” The white beast jerked its head and headed into the depths of the forest. His buddy followed him.</p><br><p>There was nothing left for them to do here. Not anymore.</p><br><br><br><p>“I was expecting much more! And what is that?” She pointed at Adam’s needle. ” You still use the same weapon?”</p><br><p>In response, he shrugged.</p><br><p>“Strangely enough, of all the forms my needle has taken, this is the closest to the first one. However, you haven’t seen the true power of this needle.”</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam’s right eye turned green as the darkness emanating from the edges of his needle grew thicker.</p><br><p>For some reason, a chill ran down Alexia’s spine. All her instincts told her that she would not want to fight Adam when he was in this state.</p><br><br><p>With a snap of his finger, the needle shattered into fragments, flying past Adam’s eyes.</p><br><p>“It’s time to see what’s on the other side, right?” Adam asked, pointing to the mountain peaks.</p><br><p>The mountains were arranged in a crescent shape, closing off the abyss on one side. If they wanted to reach their destination, they had to climb the mountains.</p><br><p>“Pfffft! No matter what trick you just did, I’m still not satisfied that you didn’t show your full power!”</p><br><p>“Hah, we’ll have plenty of opportunities for that.”</p><br><p>With her cheeks puffed out, Alexia headed forward. Adam followed her, but before leaving the forest, he turned his head over his shoulder.</p><br><p>‘Hmm, is it just me, or is someone watching us? Is it some kind of monster? But… Why can’t I figure out where exactly they’re looking at us from?’</p><br><p>Adam had a strange feeling. He was sure that someone had been watching them all this time, maybe out of curiosity like other monsters, or maybe to wait for the right moment to attack them. He didn’t know.</p><br><p>It seemed to him that a hidden aura was coming from underground.</p><br><p>‘But that can’t be the case, can it?’</p><br><br><p>In the end, Adam shook his head as they headed straight for the mountains.</p><br><p>They were the K4-Phantoms, but such a long journey and the great mountains were no easy task even for them.</p><br><p>It took them more than half an hour to approach the top of the mountains, which greatly annoyed Alexia as she considered it boring work.</p><br><p>They continued to climb from one ledge to another until the snow-capped peak finally appeared far above.</p><br><p>“Tsk! Why did that stupid anomaly have to teleport us to this side? And now this wyvern!”</p><br><p>While Alexia complained, Adam looked around at the giant spine that covered them. It ran along the entire mountain range, and the ribs embedded in the stone had long since become part of the landscape.</p><br><p>‘Damn, how big was this monster? Someone that great, only someone like that could have destroyed the White Spire on the island. Still…’</p><br><p>Adam gulped as he realized that despite the monster’s power, it had been dead for a long time. Someone had fought it and killed it. That was really scary.</p><br><br><p>They grabbed the ledge and, with the next push, climbed to the very top.</p><br><p>A cold gust of wind greeted them as they got a full view of the Frost Ridge. It was a perfect match for what they had seen at the Winding Fragments.</p><br><p>“Hah…” Alexia chuckled. “This is really the place, right?”</p><br><p>Their eyes turned directly to the abyss. They knew this was their goal, as that was where their energy was leading them.</p><br><p>However, something made Adam frown.</p><br><p>“Hey, Alexia, something’s wrong here.”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” She turned around. “What do you mean?”</p><br><p>In response, Adam pointed to the mountain peaks on the right and left.</p><br><p>“Look, they’re empty. Why is it so quiet in such a large area? Even here, I can feel a high density of energy. I’m sure that when we get closer to the abyss, the effect will intensify.”</p><br><p>“Yeah, maybe this place is just too far away?” Alexia suggested.</p><br><p>Then, she waved her hand carelessly.</p><br><p>“Come on, all the monsters here are probably just hiding. They saw how strong I am and—!”</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, the ground shook as a huge shadow rushed past Alexia.</p><br><p>With her eyes wide open in panic, she watched as a giant ice worm swallowed Adam into its jaws with hundreds of teeth moving in a circle.</p><br><p>All Alexia could do was watch as the ice worm moved upward, blocking the sunlight with its great body and casting its shadow over her.</p>
