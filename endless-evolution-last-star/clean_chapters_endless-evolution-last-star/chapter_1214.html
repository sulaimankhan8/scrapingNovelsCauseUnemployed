            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1214: Two Princes</strong></p><br><p>Moroya’s appearance was not entirely unexpected. Adam and Fromund were aware that the Kirani Colony had a queen.</p><br><p>However, Moroya was preparing for battle, not only by increasing her strength but also by awakening the two princes, who were the strongest representatives of the Kirani Bugs after Moroya.</p><br><p>Neither the Kirani Keepers nor the Kirani Knights could match the princes, as they were supposed to be the next step in the colony’s expansion, allowing Moroya to spread her influence over several territories and gradually become stronger.</p><br><p>Like every Black Threat Level monster, Moroya had one extremely important task: to survive the World Wipe. This could only be done by finding a Lord to protect them or by becoming a Lord themselves.</p><br><p>Obviously, Moroya was going for the second option. Seven years wasn’t a very long time for a monster, and Moroya didn’t have much time, but if she could become a High Elder in the next two years, she had every chance of reaching the Baron Level six months to a year before the next World Wipe.</p><br><p>All monsters in Moroya’s position wanted to become Lords before the World Wipe, because it gave them not only power, but also independence.</p><br><p>If Moroya couldn’t become a Baron, she would have to ask a Lord for help. Such services were never free.</p><br><p>She wanted to avoid such a situation if possible. No one wanted to be under the control of someone else, especially if it was a stranger, a more dangerous and powerful person.</p><br><p>So, defeating Adam and Fromund was a good chance for Moroya to make up for the loss of two Twilight Crystals, no, even three, considering that she would have to give one to Bathild for her help.</p><br><br><p>The Silver Prince and the Amber Prince spread their wings, hovering above the ground.</p><br><p>They absorbed most of the energy of the amber pond, Moroya taking only a little as she wanted the princes to be as strong as possible.</p><br><p>“So, now it’s five against two.” Moroya slowly waved her hand, her eyes fixed on Adam and Fromund. “How about you surrender and save us all some time?”</p><br><p>Glancing back, she continued:</p><br><p>“This place is too far away for help to arrive in time. Unfortunately for you, you don’t stand a chance now.”</p><br><p>Without saying a word, Adam’s frame shook as he suddenly found himself in front of the heavily wounded Bathild.</p><br><br><p>Before she could react, his fist slammed into her face as his needle pierced her stomach. The wide blade came out the other side as Bathild gasped in shock.</p><br><p>Blood gushed out, flooding the ground as Adam raised his needle while Bathild’s body remained impaled on the blade.</p><br><p>With a cold stare, he tossed her aside, and she flew off the blade, crashing into the ground like useless trash.</p><br><br><p>She had expected any reaction, but not this. Fromund, the two princes, and even Marhen were in the same situation.</p><br><p>They didn’t know that Bathild was so badly wounded. She couldn’t do anything to defend herself against Adam and was now one step away from death. She had less than a minute left before the bleeding and internal wounds would kill her.</p><br><p>The reaction of the other monsters was close to shock. They couldn’t believe that Bathild, their leader, was going to die right now.</p><br><p>However, the only one who didn’t believe she was going to die, oddly enough, was Adam.</p><br><br><p>Ignoring Moroya, not wanting to give her presentation any importance, he headed towards the half-dead Bathild.</p><br><p>Marhen was in no hurry to help Bathild. He knew that Fromund would not allow it, and if Adam joined him, he might die even sooner. Or… was there another reason?</p><br><br><p>Adam’s question hung in the air.</p><br><p>“It’s time to admit that you can’t defeat me without using all your resources. Come on, show me what you’ve got, or you’ll die right here and now!”</p><br><br><p>With a loud crack, Adam’s foot slammed into Bathild’s stomach, surely breaking several of her ribs.</p><br><br><p>Blood gushed from her mouth, bringing her closer to her final breath.</p><br><p>Despite the critical situation, Moroya did not order the princes to attack. She knew Bathild had one more card to play, her last one. Everyone knew it.</p><br><p>“Shit…” Bathild cursed, struggling to get up from the ground.</p><br><p>Everything before her eyes was blurry, and darkness was approaching, wanting to plunge her into a peaceful, quiet sleep forever.</p><br><p>“You’re right… You’re fucking right!” Bathild bit her lip until it bled. “I can’t defeat you on my own… You… You’re the only monster among us all! FUCK! YOU, ADAM VINTER!”</p><br><p>With each shout, clots of blood flew out as her eyes filled with blood, ready to burst from the strain.</p><br><p>Her anger was obvious to everyone. She wanted to win, she wanted to be worthy, one of the strongest monsters, but she couldn’t.</p><br><p>Still, Bathild knew that neither Adam nor Fromund would leave here alive, even if it meant she had to go through a humiliating ritual.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Bathild’s aura grew stronger as the tattoo on her chest began to fill with energy.</p><br><p>Adam was in no hurry to finish off Bathild. Moreover, he knew that she could do it at any moment.</p><br><p>Fromund watched with curiosity as Marhen’s gaze grew stronger.</p><br><p>Perhaps others would disagree with Marhen’s opinion, but now he was convinced that Bathild could kill everyone here, whether it was Adam or Moroya.</p><br><br><p>Because the power she was about to obtain did not belong to her. It was not her hidden form or a risky ability. It was the reason why Bathild was so desperate to prove that she was special among the other Black Threat Monsters, among the other Elders.</p><br><p>But… in her attempts to surpass herself, to defeat Adam Vinter, the Phantom who surpassed her abilities, she had to use what she didn’t want to use the most.</p><br><p>At that moment, from the Dark Shore, a blue mass of energy rushed at tremendous speed, like a comet moving straight toward the Corrupted Volcano.</p>
