            <h4>Chapter 1065: Dark Frontier (Part 2)</h4><br><p>A cold wind blew across Rosana’s face while she watched the Soaring Chain Islands in the distance. She knew as well as anyone that soon, at the Soaring Chain Islands, there would be nothing but carnage.
</p><br><p>There could be no other way, for the Befallen Crown finally had a reason to get rid of Saegar. He was a powerful Lord and owned a lot of land.
</p><br><p>The Befallen Crown could not attack a monster like him without a good reason.
</p><br><p>Harboring a stellar Phantom like Adam in his territory was more than enough to get permission from the authorities.
</p><br><br><p>Osmer stepped forward, standing next to Rosana.
</p><br><p>"Elder Osmer... What will happen next? How many Lords have gone to destroy Saegar?"
</p><br><p>"Three. They set out immediately after our conversation with Ivar."
</p><br><p>Rosana blinked several times, baffled.
</p><br><p>"But, why? Wouldn’t one or at least two Lords be enough against Saegar? It is unlikely that Kenward would fight alongside him. Monsters from the Free End... They rarely ever bond with others."
</p><br><br><p>Osmer’s hand fell on Rosana’s shoulder.
</p><br><p>"Agh... Rosana, you haven’t even attained Elder status yet. For that reason, you don’t know that not all Lords are equally strong."
</p><br><p>Rosana puffed up her cheeks, slightly annoyed.
</p><br><p>She knew that once she evolved once more, she would be able to be called an Elder just like Osmer. In fact, first, she would be a Lesser Elder, then she would become just an Elder, and then a High Elder like Valdris was.
</p><br><p>It was the Elders as status monsters that were the main opponents for the K4-Level Phantoms.
</p><br><p>"This... I’m going to evolve soon. This will definitely happen! If it wasn’t for that insolent Phantom! Then I would have already approached the boundary by now! But..." she lowered her gaze. "It’ll take me quite a while to regain my strength."
</p><br><p>"I understand." Osmer nodded deeply, his eyes narrowed.
</p><br><p>After a few moments, Rosana turned to him. "Elder Osmer, I thought the Lords were the highest status. Isn’t that so?"
</p><br><p>Osmer nodded deeply. He, like all the monsters of the Dark Shore, wanted to reach this level, but he still had a long way to go, even for an old monster like him.
</p><br><p>"Well, Lords are very powerful. It’s a status you should strive for, Rosana, always. However, as with the Second Rank Phantoms, as they call themselves, there is no equality among the Lords."
</p><br><p>Rosana gulped. "The Second Rank Phantoms?"
</p><br><p>As soon as Osmer mentioned the title, her face darkened. She’d never encountered one, but she’d heard they were all terrifyingly powerful.
</p><br><p>"Yes, as you know, humans that have made it to the pinnacle of evolution are considerably less numerous than Lords. Unfortunately... Your Elder does not know all the reasons and details of this, but it is a fact. They are facing Lords on the battlefield, and it matters a great deal what kind of Lord they are, what their status is."
</p><br><p>Rosana nodded silently as she continued to listen.
</p><br><p>"The three Lords that traveled to the Soaring Chain Islands to crush Saegar are the Earls. If you were to become a Lord now, the Befallen Crown would give you the status of Baron. Baron, Viscount, and Earl are the three statuses for the so-called Lesser Lords."
</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Rosana’s body as she realized how much effort she needed to put in to keep up with such monsters.
</p><br><p>She dreamed of the day when she would become a Lord, that she would be one of the few strongest monsters, but... could monsters addressed as Lesser Lord be the strongest?
</p><br><br><p>"What..." she stammered. "What about Kenward and Saegar? If the Befallen Crown sent three Earls to battle against Saegar, then his status is much higher, right?"
</p><br><p>Osmer nodded deeply, keeping a calm face, but he didn’t want to admit it. He was too weak to confront Saegar, but as a member of the Befallen Crown, he wanted Saegar to disappear since he wasn’t going to take their side.
</p><br><p>"Saegar and Kenward... Monsters like them, ancient and mighty... Becoming Lords even before the others of the Hollow Wave monsters came along, carrying the proud status of being the True Lords, or... just the Lords."
</p><br><p>A cold torrent of wind swept in front of them, rippling the waters in the bloody river as Osmer muttered:
</p><br><p>"Unfortunately. There are humans in this world, the Phantoms are capable of standing up to even the True Lords. In the opposite case, everything would be resolved long ago... Perhaps we would be living in a peaceful world by now."
</p><br><br><br><p>A man in an elaborate suit, as if he were going to a party at the top of the skyscraper, walked slowly through the dark, earth reeking only of death and loneliness.
</p><br><p>Gladius threw off his jacket, leaving only his loose shirt, shivering in the brutal wind rushing over the sharp peaks of the mountains in the distance.
</p><br><p>"Hey, guys. I need to get to the Dark Shore right away. I hope you won’t get in my way, right?"
</p><br><p>He glanced up, looking at the two monsters hovering above the ground. Their red, wide wings moved slowly, under their menacing gazes.
</p><br><p>"Phantom, we didn’t attack and kill you just because that’s the order of the authorities," the woman growled, looking at Gladius with disdain.
</p><br><p>The man nodded deeply, his arms crossed over his chest. "You’re lucky that our strength, the strength of the Lords, can negatively affect the stability of the barrier, otherwise... There would be nothing left of you by now!"
</p><br><p>They expected to see fear in Gladius, but he only showed them a slight smile.
</p><br><p>The guards could not sense his aura as Gladius hid it. He didn’t want to draw too much attention to himself as it might prevent him from getting there on time.
</p><br><br><p>"Hahahahahahahaha!!!!"
</p><br><p>Gladius’s laughter erupted across the empty ground, stumping the guards.
</p><br><p>"What...? What’s so funny!!! Do you want to die?!" the woman exclaimed as flames ran along the edges of her wings.
</p><br><p>Gladius shook his head, holding his knees with bright laughter.
</p><br><p>"Sorry... It’s just..."
</p><br><p>He raised his head, revealing a smirk that gave the guards goosebumps and a captivating chill.
</p><br><p>"Funny how two Barons call themselves great Lords. After all... You’re just bugs in front of me, aren’t you?"</p>
