            <br><br><p>Kogen looked at his huge bag of cheese chips, flipping and shaking it, only crumbs fell, the only thing left of a snack portion meant for four people.
</p><br><br><p>Shrugging with a nonchalant face, Kogen crumpled the bag and tossed it back.
</p><br><p>He waved his hand, showing a gesture.
</p><br><p>A few seconds later, a girl approached him with a new snack, it was just as big a bag as the last one, but it wasn’t cheese chips but spicy, red like the flames that would soon be burning in his mouth.
</p><br><p>Then, the girl bowed low and stepped back into the shadows, disappearing behind the columns. She was one of the many servants of the Noukx Family, she was a common human but that didn’t stop her from helping Kogen Noukx personally.
</p><br><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.
</p><br><p>Again, the familiar crunch spread across the box, this time drawing Tilda’s attention. Earlier, Kogen had turned her down even though she hadn’t asked him to share, but now for some reason, she wanted to try those red chips.
</p><br><p>She had seen many times in commercials how people breathed fire as they stuffed a whole bunch of spicy chips into their mouths.
</p><br><p>Saliva slowly dripped from her mouth, she didn’t even notice it.
</p><br><p>Kogen raised an eyebrow, realizing that Tilda was looking at his chips.
</p><br><p>"Hey, didn’t I already tell you I wasn’t going to share? These chips are mine alone."
</p><br><p>Receiving a firm rejection, Tilda only gulped. Even though she wanted it and she was young, she realized that it was impossible to argue and be rude to someone like Kogen.
</p><br><p>The difference between their statuses was hard to even imagine.
</p><br><p>But... Kogen wasn’t the only influential person here. Someone could put pressure on him as well, albeit a minor one.
</p><br><p>Erik turned in Kogen’s direction, his hands remained on his cane.
</p><br><p>"Come on, you’re one of the most powerful men in the First Ring, but you’re not willing to share some simple chips with a little girl?"
</p><br><br><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.
</p><br><p>The crunch of chips filled the box again. Kogen’s hand dipped into the bag time after time, returning fully to end up in his mouth.
</p><br><p>Erik shook his head, fingertips on his forehead.
</p><br><p>"I swear, sometimes you act like a child. Fromund’s little sisters act more dignified than you. Damn, you’re also a high nobleman, manners, and etiquette have clearly never heard of you."
</p><br><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.
</p><br><p>The loud crunch of chips was all Erik heard in response to his complaint.
</p><br><p>Tilda blinked a few times looking at Kogen, her eyes went wide when she got an idea.
</p><br><p>"Wait... I don’t want your chips. If that girl brings me the same pack, it won’t be your chips anymore, it’ll be mine, won’t it?"
</p><br><p>’Oh, what a bold assumption. But... will it work?’ Erik thought for a moment.
</p><br><br><p>Kogen waved his hand, just like he did last time.
</p><br><p>Soon the same girl appeared from behind his throne, another bag of chips in her hands. She was about to hand it to Kogen, but he silently pointed at Tilda in the distance.
</p><br><br><p>The girl blinked in surprise a few times before nodding deeply and walking over to Tilda.
</p><br><p>"Please enjoy, but be careful, these chips are very spicy."
</p><br><br><p>With a deft movement, the girl opened the packet, the red-hot spice surging upwards like the pollen of a dangerous plant.
</p><br><p>"If you need anything, feel free to ask."
</p><br><p>With those words, she walked away, keeping her hands folded at her waist.
</p><br><p>Continue reading on NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>Tilda’s excited look brought a slight smile to Erik’s face.
</p><br><p>"That girl has a point. Unlike salty or sweet, spiciness is not a standard flavor. It’s a pain, with the constant presence of those wanting increasingly spicier food."
</p><br><p>Tilda nodded silently, pulling out the first chip and slowly nibbling on it. Soon her face flushed red with heat and her eyes went wide, the spiciness came faster than she expected filling her mouth like hellfire.
</p><br><p>Elva and Liv watched Tilda’s reaction closely, they wanted to try it too, it was evident in their expressions.
</p><br><p>"I’m not sharing! Ask for your chips!"
</p><br><p>No one expected this from her, she just lifted her chin and continued eating the chips, copying Kogen’s actions.
</p><br><p>Kogen who was trying not to be distracted from watching the fight by anything else, chuckled evilly.
</p><br><p>’Hehehe, she’s savvy, just like her big brother...’
</p><br><p>His turquoise eyes shifted to the arena.
</p><br><p>’It’s a shame that one of your brother’s trump cards was useless. Well, that doesn’t mean Adam should celebrate victory already. It certainly wasn’t his only trump card, I can see it in his gaze.’
</p><br><br><p>A cascade of sparks flew aside as the needle collided with the heavy black blade of a massive sword.
</p><br><p>For every attack, for every swing Fromund had to use the full force of his muscles, cutting through the air currents.
</p><br><p>The fight had been going on for some time now, so his fatigue was becoming greater and more distinct, especially after using his Second Order.
</p><br><p>And, Adam was in the same situation.
</p><br><p>They had used their abilities about equal times, but this was the third needle in Adam’s hands. He only used his First Order twice, but that was because of the feature of his special attack.
</p><br><p>’Not good... I feel a heaviness in my whole body. I don’t know how, but Fromund seems more energetic than me, even though most of the time I dodge and he attacks.’
</p><br><br><p>Fromund’s hands clenched tightly around the hilt of his sword as he abruptly turned his torso to the left. His whole body followed the movement, his feet kicked up dust upwards, a dangerous glint traveled down his blade aiming straight for Adam.
</p><br><p>Adam’s pupils narrowed as he put the needle in front of him in an attempt to defend himself, the dark sword was too fast.
</p><br><br><p>Half of his needle flew off to the side as a powerful blast of air threw Adam aside.
</p><br><br><p>Though Adam wasn’t hurt, but she realized that if he decided to summon a fourth needle it would be a serious stress to his body, perhaps even more than a meteorite to Fromund.
</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."
</p><br><p>Fromund was breathing heavily, looking at the shocked Adam.
</p><br><p>"Hah, what are you going to do now? I can destroy your needles as many times as it takes!"
</p><br><p>Throwing a glance at the massive sword, Adam’s eyes grew deeper.
</p><br><p>Then, he raised his hands, thrusting his palms forward, his fingers tensed like a puppeteer’s.
</p><br><p>Two snow-white rings appeared on his hands with two threads slowly swaying from side to side.
</p><br><p>"The needle is not my only weapon, Fromund."
</p><br><p>Adam’s voice echoed through the arena, reaching Fromund’s mind in a heartbeat.</p>
