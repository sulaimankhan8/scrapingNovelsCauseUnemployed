            <br><br><p>Adam and Spiro's NEPs flashed, and a notification appeared on the blue screens - the administration of the Twilight Palace recognized their fight and sent the nearest observer to approve their match as well as the stakes.</p><br><p>This was new to Adam, it was his first fight within the confines of the Twilight Palace, so he watched the silhouette approaching them with genuine curiosity.</p><br><p>It was a girl with shoulder-length brown hair cut evenly to one level. Her eyes were almost closed, and her hands remained behind her back.</p><br><p>Her clothes were austere and tight, vest, shirt, black pants, boots, and so on - pretty much the same thing Adam had seen on Andreas.</p><br><p>However, if Andreas looked like a real butler, the girl had a status a bit lower, like a high-ranking servant at the palace.</p><br><p>After a few steps, the girl stopped throwing her sly glance at the two young men ready to rush into battle at any moment.</p><br><p>Although the girl was not a Phantom or Operator, a dangerous aura emanated from her. Not as obvious as from Andreas or Douglas, but there was something wrong with her.</p><br><p>The girl glanced at Spiro without giving the nobleman much time and turned to Adam. Keeping her hands behind her back, she bowed low.</p><br><p>"Mr. Adam Vinter, it is a pleasure to welcome you at the Twilight Palace. It has not been long since your arrival, and you are already willing to rush into battle. That's very much like you."</p><br><p>More baffled than Adam was only Spiro. He didn't understand why the observer was ignoring him, yet paying so much attention to Adam.</p><br><p>'Maybe because he's new...?' Spiro internally muttered trying to make sense of the situation, 'No... I don't remember being treated like that. Perhaps she's just messing with him and this commoner doesn't understand anything?'</p><br><p>It seemed that Spiro was being overly arrogant because both nobles and commoners could be Phantoms, but his reaction was understandable. He knew how strong his bloodline was, how powerful the heads of families were, and he saw the achievements of other nobles at the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>Because of many factors, Spiro and a lot of the nobles thought they were better than the commoners, and... the higher the level, the more truth there was in that belief.</p><br><p>Then, the girl stood up and placed a palm to her chest, white gloves covering her hands.</p><br><p>"I am Observer No.6, my tasks include accepting stakes, approving fighters, observing the fight, and confirming the result with a reward to the winner."</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam stretched out, "Andreas said you have many ways to keep track of the coin count, but I didn't think it would be so official."</p><br><p>The girl smiled weakly, pointing slowly toward the Twilight Palace.</p><br><p>"After all, this isn't one big arena like the Moon Colosseum you fought in. We are obligated to do this to keep order."</p><br><p>As soon as her words sounded, Spiro's eyes went wide in disbelief. He was as aware of the Moon Colosseum as any nobleman, but he couldn't realize that Adam had fought there.</p><br><p>Sure, many nobles were watching Adam's fight, but not all of them. Especially the younger generation from the first four great families. There was a good chance that many of them didn't know about Adam and even less about his accomplishments.</p><br><p>The girl stepped forward as she continued her speech.</p><br><p>"Spiro is familiar with the rules, but you Mr. Adam should listen to me carefully."</p><br><p>Spiro flinched with indignation, he wanted to interrupt her but didn't have time:</p><br><p>"This is a fight to win, there are no rules or restrictions, you can use your abilities and apply the most brutal, bloody moves you know. The only thing you cannot do is drag others into your fight."</p><br><p>With a slight pause, she continued:</p><br><p>"If you are prepared to accept defeat, you must say it to me - to the observer. If you cannot speak, then clap your palm on the ground three times. If for some reason you cannot use your hands, then look at me and blink rapidly five times."</p><br><p>The girl narrowed her eyes, staring intently at Adam.</p><br><p>"Is that clear to you? This is important."</p><br><p>In response, Adam only waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Sure, let's get started already."</p><br><p>"As you wish," she nodded before turning to Spiro, "As with all fights the betting is standard - one twilight coin. Spiro Lorenzo only has two coins, Adam Vinter has three coins."</p><br><p>Without wasting a second, the girl reached for the bracelet on her wrist. In some ways it was similar to the NEP, but with a larger screen almost like a phone. The observer was preparing for the start of the fight by filling out information for the administration.</p><br><p>This gave the two fighters a free moment.</p><br><br><p>Adam asked in boredom, his eyes wandering sideways. He seemed uninterested in the fight.</p><br><p>"That means you lost at least once, doesn't it?" Adam stared at Spiro.</p><br><p>Irritation came over Spiro in an active stream, anger brewing inside.</p><br><br><p>In a broad sweep of his arm, Spiro exclaimed not wanting to appear weak in front of Adam.</p><br><p>"How I got or lost my coins shouldn't be your concern, for it won't be long before I have one more."</p><br><p>"Yeah... I won't argue with that."</p><br><p>Adam's reply stumped Spiro, but he didn't have time to realize what was going on here as the girl's voice rang out:</p><br><p>"Everything is ready," she took a few steps back, retreating to the wall, "You may begin at any time, don't be afraid to destroy the hotel grounds, everything will be rebuilt immediately after your battle."</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the two bracelets on Spiro's arms trembled as his eyes shone brightly, his Nexus was with him the whole time.</p><br><p>Streams of water covered his hands as his frame shuddered, throwing its owner into the fray. Spiro acted smartly, he wanted to attack first and thus gain an advantage.</p><br><p>In a few swift leaps, Spiro appeared in front of Adam as his palm, like a blade swept towards Adam's neck.</p><br><p>At the same time, with his hand in his pocket, Adam directed his gaze toward the girl as his lips slowly came into motion.</p><br>
