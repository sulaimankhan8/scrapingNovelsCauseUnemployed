            <br><p>Nessa's crimson hair fluttered in the wind, the swift currents of air trying to stop her falling at least a little, but her goal of reaching the ground was unwavering.</p><br><p>On her wrist was a white NEP like all Citadel Phantoms, and in her left ear was an earring in the shape of some monster's fang - her Nexus.</p><br><p>Sure, it was all just a fake just like her Phantom profile that Katrin's and Osana's Operators were now looking at.</p><br><p>'Hmm? I've never seen her before, who's that?' Alan, Katrin's Operator, muttered, 'Katrin, her profile is kind of odd, as is the fighter she flew in, but from the looks of it she's pretty strong. She's defeated many monsters from the Top-10 of the Purple Threat Level.'</p><br><p>"Agh?" Katrin frowned heavily, looking at the girl who somehow managed to fly to their rescue.</p><br><p>'Wait... This isn't a K2 or K3-Phantom, it's a K1-Phantom.' Alan quickly said with a confused look in his eyes.</p><br><p>He was one of the first to notice the fighter approaching, he breathed a sigh of relief as he figured Citadel had found a way to help Adam and the others. But... it was just a strong K1-Phantom, not someone who could actually make a difference with its overwhelming power.</p><br><p>"What?! Then how was she able to get here if Citadel hasn't sent a Phantom with suitable abilities yet!?" Katrin exclaimed in anger.</p><br><p>She didn't understand why it had already been so long but Citadel hadn't sent them help yet. Sure, Alan had already explained to her several times that Plague Reaper and his black air were to blame, but that didn't stop her from continuing to be angry and swearing at the management.</p><br><p>Osana narrowed her eyes, staring intently at Nessa, who had already opened her parachute, and quickly approaching the ground.</p><br><p>Osana either knew well or had at least heard of every capable K1-Phantom, someone like Adam and Alexia she had quite a bit of information on. Even if it was some secretive loner Phantom, its profile was always open and Osana had access to that data.</p><br><p>'Hmm... From the look on her face, she's pretty strong, and her Nexus is kinda weird... Well, there are a lot of interesting personalities among the Phantoms, it's weird that this is the first time I've seen her face and heard her name. Nessa Zephyr... Wait... that last name is pretty damn familiar.'</p><br><p>"ROOOOAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRR!!!"</p><br><p>Perhaps Osana might figure out that Nessa was a fake Phantom if she continued to ponder further, but the roar of a random monster brought her back to the battlefield.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>The monster quickly ran towards Nessa, intending to attack her as soon as she reached the ground. This monster was followed by two others, they felt a strange threat coming from Nessa that they couldn't explain.</p><br><p>Nessa cast a calm look at them, not afraid at all.</p><br><p>As she approached the battlefield, Magnus did his best to set her mind to a flawless victory against Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>The way he chose his words, tone, and accents was truly hypnotizing and motivating, and... Nessa didn't mind that at all. She wanted to outdo Adam, and she could do that if she beat Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>And, if she came out of this battle as the winner, she could get a piece of the Midnight Crystal. She had never absorbed energy before, but she felt that if she got into her fighting form, she could definitely do it.</p><br><p>Enjoy new chapters from empire</p><br><p>'Well... My father said that what happened to me in the lab is very similar to how the Phantoms' Resonance works...' Nessa muttered internally looking at the monsters below, they were already waiting to attack her.</p><br><p>'The effect is different, but the mechanism is the same. My genes like the Phantoms are starting to squeeze all the power out of me so that I win, so that I survive. The only downside is that like the Phantoms I can't control it.' Nessa pondered, glancing down at her hands.</p><br><p>She wanted to feel what it was like to fight with her long claws, seeing and hearing everything several times better even though her senses were much sharper than those of mere humans and Phantoms of her rank.</p><br><p>Then, Nessa sighed heavily, swinging her hand and cutting the parachute cables.</p><br><br><p>The massive monster opened its jaw wide, letting out a furious roar. Its horns shuddered before shimmering and releasing several lightning projectiles at Nessa.</p><br><p>Nessa's pupils narrowed as she arched her body sharply, letting the first projectile pass over her before deftly falling to the ground, touching the surface with her fingertips.</p><br><p>The second and third projectiles, two lightning spheres were already right in front of her, the distance was less than an arm's length away, but that wasn't a problem for Nessa.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, her silhouette blurred, turning into a shadow due to her high speed. Lightning spheres flew forward to collide with the ground and cause two deafening explosions.</p><br><p>Along with the wind streams coming from the shockwave, Nessa appeared in front of the main monster.</p><br><p>Osana and Katrin watched her actions intently. They wanted to see what her abilities were, what her Nexus was capable of, to use that information to prepare a plan.</p><br><p>But... even though Nessa was about to attack, she hadn't used a single ability yet, her eyes didn't flash, remaining calm and collected.</p><br><p>'Agh? What is she doing? If she wants to kill this monster, bare fists are not enough to do so. Damn, she seems to have a lot more self-confidence than experience.' Katrin frowned, shaking her head with regret.</p><br><br><p>Nessa's arms stretched forward, gripping the monster's horns tightly. A second later, the monster's face contorted in hellish pain as Nessa's powerful hands simply ripped its horns from its body, along with the flesh, blood, and protruding nerves.</p><br><p>Katrin's eyes went wide, disbelieving the level of physical strength that Nessa had demonstrated.</p><br><p>'What the hell...? She just ripped them out with her hands, merely straining her muscles...'</p><br><p>"AAAAARRRRRRRRRHHHTTT!!!"</p><br><p>The monster roared painfully, unable to ignore the painful shock that went through its body.</p><br><p>"Shut up, you're just wasting my time." Nessa growled menacingly before turning her wrists and thrust the monster's horns into its eyes, piercing its brain and head.</p><br><p>A stream of wind blew next to Osana, whose narrowed eyes watched Nessa intently.</p><br><p>"Oh... How curious..."</p>
