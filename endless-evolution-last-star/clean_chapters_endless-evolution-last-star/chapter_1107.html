            <h4>Chapter 1107: There’s nothing more for you to do here (Part 2)</h4><br><p>The last time Adam decided to go down to the Lower Ring, Erik helped him. They did it through government officials, but those departments were responsible for the Lower Ring and the Upper Ring.
</p><br><p>Adam no longer needed such secrecy. He had achieved his goal, although he had hoped to learn much more about Aiden Henk and was planning to leave the Lower Ring. Wilfred helped him with this, not personally, but through his people who had the most influence in these lands.
</p><br><p>Wilfred watched from above as his man led Adam and Silvana toward the northern passage, where an underground tunnel led to one of the elevators that only people with access could use.
</p><br><p>"Adam... Among young Phantoms, especially those as talented as you, there is often a position where you don’t want to choose sides. Well, sooner or later you’ll have to make a choice, hah, unless you die before the next World Wipe, of course."
</p><br><p>Then, Wilfred shook the ashes off, shaking his head.
</p><br><p>"The First Star and the Last Star will continue to collide with each other, destroying our world every time. I don’t know how long this will continue, but sooner or later it will come to an end."
</p><br><p>Darkness filled Wilfred’s eyes at the grim future that awaited them.
</p><br><p>"Either only monsters will remain, or only humans, or... our world will finally succumb to this torture that has been going on for many thousands of years. Although there is another option. The First Star or the Last Star... one of them will prevail in their eternal battle. Then, nothing else will matter."
</p><br><p>Wilfred did not mention a positive outcome because it was obvious that there was only one.
</p><br><p>Something or someone had to stop the battle between the First Star and the Last Star. Everything else was not so important.
</p><br><p>Monsters and humans could continue to be sworn enemies and wage bloody wars. It wasn’t as bad as the tens of billions of creatures dying every 250 years during the World Wipe.
</p><br><p>No matter how brutal the confrontations between humans and monsters could become, even over thousands of years, they could not reach the level of death that the First Star and the Last Star brought.
</p><br><p>"Alright." Wilfred brushed off the ashes. "I’m done with this kid, time to get back to work. Only 7 years left? Damn, how quickly time flies. I’ll need to stock up on cigarettes so I have enough to last until the Citadel is restored."
</p><br><br><br><p>Adam and Silvana followed the man in the black suit. If it weren’t for the Black Swan symbol on his NEP, they would think he was a secret government agent. Although his long blond hair would be against the rules.
</p><br><p>"Here." He said calmly, pointing to an inconspicuous building off to the side.
</p><br><p>They followed him when a shadow appeared from around the corner.
</p><br><p>Adam and the man managed to react and stepped aside as the figure collapsed to the ground after its failed jump.
</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion, glancing at the girl. "Risha? What are you doing here?"
</p><br><p>Immediately, Risha stood up, clenching her fists tightly in anger.
</p><br><p>"What?! You’re leaving the Lower Ring and didn’t even say goodbye to me?! Damn it! I was actually worried about you when I found out you were at the Dark Sh-!"
</p><br><p>Before Risha could finish, a man appeared behind her and covered her mouth.
</p><br><p>"Quiet. We’re still in the city. It wouldn’t be good if someone heard what they shouldn’t." The man stared at Adam. "Secrets must remain shrouded in darkness for those who are not ready for the truth. Am I right, Mr. Adam Vinter?"
</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly.
</p><br><p>"I’m afraid so. I didn’t understand it before, but it seems it was just childish foolishness. What’s more, there are many secrets you need to learn, even if you don’t want to."
</p><br><p>Risha’s eyes darted from side to side, from the man to Adam.
</p><br><p>She didn’t understand what they were talking about. She felt as if she were watching her brother talking to the other captains.
</p><br><p>It was important to remember that Risha was a K3-Phantom. She had become much stronger during her journey with Adam at the Fallen Ring Castle, but she still had to create her Third Key.
</p><br><p>She would have to find the Midnight Crystal or... the Twilight One?
</p><br><br><p>Adam put his hand on Risha’s shoulder and gave her a kind smile.
</p><br><p>"Thank you for supporting me. I will always remember the battle at the Fallen Ring Castle, the serpents, my enemies, and especially my allies. Hah, it was dangerous at the Dark Shore, but as you can see, I’m fine."
</p><br><p>Risha gulped, looking at Adam. She could feel how much stronger his aura was. She knew that he had become a K4-Phantom. Orel had told her everything. He was the one who had guided her here, knowing that Wilfred would send Adam to the Upper Ring.
</p><br><p>It wasn’t just that Adam didn’t belong to the Lower Ring. No, in this case, the fact that he became a K4-Phantom played the greatest role.
</p><br><p>"Shit..." Risha puffed out her cheeks. "Don’t think you’re better than me! Give me some time, and I’ll become a K4-Phantom as well!"
</p><br><br><p>Adam laughed as he turned to look at the top of the Black Tower.
</p><br><p>"Good. Then do it as quickly as possible! I’ll give you no more than five years, otherwise you’re a loser!"
</p><br><p>"Pffft! Five years?! I’ll do it in a year!"
</p><br><p>In response, Adam only nodded slightly. Even if it was Risha, he couldn’t talk about the World Wipe without permission, and he didn’t want to.
</p><br><p>Despite becoming stronger and being able to create the Third Key and open the Lock, he received nothing but bad news.
</p><br><br><p>Adam’s eyes deepened.
</p><br><p>’Now I know the truth, at least most of it. There are still secrets left, I’m sure of it.’
</p><br><br><p>"Mr. Adam, it’s time."
</p><br><br><p>"Sure, it’s time to go home."</p>
