            <br><p>The phantoms and monsters didn't know what exactly was going on in the depths of the fortress, but they knew that something was happening there, and they had plenty of clues, whether it was a strange aura, the earth rattling, or the crimson mist.</p><br><p>Yet, all of that was nothing compared to the changes that took less than five minutes.</p><br><p>Streams and massive pillars of blood covered the dark lands, around the fortress, outside the ice towers, and near the hills.</p><br><p>The serpent spire was great and terrible, but all that ceased to matter when the Crimson Monarch and the Unknown Phantom appeared.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch took the Operators job for himself, he told of the Phantom's name before they could pass that information on to their partners.</p><br><p>Adam Vinter, it was the Unknown Phantom. There could be no mistake.</p><br><p>It was a name that many of the Phantoms gathered in the fortress knew. Many of them had been K1-Level not long ago, so they heard that Adam had killed the Plague Reaper. Moreover, when Katrin proclaimed herself the leader, those who hadn't heard about that fight now knew since they were curious about what achievements their leader had.</p><br><p>Did anyone guess that Adam VInter was an Unknown Phantom? It was a possibility, but it was very unlikely to be true. No one thought of a specific person when imagining Unknown Phantom, it was a mystery - until now.</p><br><p>Gnash's eyes went wide as well as most of the Phantoms beside her, a wave of shock went through the entire fortress, leaving people with dazed expressions.</p><br><p>Those who had the opportunity immediately directed their gazes towards the north tower. A multitude of monsters had defended it to keep the fog and energy effect, now the great structure split in two.</p><br><p>The upper, thinner part of the tower was slowly slanting forward, aiming for the ground along with the misty star at the very peak.</p><br><p>Eager to capitalize on the chaos, several monsters rushed towards the northern ice tower.</p><br><p>They saw this as an opportunity - to finally destroy the tower to the end and the injured Phantom.</p><br><p>This would be the beginning of victory for them, as the flame monsters would finally be able to regain their power and no longer fear the cold energy.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>A large flame monster with paws as heavy as hammers moved quickly to the foot of the tower, looking at the falling shadow from its center.</p><br><p>The monsters with frost energy didn't know what to do, they could feel that the fog was slowly dissipating. Their reason to defend the tower disappeared, they needed to head towards another tower, and it made no sense for them to get between their fellow monster and the Phantom.</p><br><p>Yet, several Phantoms were near the northern tower. After the Blind Sinner created the ice towers, some Phantoms split into groups to help the frost monsters defend the source of the fog.</p><br><p>Although the Phantoms were helping the monsters, it was a favorable situation for them. Any actions that drove the monsters away from the walls increased their chances of surviving the eclipse.</p><br><p>The tall man with the stone hammer in his hand turned around abruptly.</p><br><p>He couldn't see Adam through the fog, but he as well as the flaming monster spotted his silhouette collapsed into layers of snow and ice.</p><br><p>"Damn it!" the man shouted looking at his comrades, "We have to help him! If it's Adam Vinter he could be our trump card!"</p><br><p>The girl standing to the side gulped uncertainly:</p><br><p>"But... Isn't Adam Vinter a K2W0-Phantom? I mean... Even if he's talented and always defeats strong monsters he's on the same level as most of us."</p><br><p>A sharp, calm voice interrupted her:</p><br><p>"It doesn't matter."</p><br><p>A man with a bow and long blonde hair stepped forward.</p><br><p>"Even if he was a K0-Level, he's still a Phantom, one of us. We should save him if we have the chance."</p><br><p>Pale green energy wandered beside the man, heading towards his bow in swift streams.</p><br><p>In the next second, an arrow of dense wind, a green ray, snapped off the bowstring.</p><br><p>The man aimed at the flame monster, but the large creature had time to react and bounced aside at the last moment.</p><br><p>However, the man was not disappointed, his shot had another purpose - to dispel the fog.</p><br><p>Brisk gusts of wind blew the fog around, revealing the front side of the tower, still Adam's silhouette was hidden, but he only needed to take one step to get out of the cover.</p><br><p>ROOOOOOOOOAAAAAARR!!!</p><br><p>With a furious roar, the fiery monster lashed out at Adam, its paws raised high up, wanting to turn the phantom into a bloody blur in a single attack.</p><br><p>The man with the hammer lunged forward, trying to catch the defense, but the distance was too great.</p><br><br><p>A tightly clenched fist came out of the mist, smashing straight into the monster's head. The sturdy black stone armor cracked, shattering into multiple shards.</p><br><p>The impact, followed by an air ring, swept through the monster in one powerful pulse, its body shuddering, narrowing, and expanding as if it were ready to explode from sheer force.</p><br><p>The shockwave threw the flame monster back dozens of meters. On its way, the flame monster crashed into several others, scattering them apart with its massive body.</p><br><br><p>A large shadow crashed into a clump of snow, black sand mixed with ice crystals surged upwards in a lone pillar.</p><br><p>A second later, thick dark blood became a part of it, pouring out from wide rips on the flaming monster's body.</p><br><p>It survived, but if its body weren't so sturdy, a little more fragile, then one direct punch would be enough to blast it into chunks of flesh.</p><br><p>The man with the hammer and his partners froze in shock. They wanted to save Adam, to help him, but he dealt with the monster faster than they could do anything.</p><br><p>The girl with the daggers in her hands gulped, soon her green eyes lowered looking at something strange - the snow near the tower was melting.</p><br><br><p>Slowly, Adam stepped forward, leaving the layer of fog. Red flames continued to burn on his legs and needle, overpowering the frosty power of the tower and defying it.</p><br><p>Then, finally seeing Adam, Phantom's eyes filled with disbelief, but for a different reason.</p><br><p>His veins were swollen to their limit and his eyes were bloodshot, his muscles trembling, tense to their peak.</p><br><p>Adam Vinter entered Resonance.</p>
