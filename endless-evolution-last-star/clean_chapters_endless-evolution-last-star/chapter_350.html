            <br><p>Adam, Katrin, and Osana, like all the monsters inside the ring of flames, watched intently the actual execution of the fire monster.</p><br><p>It was like torture from the Middle Ages, the jaws ripping off chunks of its flesh while the monster was still alive, until it bled too much and the wounds became critical.</p><br><p>Katrin occasionally paid attention to what was happening to the black vines. They were sturdy, numerous, and strong but not invulnerable.</p><br><p>'I see...' Katrin internally muttered watching as several black vines burned, being too close to the monster's flaming claws.</p><br><p>The monster didn't notice this, as it was already too close to death, even after ending its life, it didn't realize that it could have gotten out of this trap if it had made the right moves.</p><br><p>However, it gave Katrin some ideas, for she was the one who had a way to get rid of the ink streams, jaw-flowers, and black vines.</p><br><p>'What? Katrin, are you sure?' Silvana asked, in a slightly nervous voice.</p><br><p>'Even if you have a way to do it, I would advise you to wait, since you benefit from the monsters fighting each other.'</p><br><p>Katrin was about to reply, but she was overtaken by Osana, who stepped forward with a frown.</p><br><p>"No, Katrin is right, we should deal with this problem as soon as possible." Osana said looking forward.</p><br><p>With each passing second, the air grew blacker as with each breath of the jaw-flowers, the clean harmless air became less and the black deadly one became more.</p><br><p>The only one who benefited from this was Plague Reaper. He was the one immune to the black air, for he was the cause of its emergence and spread.</p><br><p>"If we wait any longer, we'll get all the monsters dead. Sure, on the one hand, it's beneficial for us because then we'll be in a 3 vs. 1. It will definitely help us defeat Plague Reaper." Osana said before turning her gaze to Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>She continued while clenching her fists tightly.</p><br><p>"However... In that case, we'll just let the black air fill everything around us and if my wind defense somehow goes down or it breaks through it, we'll be dead the next time we take another breath. It's too risky."</p><br><p>Osana pointed at the jaw-flower that the flame monster was about to attack earlier.</p><br><p>"Moreover, he will most likely eventually develop ink streams and freely summon black vines and jaw-flowers wherever he wants."</p><br><p>Osana sighed heavily, gritting her teeth as she realized what would happen in such a case.</p><br><p>"If we let him develop his ability further, we'll be in a situation where we'll have to fight not only him but dozens of black vines and jaws willing to devour us at any mistake. And... that's all assuming that as soon as my wind veil falls, we die because of the black air."</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, as her face flushed with shame. As an Operator, she had to offer always the best and most pragmatic options leading to an imminent victory on the battlefield.</p><br><p>It was logical because unlike the Phantoms, who were in the midst of battle, she was safe in the Citadel. She had time to think to come up with a decent plan, for she was calm and collected.</p><br><p>'Yes... Osana is right, I'm sorry for interrupting you.' Silvana said calmly, effortlessly accepting her mistake.</p><br><p>"That's alright, as we really weren't in the easiest situation. So... Katrin, are you ready? I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do to help you. All I have left is petals." Osana shrugged her shoulders with an apologetic face.</p><br><p>Katrin frowned heavily, looking at Osana with slight disdain. She realized that Osana had yet to use her Second Order which by the looks of it was something important and could make a significant change on the battlefield.</p><br><p>"Sure, don't worry. In a way, we're even lucky that I saved my strength for this moment."</p><br><br><p>Katrin struck the ground with her staff again causing the roots to emerge from the ground and turn into a massive flower with six yellow petals emitting their energy-rich pollen.</p><br><p>The flower grew right next to the Fume Cathedral, being on a slight elevation in relation to the arena, with Plague Reaper and Midnight Crystal at the center of it.</p><br><p>However, this was not Katrin's way of getting rid of the ink streams. This was preparation and help for Adam and Katrin since the pollen would help them for a long time afterward, quickly restoring their energy reserves.</p><br><p>Then, Katrin stepped forward confidently, leaving the Fume Cathedral, which was now split in two by the wide hole left by the fall of the Midnight Crystal.</p><br><p>The stones shook under her feet, sinking into a dense layer of dust covering the cold gray earth as she walked towards the aggressive wind currents.</p><br><p>The monsters took notice of her, many of them puzzled and surprised, as they didn't know there was anyone else in Fume Cathedral besides Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>Only then did they see that behind Katrin, stood Adam, exuding pure power, and Osana, who had willed herself to become Adam's shadow. Her face was calm and her gaze deep with unknown motives.</p><br><p>"Well... I usually summon one or two, five at most..." Katrin muttered, remembering past times when she used her Second Order, "But... this time I'll have to use every last drop of energy."</p><br><p>Katrin gulped, before setting aside her staff and pointing her hand forward. She looked at the numerous ink streams, she had to destroy every one of them.</p><br><p>Her eyes glowed brightly, making the ground beside her shake, and her fingertips flashed with a scarlet light unnatural to her.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A multitude of long roots, completely smooth, without any thorns, quickly spread from Fume Cathedral forward, covering a large area inside the flame ring.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper looked at these roots curiously, not understanding what Katrin was doing. Only after a few seconds did he notice that the roots had closed buds, like flowers ready to open and bloom with the arrival of spring.</p><br><p>"Fuck..." Katrin muttered as trickles of blood poured from her eyes, "This is a whole other level, right?"</p><br><p>Katrin slowly turned her wrist, opening her palm wide, facing upwards to the sky.</p><br><p>Simultaneously with her movement, waves of red energy traveled through the roots, causing all the buds to open, one by one.</p><br><p>Behind the dense buds lurked flowers with five thick petals and sparse black spots, showing that these flowers were only a threat, nothing more.</p><br><p>"Well... It's pretty weird that the support with that ability doesn't want to be the support a single day more, right?" Katrin smiled bitterly as she looked at the dozens of red flowers.</p><br><p>She shrugged with a heavy meaningful sigh.</p><br><p>"I'll never change, I'll never be satisfied, because I need more power. This ability has only come in useful at its full power now, for the first and last time."</p><br><p>Katrin muttered with a deep look before clenching her fist sharply.</p><br><p>Dozens of bright flashes covered the roots, these were red flowers whose petals were quickly saturated with dense energy.</p><br><p>Before the monsters or Plague Reaper could do anything, all the flowers exploded, shaking the ground, burning everything in their path like an uncontrollable force of nature.</p>
