            <br><p>The final 20th day had arrived.</p><br><p>Although Risha had a few ideas for her future ability, it wasn't enough to break the fourth lesser gates. Sure, she took a few confident steps forward, but by the end of their time she was unable to achieve what she wanted.</p><br><p>Now, Adam, Risha and dozens of serpents stood in the center cavern. In the center were Vorx and Heret, behind them were Grita and Torz.</p><br><p>Heret stepped forward, his hands behind his back and his gaze stern.</p><br><p>"Alright, a detachment of the Light Legion will be arriving at the scarlet cliff tomorrow. They have already started gathering resources from other places on the west side of the castle, so soon they will reach us, that's for sure. We'll attack them at that moment since we can't hide and wait any longer."</p><br><p>Then, Heret pointed to Vorx, who stood beside him as the second leader of the resistance.</p><br><p>"As you know, Arnoth made my friend Vorx search for a strong Phantom. It's been a long time now, but Vorx has yet to complete that task. We don't know exactly what Arnoth is thinking, but Kreyna has definitely started to suspect something. A few more days and she'll come after us, so we can't wait any longer."</p><br><p>After a few moments, Heret coughed and pointed at Adam. He gestured for him and Risha to step forward to face the dozens of staring serious-minded serpents.</p><br><p>Many serpents already knew they would be assisted by the Phantoms, but not all. Some were seeing Adam and Risha for the first time, genuine shock was on their faces.</p><br><p>"W-Wait!" one of them stepped forward. "Mr. Heret, are you sure we can trust the Phantoms?"</p><br><p>Heret nodded deeply. He did not reprimand this serpent, as he realized that someone had to ask such a question. This reaction was predictable.</p><br><p>"Sure, I won't call them our friends. We are not friends, but that is not a requirement to be allies. Adam and Risha are strong Phantoms, and they have accepted Vorx's offer. Furthermore, the External Artifact of the Magma Plateau has embraced Risha as its partner."</p><br><p>The puzzlement on the serpents' faces was replaced by curiosity.</p><br><p>The tall man stepped forward, holding his palm respectfully to his chest.</p><br><p>"If you say so, then we have no reason to disbelieve you, all I, my friends, and all of us, the Serpent Folk, want is to avenge the king and queen and reclaim our castle for ourselves!"</p><br><p>He exclaimed, slamming his fist on his chest in a fiery speech.</p><br><p>"To do that, we don't just need allies, we need strong warriors! These two Phantoms..." the man ran his gaze over Adam and Risha. "Are they strong enough to help us in the battle against the Light Legion?"</p><br><p>The serpents were trying to keep their voices down, but they were actively nodding their heads and whispering. The serpents were in a desperate situation. They were willing to go to any lengths to gain their freedom and regain their territories.</p><br><p>Everyone realized that sooner or later, they would no longer be needed by Arnoth and Kreyna, and then they would be not just slaves but dead men. Arnoth would move on and leave behind a mountain of corpses.</p><br><p>"I understand your concern." Heret's voice broke. "But you should have no doubts about their power. As you know, the original plan was for Vorx and me to fight against Arnoth and Grita, with Torz to take on Kreyna. Things are different now."</p><br><p>Heret pointed at Risha.</p><br><p>"This is Risha, she along with Vorx will take on Kreyna. We believe their strength will be enough to defeat her or at least break a draw before help arrives. Grita and Torz will lead the rebellion and take part in the main battles, quickly destroying the ranks of the Light Legion.</p><br><p>"As you can understand. In that case, it will be me and Adam against Arnoth. We feel that this is the best option and our powers will be enough to prevail."</p><br><p>There was more behind Heret's words than just a change in the participant list.</p><br><p>He showed the other serpents that Adam was stronger than Vorx and that Risha was superior to Grita and Torz.</p><br><p>It couldn't help but make the serpents smile. Some realized it at once, some were tipped off by a mate, yet the good news spread quickly through the ranks.</p><br><p>Then, Heret stepped forward to the table where the map was spread out.</p><br><p>"As you know our attack will begin with the killing of the Light Legion squad at the scarlet cliff. Then, our men will begin small clashes throughout the castle grounds. However, we will start from the edges, with one-ring towers moving into the two spires. In this way, we will gradually encircle the Light Legion and surround the castle."</p><br><p>The serpents nodded deeply, no one daring to interrupt Heret.</p><br><p>Adam and Risha looked up. This was the first time they heard the details of the plan, so they were attentive.</p><br><p>"Vorx and Risha will head east and first assist in the battles against the Light Legion, then they will enter the castle, heading for the hall on the first floor. There, Kreyna will be waiting for them. She gives orders from there and carries out executions there as well, so... it's the only place she can be."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion. "What about the throne room? Can't she escape there?"</p><br><p>Heret nodded. "Sure, she will, in the beginning, but not to hide but to inform Arnoth of the rebellion. Then, she will return to her position and take the charges at the main gate. One way or another, Arnoth won't let her stay in the throne room for long."</p><br><p>"W-Why?" Risha tilted her head, lost.</p><br><p>"Because he knows he's the last threat. The strongest resistance fighters will head straight for him, or else all this is pointless. However, Arnoth has no idea that it won't be Vorx and me fighting against him, but Adam and I."</p><br><p>For another half hour or so, Heret went on and on about the details of the plan, answering questions from the worried serpents.</p><br><p>At the very end, one of the serpents, the old warrior, stepped forward, staring intently at Heret.</p><br><p>"Heret..." he wheezed.</p><br><p>Unlike the others, he addressed him simply by name. He was old, but a flame burned brightly in his eyes.</p><br><p>"I guess someone had to ask that question. Even with all our preparations, the time we had and the two strong Phantoms Vorx brought.</p><br><p>"What are our chances?"</p><br><br><p>Silence reigned among the serpents, as gloom covered their faces. No one here was a child or a novice, each was an experienced fighter, a monster that had gone through several evolutions to reach the Red Threat Level.</p><br><p>No K2-Phantom or lower could stand up to the Serpent Folk, but now their enemies were not weak Phantoms, but terrifyingly powerful monsters that invaded their home.</p><br><p>Heret cleared his throat before stepping forward.</p><br><p>He glanced around the crowd, trying to give everyone at least a brief moment.</p><br><p>"I know I didn't answer that question before, but there's no point in hiding anything now. Before Adam and Risha joined us..."</p><br><p>He waved his hand in the direction of the Phantoms.</p><br><p>"Me, Vorx, Grita, and Torz thought we had a 25% to 35% chance of winning. Not great, but we would have done it anyway.</p><br><p>"Now, we have two strong allies against two dangerous enemies. Our capabilities have increased, as have our chances of victory. I don't want to give an exact number, no one knows it, but I'm convinced that our chances to win are now greater than to lose."</p><br><p>The old serpent smiled bitterly, glaring at Heret, who was trying to maintain a cold expression.</p><br><p>"But..." the old serpent wheezed. "We can still lose and die, every single one of us, right?"</p><br><br><p>"Absolutely. I want you to know that in that case, I will gladly die fighting alongside you against our common enemy. I will not regret my death, knowing that it was in an attempt to avenge the queen and king and reclaim our home."</p><br><p>Then, the old serpent bent low in respect.</p><br><p>One serpent after another followed the older one's example, giving Heret the treatment that only the king and queen could previously receive.</p><br><p>Even a steadfast warrior like Heret was embarrassed. Their reaction baffled him, yet he quickly regained his posture, not daring to disrespect them.</p><br><p>Adam and Risha looked at each other.</p><br><p>This was a new experience for both of them. In their time as Phantoms, they had never seen monsters interact like this.</p><br><p>They were like humans, too much so.</p><br><p>'How strange...' Adam muttered internally. 'Somehow, I can easily picture the Crimson Monarch standing instead of Heret. They're monsters, but they're not wild ones. Sure, they're enemies of humanity, and I think they've killed quite a few Phantoms, but... can't we make a deal with them?'</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam remembered Vorx's words, how Arnoth and Kreyna appeared - the black flash.</p><br><p>'I see. Not all monsters are the same. I need to find out how much they differ and why.'</p>
