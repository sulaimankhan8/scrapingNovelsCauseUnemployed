            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1283: Cut Seal</strong></p><br><p>Nollura clearly wasn’t ready for Adam to jump straight into battle.</p><br><p>In fact, even for Adam, this wasn’t something he usually did. He loved to fight, but he wasn’t some crazy beast who only saw bloodlust. If it was necessary, he could find the patience to wait.</p><br><p>However, not this time.</p><br><p>He couldn’t wait for a real, serious fight, which he hadn’t had in quite a while. Despite the many events that had occurred after the Fallen Ring Castle, the last strongest opponent Adam had fought was still Arnoth.</p><br><p>Sure, Bathild or the Red Bloom were strong, and they would have easily defeated Arnoth if it had come to that, but that would have been only because of the difference in their power levels, which was not what Adam wanted.</p><br><p>So, Adam’s impatience was based on the fact that he simply wanted to deal with Nollura quickly so that he would have a way to summon Ureyn to the String Duel.</p><br><p>For that, he needed Nollura’s head because of her long history with Ureyn?</p><br><p>Well, Adam was ready to get it quickly and easily. For an experienced Phantom like him, killing another monster was no problem.</p><br><p>Reaching the end of the cave, he demonstrated this.</p><br><p>It didn’t matter that Nollura was the strongest in this rift; compared to Adam or any mill owner, she was quite weak. That was how the hierarchy at the Forgotten Mills was structured, which is why she remained here in the nest instead of venturing out to claim her territory or take it from someone else.</p><br><p>Adam wanted Nollura’s head, and that was about to happen, but… he didn’t know about one trump card that Nollura had recently acquired.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The black barrier trembled, successfully blocking Adam’s needle, even though he put all his strength into this attack.</p><br><p>His energy could not achieve anything; the barrier seemed unshakable under any pressure.</p><br><p>And… Nollura was as surprised as he was. She didn’t expect to have to use this emblem, and even more so that it would actually save her life.</p><br><p>She knew that some Phantom would come to her soon, but she didn’t know who it would be.</p><br><p>Thus, she wasn’t expecting Adam specifically, but any Phantom, but his power exceeded all expectations, and the situation quickly became critical.</p><br><p>However… even after that, Adam had no intention of stopping.</p><br><p>He didn’t know the essence of this emblem and protective barrier, but all he needed to do was deliver the final blow to Nollura.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>His aura trembled as he replaced the first needle with the second one.</p><br><p>As soon as Nollura’s gaze fell on the small white needle in his hand, he made a swing, creating the lesser path.</p><br><p>It was not something that Nollura was capable of blocking. She did not have powerful defensive abilities, and now she was quite badly wounded due to Adam’s constant throws.</p><br><br><p>The black barrier was able to withstand even that.</p><br><p>The emblem clutched in Nollura’s hand and drenched in her blood trembled, using more power from the source to stop Adam, and it worked.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened in disbelief when a barely noticeable impulse passed through the barrier, delivering a powerful blow to him.</p><br><p>The impact threw Adam aside with such force that he didn’t have time to stop or even use his threads to grab onto something.</p><br><p>His back slammed into the wall with a crash, raising a cloud of dust.</p><br><p>Shards flew away, causing the black spiders hiding there to scatter like frightened cockroaches.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Nollura’s heart beat wildly as she looked at the emblem. There was nothing remarkable about it, just a simple black seal, completely flat except for a single diagonal line, like a cut in the ground made by a very sharp blade.</p><br><p>A few seconds later, footsteps sounded in the distance as Adam emerged from the cloud of dust with the same menacing look as before.</p><br><p>He brushed a trickle of blood from the corner of his mouth, leaving a trail on the dusty ground with each step.</p><br><p>Still, he did not rush to attack Nollura, although a minute ago he would have done so without hesitation.</p><br><p>He realized that something was wrong, not only with their fight, but with the strange emblem and Nollura’s reaction to it.</p><br><p>“What is that seal?” Adam asked, pointing to the emblem.</p><br><p>Now, Nollura finally had a chance to start a conversation and explain the situation. It was a little late, as she had already sustained several wounds, but it was much better than death.</p><br><p>“Shit! That’s what I wanted to show you in the beginning! Did you really have to attack me right away? I tried to start a conversation twice, but you didn’t listen!”</p><br><p>A sharp gleam flashed across Adam’s eyes.</p><br><p>“Because instead of talking about something I didn’t even know about, you started with a joke. You’d better think about what you say when someone comes to cut off your head. Including right now.”</p><br><p>Nollura bit her lip almost to the point of bleeding. To some extent, Adam was right. If she had shown him the emblem from the very beginning, she might not have had to fight him, although it was more like a beating.</p><br><p>“You came here from Gareyna, right? The bitch who owns a white mill.”</p><br><p>“Yeah, but… how do you know that? I’m sure no one was eavesdropping on our conversation. How could a weakling like you know that?”</p><br><p>Nollura’s eyebrow twitched at Adam’s words, but she was in no position to argue.</p><br><p>“About an hour before you reached the cave entrance, a Lord came to me and gave me this emblem. He said it would save my life and that Phantom would come here and need this emblem.”</p><br><p>The situation became more complicated, as neither Adam nor Silvana knew about these details. Perhaps even Gareyna had no idea that someone had learned of her plans.</p><br><p>“And what faction was this Lord from?”</p><br><p>Nollura clutched the emblem tighter.</p><br><p>“Black Cut… This Lord said that this emblem would help you arrange a fight, whatever that means.”</p>
