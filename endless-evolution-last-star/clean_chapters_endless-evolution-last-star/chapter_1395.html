            <h4>Chapter 1395: Pink Bartender</h4><br><br><p>The doors opened as Adam found himself in the middle of a tavern. Numerous tables full of food and patrons came into view, as did a large bar in the center.
</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam stopped, while strange feelings overwhelmed him.
</p><br><p>He had been to many bars, coffee shops, and restaurants in the Citadel, but the Raven Beak was both similar and different from all of those places.
</p><br><p>’Damn, it’s like an old bar from a book, but... it doesn’t look old at all.’
</p><br><p>Adam soon realized that it was because of the energy crystals, which not only served as a source of light but also helped in cooking, maintaining the right temperature, and lighting smoking pipes.
</p><br><p>All Adam knew about Helasa was that she was Norax’s friend and also owned this tavern.
</p><br><p>’Alright, if you’ve come to the tavern, there’s only one person who knows everything.’
</p><br><p>Adam headed straight for the bar.
</p><br><p>Several patrons glanced at Adam, but nothing remarkable happened on their part. Adam was very good at hiding his aura. It wasn’t because of training, but rather because he had been through many battles and had developed the ability to do it naturally.
</p><br><p>Sure, if he were to fight one of the patrons, all the monsters here would instantly realize that he was a Phantom, but right now, he was just another patron who had come to drink or eat.
</p><br><p>Behind the bar stood a girl with short pink hair and surprisingly large eyes. She wore the standard black and white uniform for her job.
</p><br><p>With an energetic look, she was mixing a cocktail when she noticed Adam.
</p><br><p>"Oh, welcome to the Raven Beak!" she exclaimed.
</p><br><p>Adam nodded weakly, glancing at the many bottles of alcohol behind the girl. They were of every shape and size he could imagine.
</p><br><p>’Hmm, they have both names and brands... Damn, if I didn’t know this bar was in the Tarnished Lands, I wouldn’t be able to tell that this alcohol is from Izardo and not the Citadel.’
</p><br><p>"Would you like anything?" the girl asked. "We have a variety of cocktails and the best alcohol from all over Izardo. Well, there’s also juice, water, milk, and coffee!"
</p><br><p>Adam looked up and smiled. He didn’t know why, but the girl in front of him radiated energy.
</p><br><p>"Hah, looks like you love your job, right?"
</p><br><p>"Of course!" The girl exclaimed and patted her chest. "My name is Reyla! Nice to meet you, what about you?"
</p><br><p>Out of habit, Adam was about to answer, but... he remembered in time that his name could cause problems. Maybe he was exaggerating his importance, or maybe it was the right decision.
</p><br><p>He just shook his head and pointed to the coffee pot.
</p><br><p>"One coffee, please, with milk and sugar."
</p><br><p>"Sure!" Reyla replied immediately, seemingly not even noticing that he had ignored her question. "Would you like honey or sugar?"
</p><br><p>Adam touched his chin thoughtfully.
</p><br><p>"Honey? Yeah, that would be nice."
</p><br><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow when Reyla opened a drawer containing more than ten types of honey of different colors, but to his relief, she chose the amber one, the kind that no one would refuse, neither monster nor human.
</p><br><p>’This city has a lot to offer, but if you’re a human, some things may not suit your tastes. Hah, come to think of it, I don’t even know what kind of meat was in that man’s bun. I hope I won’t regret it when I find out.’
</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam realized something: he still had no money, none at all.
</p><br><p>Obviously, the coffee wouldn’t cost much, but he didn’t have a single coin or credit. If Reyla realized that he wasn’t going to pay, it might attract attention that he wanted to avoid.
</p><br><br><p>A few minutes later, Adam was presented with a large cup of coffee that resembled a sweet cocktail more than a strong, invigorating drink. However, she had fulfilled his order perfectly.
</p><br><p>"Reyla, I have a question for you..." Adam began, carefully taking the hot cup in his hands.
</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Reyla tilted her head. "Sure! Ask me anything! I’m ready to answer any question you have!"
</p><br><p>"Ahem. This tavern is owned by Helasa, right?"
</p><br><p>Reyla’s eyes sparkled. "Of course! She’s the best boss I’ve ever had! Do you know her?"
</p><br><p>Adam shook his head. "Not exactly. She has a good relationship with a friend of mine, and he said I could turn to Helasa because she could help me with my problem. Is she here? I mean, can you help me get in touch with her?"
</p><br><p>After a few moments, Reyla nodded and leaned over. As she stood up, she held a wooden box with a mesh front that was unfamiliar to Adam. Inside the box was a simple-looking energy crystal.
</p><br><p>"Ms. Helasa, there’s a young man here who wants to talk to you!"
</p><br><p>There was no response, but Reyla was not fazed.
</p><br><p>"Ms. Helasa, there is a young man here who wants to talk to you!"
</p><br><p>She asked the same question several more times.
</p><br><p>"Can you hear me?" Reyla frowned slightly. "Maybe this box is broken?"
</p><br><br><p>A noise came from the other side as a deep, slightly irritated voice came from the box.
</p><br><p>"Agh, Reyla, I told you not to bother me!"
</p><br><p>After a few moments, the voice added:
</p><br><p>"A young man wants to meet me?"
</p><br><p>Reyla nodded vigorously. "Yes! He’s sitting right in front of me at the bar!"
</p><br><p>"Hmm... In your opinion, is he a handsome one?"
</p><br><p>Adam’s face froze. He was almost certain it was Helasa’s voice, so he didn’t think that would be the first question she would ask.
</p><br><p>Moreover, Reyla reacted to it quite seriously as she leaned in, studying Adam’s face intently.
</p><br><p>"I would say he’s much taller than average and... his appearance. There’s something unusual about it. He seems completely pure."
</p><br><p>For Helasa, this was the key moment.
</p><br><p>"Hmm? Unusual appearance? Alright, bring him to me and make a couple of my favorite cocktails!"
</p><br><p>Reyla jumped up as if she were a soldier receiving orders from an officer.
</p><br>
