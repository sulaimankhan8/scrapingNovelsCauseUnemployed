            <br><p>"Classified information...?" Silvana muttered, not knowing how to react.</p><br><p>Many different emotions came up inside her, and finally, some Phantom chose her, but such a message alarmed her. She didn't know what it was related to or what it threatened her with.</p><br><br><p>A happy smile appeared on Silvana's face, her emotions rushing out.</p><br><p>"It doesn't matter what will be required of me, the most important thing is that this day has finally arrived!"</p><br><p>With an excited expression, practically hopping, Silvana headed to the far side of the Fort Norton.</p><br><p>When she reached the correct door, she cleared her throat and made as serious a face as possible.</p><br><br><p>The door opened, letting Silvana inside.</p><br><p>A middle-aged woman was already waiting for her at the wide iron desk, she had long blonde hair and a hard stare. Her strict black outfit indicated that she was a high-ranking military officer.</p><br><p>The woman slowly raised her gaze before pointing to the chair across from her:</p><br><p>"Silvana Desio, have a seat. Not the most common event happened today, and coincidentally, now you're involved in it as well."</p><br><p>Sensing the tension emanating from the military, Silvana nodded timidly and did as she said.</p><br><p>"As you've already realized, you've finally been assigned to a Phantom. I'm sure you're excited, it's a celebration for every Operator, but this is a special occasion."</p><br><p>Silvana was confused.</p><br><p>"What...? What do you mean? I'm not fit to be an Operator for Adam Vinter?"</p><br><p>Her first thought was that the problem was her since she had been summoned to speak.</p><br><p>The woman waved her hand powerfully.</p><br><p>"No. It's not you, it's this Phantom. First of all, it's a K0-Phantom."</p><br><p>"Isn't that a good thing...?" Silvana suggested uncertainly, "If being a K0-Phantom he was given the opportunity to get an Operator then he's already proven his abilities in challenging missions."</p><br><p>The woman smirked ironically as she crossed her arms over her chest.</p><br><p>"You say all the right things, but not this time. There's another case in which a K0-Phantom can get an Operator and... in this case, it's a Phantom completely inexperienced, who hasn't been on a single mission and has never even gone through the preparatory academy."</p><br><p>As an Operator, Silvana was well aware of the path Phantoms went through, she had studied the subject on her own, and the Academy devoted a lot of time to it. But... she couldn't understand what the woman was talking about.</p><br><p>"Your puzzlement is understandable. Silvana, you noticed that one word was blocked in the message, right?"</p><br><p>"Yes... Is it something important?"</p><br><p>"Sure. It's one of the secrets of the Citadel and... Since Adam Vinter decided to choose you, you'll learn something you shouldn't given your level."</p><br><p>Then, the woman leaned forward, narrowed her eyebrows, piercing Silvana with a hard stare.</p><br><p>"Silvana Desio, you were lied to at the Academy, as there is another kind of Phantom, and... Adam Vinter is one of them."</p><br><p>Adam, leaning against the wall, raised an eyebrow in slight surprise.</p><br><p>'Damn, so she found out about it that very day? The military doesn't procrastinate.'</p><br><p>Silvana hadn't yet fully realized that this put her slightly above other Operators of her level. After all, how powerful an Operator was was determined by its Phantom, even at the earliest stages.</p><br><p>Thirty minutes later, Silvana blinked a few times, running her fingers over and over.</p><br><p>"Naturalborn Phantom... He killed a monster one-on-one at the Dead Lands... Fuck, that's incredible. I didn't even know such a thing existed." Experience new stories with My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><br><p>Having dealt with the main issue, the woman took out a lighter from her pocket and lit a thick cigarette.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you shouldn't have, but Adam Vinter is your Phantom now. Is there anything else you want to ask before you meet him?"</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>"W-Wait! Adam Vinter...? He's here? I mean... Right now?!" Silvana exclaimed nervously.</p><br><p>Her reaction amused Adam.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, just look how nervous she is, that day I was as calm as ancient ice."</p><br><p>Adam ran his hand over the back of his head with a contorted face:</p><br><p>"Although... what else was I supposed to feel after going through a fuck up like that?"</p><br><p>Taking a long puff and letting out a puff of smoke, the woman nodded.</p><br><p>"Yes. In the other compartment, he's talking to Douglas right now. So it won't be long before you two meet, I'd prepare if I were you, that guy's been through a lot today."</p><br><p>Silvana lowered her head, clenching her fists tightly, she was trembling slightly.</p><br><p>"And... How am I supposed to treat him? I know what he went through to survive."</p><br><p>The woman shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Well, you only have two options if you want to get some kind of reaction. You can be very soft and caring, or you can be the opposite - cold and stern. Before you decide, you should know that Adam Vinter chose you even though Douglas introduced you as the second type."</p><br><p>"I see. Then we'll get right to work. There's no point in remembering the tragedy, we must work on the future!"</p><br><p>"That's your business."</p><br><p>Then, shaking off the ashes, the woman looked away:</p><br><p>"You are free to go. I have nothing more to say to you except good luck. Every Phantom deserves a good Operator, just as every Operator needs a decent Phantom."</p><br><p>Silvana smiled weakly as she stood up, bowed low, and walked out heading straight for her Phantom.</p><br><p>Adam walked quickly behind her, realizing that this would be the moment they would meet.</p><br><p>"Well, I've seen that before." Adam muttered, watching as Silvana opened the door and faced Adam's gaze for the first time.</p><br><br><p>Adam waved his hand, speeding up the memories. He'd seen a lot of things from that moment himself, and in the times when Silvana was alone nothing of the same magnitude as his story with Kai had happened.</p><br><p>At some points, Adam's eyes darkened when he saw moments after failed missions on Silvana's part. She cried a lot and relived her failures.</p><br><br><p>Silvana whispered wiping her tears with her hand, a little after the battle against Essence Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>"I blamed my father for not believing in me, but... I did the same thing myself. But unlike my father, I was trained to trust my Phantom completely... It must never happen again."</p><br><p>Day after day, Adam saw similar scenes that were in his memory as well, but only from the other side. Sure, he'd seen quite a few interesting things, especially at the Gray Castle, during his three-month training, but it was all within his expectations.</p><br><p>Sure, he understood Silvana a little better as he saw things that were previously unknown to him. The same thing happened to Silvana, it was a small, practically imperceptible change, but it affected a lot of things deep inside.</p><br><br><p>Memories stopped at the moment Adam and Silvana entered the White Cube.</p><br><p>"Well, stage two has passed, but there's still something left isn't there?"</p><br><p>Adam muttered looking into the void, at the darkness behind which hid his Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>"And... even I don't know what awaits her. What does it take to complete Gene Diffusion?"</p><br><p>At his whisper, the memories shattered into small particles, once again plunging his and Silvana's minds into a deep sleep.</p>
