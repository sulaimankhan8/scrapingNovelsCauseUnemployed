            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1150: Path Construct (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>The last thing Lyrod saw was Adam activating his Nexus and disappearing from his field of vision. The crimson burst, and Adam appeared right in front of Lyrod, trying to withstand the power of his ability.</p><br><p>It seemed like he had nothing to worry about since he had only activated two of the five rings, but Adam was still only at the beginning of the K4-Level.</p><br><p>Even a single second of such power could seriously harm him, and that’s exactly what happened.</p><br><p>Red threads constantly emanated from his arm as his flesh was torn to pieces while his fist remained tightly clenched.</p><br><p>If it weren’t for the sword seal, by the time Adam was in front of Lyrod, only bone and a few tendons would have remained of his arm, with no muscle or skin. Only thanks to his superior regeneration was he able to carry out his attack without suffering terrible wounds.</p><br><br><p>Lyrod watched as his spear was about to pierce Adam, who was still standing in the distance. But… as soon as his eyes dropped down because something touched his chest, fear covered his face.</p><br><p>The speed with which Adam appeared in front of Lyrod showed that while Adam’s Nexus had two rings activated, he was one level higher than Lyrod, even though this power was only available to him for a few short seconds.</p><br><p>“Goodbye, Lyrod. Unfortunately, you don’t deserve the same place in my memory as my strongest opponents. But… I am grateful to you for the power you have revealed to me.”</p><br><p>Before Lyrod could respond, a bright red light covered the Corrosive Lakes lands as the crimson blast erupted from Adam’s palm.</p><br><p>The dense energy ray burned a hole the size of a massive cannonball in Lyrod’s torso, continuing to destroy everything in its path.</p><br><p>The ray passed through several dark hills behind him, leaving tunnels with melted edges and smoldering coals.</p><br><p>If Adam had had a little more power, it is quite possible that his ray would have reached the borders of the territory bordering the Corrosive Lakes, but there was no point in going there.</p><br><p>He had taken on the mission and completed it.</p><br><p>Adam had achieved not only the Citadel’s goals but his own as well, for he had not been mistaken.</p><br><p>Lyrod would be his first step on the path to new power, to something truly new and not the part hidden by the First Star’s energy. His artifact and Silvana’s second ability had belonged to him from the very beginning.</p><br><br><p>Thick blood dripped from Lyrod’s mouth as his hate-filled gaze was ready to pierce Adam through and through.</p><br><p>Unlike Kyros, the Crimson Monarch, and Arnoth, Lyrod was not ready to accept his death with dignity.</p><br><p>When he came to this land, Adam took everything he had. Sure, Lyrod didn’t care much about Dayra and Kolos’s lives, but they were his Elders and subordinates who would carry out his orders and help him become stronger.</p><br><br><p>That was what Lyrod wanted most. He was tired of seeing Lords who commanded hundreds or even thousands of monsters. His main dream was to move to the Dark Shore and one day, after several World Wipes, take the leading position at the Befallen Crown.</p><br><p>But what did he get in the end?</p><br><p>Nothing but a hole in his chest, and he had no way to fix it.</p><br><p>All he could do was try to take Adam with him straight to hell.</p><br><br><p>Lyrod’s hands tightened around Adam’s neck in an attempt to strangle him.</p><br><p>Lyrod’s veins were ready to burst from the rage overflowing inside him, but… Adam didn’t even resist.</p><br><p>With every heartbeat, Lyrod’s grip grew weaker and the blood in his body grew less.</p><br><p>The last thing to disappear was the malice in his eyes, and only then did he breathe his last breath.</p><br><br><p>Lyrod collapsed to the ground under Adam’s emotionless gaze.</p><br><p>He had enjoyed some moments of their fight, but he had no right to consider Lyrod worthy.</p><br><p>“Yeah…” Adam nodded weakly in confirmation of his thoughts. “That would be an insult to you, wouldn’t it?”</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, Adam looked up at the dark sky, behind which a bright glow resembling the moon was hidden.</p><br><p>Adam collapsed to his knees, sinking into the silence of the Tarnished Lands. He had nothing to worry about, for there was no one left at the Corrosive Lakes who could pose a threat to him.</p><br><p>“You did it…” Silvana’s voice rang out as she smiled slightly.</p><br><p>“Of course I am. However, if it weren’t for the First Star energy, we would have had problems… Lyrod doesn’t have abilities as impressive as the Crimson Monarch or Arnoth, but he was actually much stronger than I in a level matter.”</p><br><p>Then, Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>“Hah, your ability. It was unexpected, but it was exactly what I needed.”</p><br><br><p>Silvana didn’t say anything for a while.</p><br><p>“Is something wrong?”</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head.</p><br><p>“No, just… I don’t know what that ability was originally, but you’re right, the First Star created the abilities we needed.”</p><br><p>“Hah, something like that. My artifact and your second ability, the crown and the heart… Damn, that level of risk is uncomfortable even for me.”</p><br><p>Silvana tilted her head.</p><br><p>“Maybe it’s time to think about a defensive ability?”</p><br><p>In response, Adam shrugged, preparing to leave the Corrosive Lakes.</p><br><p>“Nah, that would ruin everything. I’d have to restrain myself because of one ability. Although, I have no idea what’s hidden in my Nexus.”</p><br><p>“Not just in it…” Silvana muttered, remembering the foundation of their future power.</p><br><p>Adam’s face grew serious.</p><br><p>“Are you talking about that mysterious black orb?”</p><br><p>“Ughum.” She nodded.</p><br><p>Adam exhaled cold breath as he looked at the lake in the distance.</p><br><p>“We’ll have to figure out what this thing is. I’ve evolved very quickly, but there’s not much time left… considering what I have to do.”</p><br><p>At the same time, unnoticed by Adam and Silvana, the Evolution Tree trembled along with the black orb, sensing the dark energy emanating from Lyrod’s body.</p>
