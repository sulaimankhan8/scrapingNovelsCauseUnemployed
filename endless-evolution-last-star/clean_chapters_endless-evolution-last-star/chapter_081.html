            <br><br><p>The gloves are ideal for one who is used to working with a needle, providing excellent protection for the weaver's hands and increasing the overall strength and speed of the needle through the connection of the threads into a single intertwining system.</p><br><p>First Trait - First Melody: Soul Cry</p><br><p>Second Trait - Silver Swirl]</p><br><p>Adam's Second Trait of his Nexus had only appeared a few seconds ago, but he was already using it, his targets were not monsters - but humans. Well... there was no telling if they were worthy of being called humans after what they'd done.</p><br><p>Then, something changed in Adam, for his internal morality barrier had broken. The silver bullet that killed Barna shattered the glass wall in his mind, separating the simple young man from the slums and the powerful Phantom who could survive in the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>Mirna, the most experienced of the dark Phantoms squad, recognized this immediately in Adam's gaze. Several times in her life, she had seen something like this before, and each time, it had led to only one thing - disaster.</p><br><br><p>Electric shocks ran through Adam's legs as he swept past Mirna, heading for the nearest Phantom in his path.</p><br><p>"No! Dodge! Fuck! Run as fast as you can!" Mirna exclaimed with a worried face. Her arrogance and complete confidence in her impunity had vanished, for now everything was serious.</p><br><p>A spinning sphere of hundreds of threads rained down on the Phantom's face, slicing it into tiny pieces in a split second. The man's head seemed to have accidentally fallen right into a meat grinder with fast and extremely sharp blades.</p><br><p>Silver Swirl dispelled, but Adam's attack didn't end there. He could use the Second Trait of his Nexus once more, for it was a two-stage attack, and the first one required little energy since it was a single-target attack. The second stage would be just as energy-consuming as Zera's ability.</p><br><p>Adam defeated the Prime King quickly enough, but he had spent a lot of energy and abilities, so he couldn't afford to use the full power of the Silver Swirl.</p><br><p>"Shit! Kill the others! I'll take this bastard on!" Mirna exclaimed, dropping the case, swiftly opening it, and pulling out her Nexus.</p><br><p>It was a long halberd with a black hilt and a straight purple blade with three iron rings at the beginning, just like the one at the end of the hilt.</p><br><p>Adam didn't have enough energy for Silver Swirl or Thunder Punishment, but he could always summon his Order.</p><br><p>The silver, binding thread went through the girl's shoulder, cutting off her arm and causing her to scream in pain.</p><br><p>All but Mirna were K0-Phantoms, so against Adam, they didn't stand a chance. He only needed one successful attack to end their lives. To him, they were no stronger than green threat level monsters.</p><br><p>Adam stepped forward, swinging the needle, he was going to cut off the girl's head with it, the only obstacle was the girl's neck.</p><br><br><p>Mirna appeared behind the girl like a ghost, blocking the silver thread with the blade of her halberd. The six rings shuddered on impact, making a light sound that made Adam feel weaker for a moment.</p><br><p>"Run, stop standing here! I'm not going to protect you anymore, so you better get the fuck out of here unless you want to lose your life besides your arm!" Mirna shouted furiously, but the concern was clearly audible in her voice.</p><br><p>The girl nodded, holding the open wound from bleeding ran forward.</p><br><p>Mirna smiled. She had already lost two members of her squad, but at least she was able to save one badly injured one.</p><br><br><p>A lightning arrow flew into the neck of the girl, who already had a happy smile on her face.</p><br><p>Droplets of blood flew off to the side, passing in front of Mirna's eyes, quickly opening wide.</p><br><p>Adam turned around, he was dazed too because the one who had shot was Mark - the youngest, kindest, and most naive in their squad.</p><br><p>Tears were streaming from his eyes, his teeth were clenched tightly, and his hands were trembling, but he held his bow steady. What he had done was like committing a mortal sin to him, however, he had to, because Mark didn't want anyone else to die.</p><br><p>"BASTARD!!! I'LL BURY YOU ALIVE!!!"</p><br><p>Mirna screamed in rage, as her hair whipped up.</p><br><p>She quickly ran forward, preparing to cut Mark in two with a swing of her halberd.</p><br><p>A wide shadow cast over Mirna's world as, for some reason, Mark began to move away from her, though he stood motionless in his spot.</p><br><p>"I am your opponent. K1 vs K1. All's fair." Adam said confidently, grabbing Mirna's head and bringing her to the ground.</p><br><p>"Agh!" Mirna yelped in pain before rapidly standing up and glaring at Adam.</p><br><p>She swung the halberd menacingly, pointing the sharp tip of the blade directly at him.</p><br><p>"Do you really think you can handle me? Even if you defeat the Prime King, it means nothing to me except that you're exhausted!"</p><br><p>"That doesn't matter. What are you suggesting I should do? Make a deal with you? After everything that's already happened?" Adam narrowed his eyes.</p><br><br><p>"You can say nothing, it doesn't matter. If I make a deal after you killed Barna, I'll never be able to look at myself in the mirror again. We fight now, today is the end of it." Adam said confidently, taking measured breaths.</p><br><p>He was willing to do whatever was necessary to win. Adam didn't know if the Phantoms were all like this in the Lower Ring, or if they had run into outlaws. It didn't matter.</p><br><p>Adam decided to concentrate on two things - avenging Barna and protecting the remaining Phantoms of the Travelers Squad.</p><br><p>Katrin, Sirgus, Mark, and Kody were also facing a challenge, because there were four of them and five Phantoms against them, and another one was hiding somewhere!</p><br><p>It was the shooter that killed Barna, that Phantom was the main target of their squad.</p>
