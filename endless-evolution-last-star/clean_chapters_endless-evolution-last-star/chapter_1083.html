            <br><p>Chapter 1083: Great Snake (Part 1)<br>
The final piece of the Third Key, the Twilight Crystal – proved to be both a curse and a blessing for Adam.</p><br><p>It was a rare opportunity that could only be obtained if certain conditions were met. Adam didn’t know where his battles against the Hollow Wave monsters would take him, but he was in his place in large part because of it.</p><br><p>Despite what was going on above, Adam and Lexa had successfully made it to the Twilight Crystal, they had reached their destination, and it seemed that now Adam only had to wait a little while before he could return home.</p><br><p>Once the Third Key absorbed all of the Twilight Crystal’s energy, Adam would be able to escape from the Dark Shore. It was the only way for him to return to a place where his power meant something.</p><br><p>Normally, this would take a few minutes since everything else was ready. He and his Evolution Tree were waiting to move on to the next stage.</p><br><p>But… the Befallen Crown knew this as well.</p><br><p>Phantoms like Adam were quite a few, but he wasn’t the only one the First Star had brought to the Dark Shore so he could absorb its shard.</p><br><p>Not ten seconds later, the three Lords who had been waiting for this opportunity were in front of Adam.</p><br><p>The dozens of meters of ground between them were no barrier to such powerful monsters. They knew where he was, so now nothing could stop them.</p><br><p>“No! You dare not interfere with the First Star’s will!” Lexa’s eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>As soon as she reached out and tried to stand up, the auras of the Lords nailed her to the ground, preventing her from even moving.</p><br><p>The energy from the Twilight Crystal protected Adam, allowing him to stand on his feet, though with great difficulty.</p><br><p>However, it was obvious that this was the end for him. He couldn’t survive even one attack. Saegar and Kenward were too far away to help him.</p><br><p>“Phantom… You’ve managed to reach this far, too far.”</p><br><p>The man stepped forward, and a wave of energy ran through his hand like a blade.</p><br><p>“It’s time to put an end to this! A threat to all monsters!”</p><br><br><p>Two emerald eyes opened amidst the darkness as the great shadow roared forward. Before Adam realized it, the three great Lords disappeared into the jaws of the magnificent creature.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>An active shudder ran across the ground as Adam’s shocked face reflected in the monster’s countless dark scales.</p><br><p>Soon, light illuminated his face as pebbles fell on his shoulders.</p><br><p>Seeing this opportunity, Lexa tore towards him and spread her wings wide. She took Adam by the shoulders and flew high up.</p><br><p>Neither of them knew what had just happened, but it was obvious that staying down was dangerous. Lexa had to do everything in her power to help Adam, since at the moment, he was the bearer of the Twilight Crystal.</p><br><br><p>Climbing out of the ravine, Lexa soared above the surface.</p><br><p>The battlefield opened before Adam’s eyes, Saegar and the multitude of Lords surrounding him. Kenward, on his horse, hovered over the island and two wary Lords, some of the strongest among the backup.</p><br><p>Ruined lands and even hiding monsters in the distance, watching the fate of their lands.</p><br><p>But, in an instant, all of this ceased to matter in Adam’s eyes, simply faded into the background since he saw something far more important.</p><br><p>A great snake, much larger than Heret and Vorx’s monster forms, hovered above the ground. Green flames and darkness covered its intimidating frame as its eyes were narrowed in slight indifference.</p><br><p>The three Lords were trapped in the snake’s jaws, unable to get out and resist.</p><br><p>On the snake’s head sat a man in a suit, his hair was black, descending over his pale skin, and his green eyes were as deep as those of a sage.</p><br><p>A lone cigarette was clutched between his fingers, a trickle of smoke passing in front of his calm face.</p><br><p>“What the…?” Adam stammered.</p><br><p>It wasn’t just the sudden rescue he hadn’t counted on.</p><br><p>No, it was much simpler than that.</p><br><br><p>The man took his next drag, blowing out a puff of smoke as his eyes lowered to Adam.</p><br><p>“Well, hello, Adam Vinter,” Wilfred said in a carefree voice.</p><br><p>Then, he glanced at his snake.</p><br><br><br><p>Without a moment’s hesitation, the snake slammed its jaw shut, trapping the three Lords in a cage from which they would never escape.</p><br><p>The snake’s eyes flashed as streams of green flame came out of the gaps in its jaw. Everything inside turned into a fiery inferno, turning the three Lords who tried to resist into nothing more than handfuls of ash.</p><br><p>“Girl.” Wilfred turned his gaze to Lexa. “Are you a follower of the Free End?”</p><br><p>Lexa hesitated. She hadn’t yet decided for herself which faction she should join.</p><br><p>Still, she knew what to answer.</p><br><p>“The First Star! I follow its will!”</p><br><p>Wilfred nodded deeply. “I see. Good for you.”</p><br><br><p>Before Lexa knew it, the snake’s tail slammed into her, throwing her dozens of meters aside.</p><br><p>The series of collisions hurt her badly, but she had to be grateful to both her faith and Wilfred.</p><br><p>He attacked weakly enough for her to survive.</p><br><p>Adam collapsed to the ground as the snake headed toward him, peering curiously at the Phantom, its master decided to save.</p><br><p>“Come on, get in. I’m not going to be your babysitter and watch your every move.”</p><br><p>Acting almost on instinct, Adam rushed forward, climbing onto the great snake. As soon as he was next to Wilfred, he pulled a cigarette out of the pack and held one out to Adam.</p><br><p>Before Adam could reply, Wilfred threw him a dagger-sharp stare.</p><br><p>“If you refuse, I’ll drop you and walk out of here alone.”</p><br><p>Adam gulped, taking a cigarette even though he didn’t know how to smoke, he’d never done it.</p><br><p>And… This wasn’t the right place for that at all!</p><br><p>But it didn’t seem to bother Wilfred in the least. Unlike Adam, for whom every event at the Dark Shore could end in death, Wilfred had a different situation.</p><br><p>He was the one who brought that death.</p>
