            <br><p>The can of beer flew across the table ending up in Adam's tight grip.</p><br><p>Unlike the dinners at Erik's house, the table wasn't covered with various, hot dishes. Orel was definitely capable of that considering what position he held.</p><br><p>No matter if it was the Lower Ring or the Upper Ring, K4-Phantom possessed immense wealth and resources either way. Even among ordinary people, there were rich and powerful people everywhere, not to mention K4-Phantom, the frontiers of the First Circle.</p><br><p>But, this was not an official meeting. Adam wasn't sure if anyone other than Orel and Risha knew of his presence at the Red Tower.</p><br><p>There were various snacks on the table, as well as beer, lots of beer.</p><br><br><p>Orel opened the lighter, igniting a cigarette before exhaling a puff of smoke.</p><br><p>Adam silently opened a can of beer and looked to the right of Orel.</p><br><br><p>He pointed to a girl in a black dress, she had short shoulder-length black hair and calm eyes that knew how to behave in such company.</p><br><p>Orel smirked as he waved his hand towards the girl.</p><br><p>"This is Misa, she's my Operator. I'm surprised you're curious about this. At the Upper Ring getting an Operator is a lot easier than here, you know?"</p><br><p>'Hmm...' Adam hummed. 'Misa, right? Well, I can't say she looks like some slave or victim. If I hadn't heard so much crap from Risha and those three thugs, I'd see her as a regular Operator playing number two in their couple.'</p><br><p>'But...' his eyes twitched to Misa's hand. There was a small red bracelet on her wrist, but for some reason, it looked more like a shackle than jewelry.</p><br><p>''What is that? Are the Phantoms of the Lower Ring unable to get their Operator through natural methods?" Adam frowned pointing at the bracelet.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Orel was not the first to react to his demand.</p><br><p>"Don't say that," Misa uttered sternly, drilling him with a glare. "You don't know how things work around here, especially not how little you know about the way the relationship between Phantoms and Operators functions."</p><br><p>Misa raised her hand so that everyone could see her bracelet.</p><br><p>"This is proof that Orel has complete trust in me and that we have reached a Harmony. I am happy to be Orel's Operator and am pleased with the way he treats me and the way our relationship is progressing. I am well aware that at the Upper Ring, the dynamic between Phantoms and Operators is completely different, but we live in two different worlds."</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana gulped. Misa's voice was serious as if she were in court, and her gaze stern like that of a teacher who taught his stupid students basic things.</p><br><p>To her, Adam's reaction and his tone were actually offensive.</p><br><p>"Harmony? No, what's important right now is something else. Why do you need that bracelet? And... How did you reach your point? I mean, did your relationship develop the same way as mine with Silvana? Like most of the Phantoms/Operators at the Upper Ring?" Adam asked, curiosity burning in his eyes.</p><br><br><p>Orel ate his chips, interrupting their conversation with a loud crunch.</p><br><p>"Well, well, that's a lot of questions. What do you think, Misa, should we answer them?"</p><br><p>Misa smiled, laying her head on Orel's shoulder, her hand traveling down his thigh. "Sure, these two are like lambs fallen into a den of wolves, innocent and clueless."</p><br><p>"Hah, good comparison, but..." Orel's eyes stopped on Adam. "He doesn't look like a lamb at all. If I hadn't intervened he would have killed Risha, no doubt about it."</p><br><p>"Pffft!" Risha snorted, who with a loud pop opened a second can of beer. "He just caught me off guard. Next time I'll win!"</p><br><p>Orel's eyes narrowed, a dangerous glint running through. "Shut up. There won't be a next time - you're dead. At least it would happen to any other person in your place."</p><br><p>Risha growled, but didn't say anything; she silently looked away.</p><br><p>Then, Orel leaned back in his chair, drumming on the table.</p><br><p>"Hmm... Where to start?" his eyes darted to Adam and Silvana. "Well, since you're so interested in Misa's bracelet, let's talk about it and the Operators in general. Misa, would you be so kind and bring the old puzzles we did a while back? They'll help me explain everything."</p><br><p>"Sure," she purred as her hands ran down Orel's chest.</p><br><p>Saying nothing, Adam focused, going to listen intently to Orel.</p><br><p>"Anyway, like Misa said - the bracelet is a good option."</p><br><p>Adam's eyebrow went up. "What, the good one? What's the bad one in that case?"</p><br><p>"Hah, if Risha's Operator were here you'd see that, although Misa was in the same situation a while back - she wore a collar."</p><br><p>"C-Collar...? Like a dog's?" Adam stammered.</p><br><p>Orel nodded deeply taking a sip.</p><br><p>Silvana gulped. She couldn't help but imagine herself in Misa's role. In her mind's eye, she appeared in a collar, just for a second but it was enough to make her face turn as red as a tomato.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you could say that. I mean, they're special collars, you don't buy them at the pet store, but there's not much difference in general. The collar and bracelet have two purposes, one for protection and one for control."</p><br><p>Orel pointed two fingers before continuing.</p><br><p>"Once you were at the Lower Ring you were immediately attacked. Sure, the most valuable in their eyes was Silvana. She's a beautiful, young girl so they could definitely sell her to some brothel, maybe some rich freak or even a lonely Phantom looking for a replacement after failing with the last Operator.</p><br><p>"They realized she was an Operator pretty late and the reason isn't just because they're idiots, but because they didn't see her wearing a collar or bracelet. At the Upper Ring, every Operator has one thing."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam was puzzled. "What about the free Operators? What's the point of them wearing a bracelet, much less a collar?"</p><br><p>An ironic smile showed on Orel's face as he shook his head.</p><br><p>"Free Operators? Hah, Adam, those don't exist. Here at the Lower Ring, there are far fewer Operators than Phantoms."</p>
