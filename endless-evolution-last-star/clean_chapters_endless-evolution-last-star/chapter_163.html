            <br><p>Lola's eyes went wide, though she wasn't the only one with that reaction. One couldn't blame her, what Edir had done was not at all like a prisoner fighting against a Guardian, however, it wasn't like a couple solving their problems either.</p><br><p>"Hey, how are you feeling? That was a pretty good fight, wasn't it?" Edir smirked, looking at Crita.</p><br><p>Crita was slowly coming to her senses, and the first thing she noticed was Edir's hand on her ass. It seemed Edir wasn't going to stop enjoying her firmness.</p><br><p>"Have you no shame at all?!" Crita exclaimed, waving her arms and legs with a flushed face.</p><br><p>Edir lifted his chin, then abruptly lowered his head, almost colliding with Crita's foreheads. His narrowed eyes were directly in front of her, and the tips of his hair fell over her cheeks as if trying to hide her embarrassed face from view.</p><br><p>"Do you mind? Just say the word, and I'll stop right now, and even put you on the ground. You know, I respect my partner's wishes. But... We both know that's not going to happen, don't we?" Edir whispered, in a sly voice.</p><br><p>In fact, Edir wasn't lying. It was enough for Crita to ask him to stop and he would do it, but Crita just turned aside and muttered:</p><br><p>"Just take me outside the gate, and that's it. Stop making this mess. You know me too well."</p><br><p>"As you wish princess." Edir smirked, making Crita blush even more. No one had ever addressed her like that except Edir, and he knew perfectly well that it was her weakness.</p><br><p>However, he was in no hurry to leave, because there was someone else, who intended to go to the S-Zone.</p><br><p>Stay with m _v _l _e _mp _y _r.</p><br><p>"Hey, how much time do you need?" Edir turned around, speaking to Adam, who was watching him intently.</p><br><p>Adam glared at him and simply pointed a single finger before confidently stepping toward the first prisoner he saw.</p><br><br><p>The ground at Adam's step shook, causing his next victim to shiver. It was a regular prisoner of the A-Zone who was watching the fight with a cocktail in hand.</p><br><p>"Wait! Take your time. I surrender, you can have your cell." The man put his hands up. He had no desire to fight, especially when the chances of winning were very slim.</p><br><p>Adam looked at his card, nodded, and headed for the dark gate.</p><br><p>Lola looked back and quickly followed him. She was with Adam from the F-Zone, and she was going to go all the way to the end because the finals were near.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the arena platform rose, revealing Edir carrying Crita in his arms.</p><br><p>He lowered her to the ground only when they reached the gate.</p><br><p>"Hopefully, there won't be a problem with him going through as well, right?" Edir asked, pointing at Adam.</p><br><p>Crita threw him a stern and cold stare, not the way she looked at Edir.</p><br><p>"Even if it's you asking for it... I can't go against the rules. However, I can pass judgment in other ways. You, release your aura, but without Spirit, just show your pure power." Crita said menacingly, pointing at Adam.</p><br><p>"Fine." Adam nodded with a calm face.</p><br><p>He didn't want to fight against Crita, especially after learning about the additional circumstances. If he could pass on simply by releasing his aura, then it was a great deal.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a threatening aura began to emerge from Adam's body like a white-hot flame seeking to consume everything around it.</p><br><p>Crita released her aura as well, dark and sharp as lightning. The two auras collided, and gradually Adam's aura engulfed Crita's, putting serious pressure on her.</p><br><p>Until Edir swung his hand, splashing the black and white auras with a blue one.</p><br><p>"Hey, that was enough, wasn't it?" Edir asked with a sly smile.</p><br><p>Crita nodded uncertainly. She didn't want to show it, but she didn't expect Adam's aura to be so strong.</p><br><p>"Alright, then we're off." Edir waved his hand, heading towards the dark gate that had already opened.</p><br><p>Crita wanted to say something but hesitated due to her timidity, and Edir beat her.</p><br><p>"I'll be out of here soon, and we're going on a date that same day. Do you understand me?" Edir uttered, looking at her intently.</p><br><p>Crita nodded quickly a few times as if this opportunity would be lost if she didn't.</p><br><p>"And... Quit this dump already..." Edir muttered scratching the back of his head, "If you want, you can go on missions with me."</p><br><p>Crita's eyes opened wide with happiness because Edir had never wanted to take her on missions together in the Dead Lands before. His reasoning was very simple - Crita was too weak, and he didn't want to risk her life.</p><br><p>No one knew it yet, but it wouldn't be a couple of hours before Crita was writing her resignation letter. Now, she had no reason to be here and not in Dead Lands.</p><br><br><p>Adam, Lola, and Edir were heading for the S-Zone, which was accessed by a long but not very tall staircase.</p><br><p>The S-Zone was the highest point in Fall Hill Prison, except for the main building - if one got there, one could leave the prison safely, but one had to go through the S-Zone to get there.</p><br><p>"You two seem to have a very unusual relationship, don't you?" Adam asked, glancing at Edir.</p><br><p>"I wouldn't say that." Edir said relaxedly, holding his hands behind his head.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>Edir sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"Adam, every relationship is unique and has nuances, especially if it's a relationship between Phantoms and especially if, in your relationship, one is a prisoner and the other a guardian. I couldn't be completely sure about Crita before, because she always gave up halfway through."</p><br><p>Edir continued with a deep gaze, it was obvious, that this was actually important to him.</p><br><p>"She always wanted to go on missions together, but I knew that with an attitude like hers, sooner or later, tragedy would befall us. I'm not ready to lose someone close to me, you know? I'm ready to insult and offend, but to keep someone alive. That's a price worth paying."</p><br><p>Adam said nothing, he only nodded in agreement, though he didn't fully understand what Edir was talking about. He needed either time or to be in his shoes to completely understand.</p><br><p>Both - Edir and Crita were somewhat older than him and had more experience in areas where Adam was a complete novice.</p><br><p>"Lola... So what's in store for us in the S-Zone?" Adam asked, "Is there a Guardian we need to defeat?"</p><br><p>Lola took a deep breath, lowering her gaze to the floor.</p><br><p>"As I said earlier. Crita is the strongest Guardian, besides her, there are no other Guardians in this prison." Lola muttered.</p><br><p>"We have to defeat the Warden." Edir said sharply, not waiting for Lola to mention it.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"But... It's Prago... He's a K2-Phantom!" Adam waved his hand, realizing how slim their chances were.</p><br><p>"Yeah... That's why we won't be out of here until a week from now..." Edir sighed heavily, remembering how Prago had beaten him up last time.</p>
