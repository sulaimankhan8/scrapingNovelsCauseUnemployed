            <br><p>For most creatures, losing one's head was a mortal wound, since even monsters had a brain inside the skull, at least in most cases.</p><br><p>However, unlike humans, each monster species had a different physique and some were able to grow a new head, while for some losing their head was not a serious problem as it was just one head among many.</p><br><p>The Obsidian Hydra was one of those monsters. Silvana cut off one of the three heads, the left one, but the Obsidian Hydra had two more, this time the monster wouldn't let Silvana and Abel attack without getting seriously wounded in return.</p><br><p>'Are you okay?' Adam asked in a calm voice, 'Considering the size of the scissors, you should have spent a lot of energy.'</p><br><p>Silvana stepped forward, holding her massive scissors firmly in one hand.</p><br><p>"Don't worry about me. Rather tell me what Obsidian Hydra's weakness is?"</p><br><p>In response, Adam shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>'It's all right in front of your eyes - flesh or crystals. The choice is yours where to aim and what to attack. However, although the crystals are open, especially the main one, they're already part of the monster's body, so they should be very durable.'</p><br><p>Quickly glancing over the Obsidian Hydra with a keen gaze, Silvana stepped forward stopping her eyes on the massive crystal in the center.</p><br><p>"ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAARRRR!!!"</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Obsidian Hydra roared furiously, raising its head high and widening its jaws.</p><br><p>The twelve crystals as well as the round one on the monster's chest shone brightly, sending energy throughout its body.</p><br><p>Silvana and Abel glanced around, they could attack right now, but it was too dangerous.</p><br><p>'Be careful, the Obsidian Hydra is attacking.' Adam's voice echoed in Silvana's ears.</p><br><p>Then, her eyes traveled upward, looking at the purple swirls forming near the Obsidian Hydra.</p><br><p>Explore more stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Soon, the swirls glowed brightly, launching a multitude of energy projectiles at Abel and Silvana.</p><br><p>Before the first projectile could reach its target, Abel appeared in front of Silvana, putting his shield forward.</p><br><br><p>A projectile slammed into the shield, vibrations traveling across the amber surface before the projectile shuddered.</p><br><br><p>All the energy from the projectile erupted in a massive explosion, throwing Abel aside. Silvana stayed where she was, Abel protected her, but the hydra's attack exceeded their expectations.</p><br><br><p>Silvana thought, her eyes running from one vortex to another, in a few seconds they would be ready to attack, the only condition was to accumulate enough energy.</p><br><p>'I thought Abel would easily be able to block a few projectiles at the very least, but it looks like they are much more powerful.'</p><br><p>By now, Abel already recovered from the explosion. He wasn't injured, but that couldn't be said for his shield, part of which simply wasn't there.</p><br><p>"Damn it! Why did it explode?" Abel exclaimed irritably as he swung his arm, directing energy towards the shield.</p><br><p>In a second the shield returned to normal, but Abel can't do that all the time, sooner or later his energy would run out.</p><br><p>"Hey, Silvana! I think this is my last chance to do any damage to the hydra, so try to just dodge for now, okay?" Abel shouted across half the cave.</p><br><p>At first, Silvana was confused by his request, but soon she noticed that even though the Obsidian Hydra had two heads, it was looking only at her, none of its four eyes were directed at Abel.</p><br><p>With a gesture, Silvana showed that she was ready before bouncing back. The next moment, an energy projectile flew into the spot, exploding a few meters in front of her.</p><br><p>"Good." Abel took a deep breath before raising his hammer high.</p><br><p>Normal attacks couldn't seriously hurt Obsidian Hydra, at least not from his hammer, Abel was well aware of that, but he hadn't used his Nexus once yet.</p><br><p>"I only have one ability, but... I'm sure it will be enough to contribute to the victory."</p><br><p>With a powerful flow of energy bubbling within him, Abel's eyes shone brightly like powerful lanterns, the light traveled up his arm, alongside the hammer reaching the nine-pointed star.</p><br><p>Absorbing bits of light into itself, the star erupted in an amber flash, releasing a wide golden beam upwards as if it descended from the heavens.</p><br><p>Three similar beams but much narrower appeared above him, Silvana and Talna, leaving a ghostly star mark on their left hands.</p><br><p>Soon, the beams disappeared but not the one emanating from Abel's hammer.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A golden ring large enough to cover part of the cave appeared above Obsidian Hydra, opening a portal for a beam of burning light.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide as she watched the cruel golden beam rain down upon Obsidian Hydra, a holy punishment.</p><br><p>"ROOOOAAAAAAAAAARRRR!!!!"</p><br><p>A painful shriek once again erupted from Obsidian Hydra, this time from only two heads out of three of the remaining ones.</p><br><p>A light ray, like flame burned through Obsidian Hydra's protective scales, reaching the skin and flesh hiding beneath several layers.</p><br><p>Abel confidently maintained his posture, holding his hammer high like a statue. Gradually, his gaze grew weaker, exhaustion catching up with him, but it seemed he could hold out longer than Obsidian Hydra under such pressure.</p><br><br><p>With the next roar, the three crystals on Obsidian Hydra shone brightly, creating a purple barrier of dense energy around it.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A scorching beam tried to break through the barrier, but all Abel could accomplish was to leave a few scratches on it, then the energy of his ability came to an end.</p><br><p>A trickle of blood dripped from the corner of his mouth as he fell to one knee, breathing heavily.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."</p><br><p>Abel closed his eyes for a few seconds, trying to regain consciousness, still clutching the hilt of his hammer tightly.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, he felt relief. Opening his eyes, Abel saw a bloody halo soaring above him, the same one that was above Silvana.</p><br><br><p>Talna stepped forward, with a serious face extending her arm forward.</p><br><p>"Come on, there's not much left. Either extinguish the nine crystals or chop off two heads. The choice is yours, Silvana."</p><br><p>Then, Talna's eyes flashed with crimson light, causing the ground to actively shake as if in a powerful earthquake.</p>
