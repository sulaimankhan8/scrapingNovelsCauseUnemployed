            <br><p>An energy pulse came from the Evolution Tree, sweeping along the space, making the vast darkness shiver like the smoothness of water.</p><br><p>[Adam...] the Evolution Tree proclaimed. [You're right... I've been holding back your energy until now, as creating the Foundation Artifact at Erik's mansion would be a major mistake.]</p><br><p>To begin with, Adam nodded silently.</p><br><p>'Right... When Silvana and I went through Gene Diffusion, and I got Operator's Star, Refesa mentioned something about my artifact. It seems that the Third Rarity is the final stage for the artifact's progression...'</p><br><p>A smirk showed on Adam's face as his eyes shone.</p><br><p>'Well, at least until my artifact turns into the Foundation Artifact, right?'</p><br><p>Then, Adam directed his gaze towards the Evolution Tree while the energy continued to condense around the two parts of his power.</p><br><p>[You could have opened your third lesser gates earlier... and perhaps in that case, you wouldn't have had trouble fighting against the S4 monster... The Inferno Serpent was strong and... that's very good.]</p><br><p>[Now, you can create the Foundation Artifact you need at this particular moment... There's nothing worse than a high-quality but useless weapon, is there?]</p><br><p>"Hah, is that really possible?" Adam tilted his head in confusion. "I mean, if it weren't for your help, my artifact and Elemental Root would have merged into the Foundation Artifact by now, right?"</p><br><p>[It is... correct...]</p><br><p>"Let's say you didn't supervise the process. My artifact and Elemental Root have great power. I don't believe that fusing them would create something weak," he said in a low voice.</p><br><p>[Hmm... I didn't say that... I said that the Foundation Artifact might get useless or of little use... If the fusion happens without control, the result will be random, but considering the peculiarities of the two components.]</p><br><p>Adam rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "What does that mean?"</p><br><p>[That the fusion of lightning and gravity can't produce an artifact with the power of fire or wind... it's logical...]</p><br><p>"I see..." he nodded deeply. "So, what do I need to do? How do I create the artifact I want? And... What do I want?"</p><br><p>Adam was confused. He wasn't prepared for the opening of the third lesser gates in the middle of battle. He didn't have time to think.</p><br><p>[Hah... That's not my problem, Adam... In thirty seconds, the flaming orbs will turn you to ash. Well... in the real world, it would happen much faster.]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree trembled, its strength was at its limit.</p><br><p>[Anyway... You have half a minute to make a decision. After that, I will release the artifact and the Elemental Root... When they collide, there will be a shockwave that will shake the entire inner space and instantly destroy the third lesser gates and third orb... As you can see... these gates are already at their limit.]</p><br><p>"WHAT?" Adam waved his hand in outrage. "Only half a minute? I didn't even know I had to think about it until now! How do I know what ability I need? I need everything and nothing at the same time!"</p><br><p>However, the Evolution Tree was not going to answer his questions, it had no time for his complaints.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree was busy with something else: explaining the rules.</p><br><p>[Nevertheless... If you find yourself between the artifact and the Elemental Root at the moment of collision, you will take control of them just like of the stream from the third lesser gates...]</p><br><p>"And?" Adam heavily grimaced. "Then what?"</p><br><p>[You will have less than a second to fuse the artifact and the Elemental Root into the Foundation Artifact... Everything will happen just as you imagined it... following your desires...]</p><br><p>[Of course, you'll become stronger as a Phantom as well... The effect of the Stellar Flow will work immediately, but the creation of the Foundation Artifact is your main task.]</p><br><p>"Fine, I have no other choice anyway," Adam waved his hand irritably, and then he looked at Lone Blaze and Moira. "Any ideas?"</p><br><p>He only had twenty seconds left. Enough to hear a few options.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze gulped, tentatively suggesting. "Maybe create some sort of battle mode? You'll become faster and stronger, enough to dodge flaming orbs and fight against your opponent as an equal. It would be a worthy weapon in your future battles as well."</p><br><p>Pushing away from the darkness, Moira shrugged. "I don't know. How about something more substantial?"</p><br><p>"Hm?" Adam bit down on a finger. "Speak plainly, I don't have much time!"</p><br><p>"Agh..." she rolled her eyes. "Alright. Your artifact is one or, at most, two mighty lightning blades, and your Elemental Root is two powerful punches. I suggest compacting your firepower to the limit. Compress your artifact and Elemental Root to a single charge ability.</p><br><p>"Something like a devastating explosion, a lightning punch with electrical discharges, or a thunderous blast from the sky, but with extra pressure. I'm sure your mind will find a way."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply but made no move to respond.</p><br><p>Moira and Lone Blaze glanced over, deep inside, they hoped they could help Adam with their advice.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Evolution Tree's energy came to an end. The Horn of Fallen Thunder and the Gravitational Elemental Root tore from their spots like hounds.</p><br><p>In a bright flash, the two forces crashed into each other.</p><br><p>Suddenly, like a ghost, Adam appeared between them, one hand clutching the artifact tightly and the other grasping the tip of the Elemental Root.</p><br><p>There was a crackling sound.</p><br><p>The third lesser gates shattered with the orb, part of the Stellar Flow rushing forward, quickly reaching the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>Now, Adam had only one second to create a new part of his power.</p><br><br><p>Lone Blaze could see it in his calm, deep gaze. He had made his decision even before their advice.</p><br><p>"I need everything and nothing at once..." he whispered.</p><br><br><p>The Inferno Serpent's eyes narrowed, wanting to see Adam's death.</p><br><p>In a bright flash, Adam disappeared, finding himself a few meters away from a devastating fiery explosion.</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" the Inferno Serpent muttered in disbelief.</p><br><p>Nothing seemed to have changed about Adam, except for one detail.</p><br><p>On his head was a black wreath, ready to be filled with power to give Adam what he needed.</p>
