            <br><p>"Well, well, well..." Adam muttered sitting at the same table along with Silvana and Aton, he was across from Matra who half asleep was at the side.</p><br><p>For several hours, Silvana and Aton had been arguing. They may not have noticed it, but to Adam who was an onlooker from the sidelines, it was obvious.</p><br><p>"Damn... Those two are talking about completely different things. Silvana is making arguments and facts while her father cares about her legacy and her future... The chances of them understanding each other are just not there."</p><br><br><p>In a fit of anger, Aton's fists collapsed on the table, plates shook and bottles were ready to fall at any moment.</p><br><p>"Enough! I've already told you everything! Pick any profession you're interested in where you can work for yourself or have your own business! It doesn't have to be related to Dead Lands!"</p><br><p>Despite the long argument, Silvana's flame in her eyes was still not extinguished, she was ready to fight to the last.</p><br><p>"It's not dangerous at all! I'll always be in the Citadel! And... What's wrong with me helping the Phantom? If it helps save Phantoms' lives and kill a little more monsters, then I'm willing to be the most obedient Operator in the world!"</p><br><p>Hearing Silvana's last words, Aton's face twisted, his veins puffed up and his eyes bloodshot with anger, but... he soon calmed down abruptly.</p><br><br><p>Standing up slowly from the table, Aton walked over to the cabinet, pulled out a bottle of whiskey, and poured it straight into a cup as if it were tea rather than a hard drink.</p><br><br><p>Emptying the cup in a few gulps, Aton wiped his mouth and returned to the table.</p><br><p>He ran a hand through his blonde hair, looking down not wanting to meet Silvana's gaze.</p><br><p>"This is my final decision. If you need money for some institute or even to start your own business in a few years, your mother and I will do our best to help you."</p><br><p>Then, his gaze slowly lifted meeting Silvana's pale face.</p><br><p>"But... Anything related to the Dead Lands is out of the question. Especially about the Operators. You're a smart and capable girl with decent resources behind you. You'll achieve a lot at the Citadel, I'm sure of it."</p><br><p>Without waiting for Silvana's response, Aton left the room. Silvana turned to Matra, hoping for her help, but her dark gaze showed that even she was unable to change Aton's mind.</p><br><br><p>Adam grumbled, rubbing his chin.</p><br><p>"Not the most pleasant situation, but it seems... Silvana has found a way out. Could she change her father's mind?"</p><br><p>His gaze shifted to Silvana.</p><br><p>"It doesn't look like it..."</p><br><br><p>The next day Aton and Silvana did not speak. They crossed paths in the hallways of the house, but they didn't even look at each other, the coldness sensed between them.</p><br><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p><br><p>In the evening, several light knocks sounded at Silvana's door. She didn't know if it was her father or her mother, but she was going to answer it either way. She saw no point in avoiding the conversation.</p><br><p>Opening the door, Silvana saw Matra, a kind smile visible on her mother's face.</p><br><p>"Hi... Am I interrupting you?"</p><br><br><p>A few minutes later, Silvana and Matra were sitting on the bed. Matra was the first to break the awkward silence:</p><br><p>"Silvana... I'll be honest with you. Your father probably won't change his mind."</p><br><p>Despite trying to remain confident, this snapped Silvana, her lips quivered and sadness showed deep in her green eyes.</p><br><p>"However!" Matra exclaimed sharply trying to cheer Silvana up, "I don't think so!"</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes slowly grew wider, looking at Matra hopefully.</p><br><p>"Look, even though your father refused you financial aid about Operator Academy, but your mom is capable of something too!" Your next chapter is on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Wait... You're talking about..."</p><br><p>Crossing her arms over her chest, Matra nodded approvingly.</p><br><p>"Yes, I did some research and did some math... All in all, my personal savings are enough to pay for the first year of education."</p><br><p>A joyful expression reflected on Silvana's face, but no sooner had she enjoyed the happiness than she shook her head with a bitter smile.</p><br><p>"Is something wrong...?" Matra said worriedly.</p><br><p>"I'm grateful to you really, but even if we pay the tuition for the first year, what's next? You won't be able to save up the right amount of money in one year for the next one..."</p><br><p>"But... What about the budget seats? I mean, don't they need smart students like you?"</p><br><p>In response, Silvana only shook her head sadly.</p><br><p>"Mom, it's an Academy, not an institute. They don't look for the best, as there will be enough who pass the exam perfectly. I'm not sure if they even have discounts..."</p><br><br><p>Matra didn't know what to answer. Up until this point, she knew about Dead Lands no more than anyone else. In technical and financial points about the Academies, Silvana knew much more than her.</p><br><p>Moreover, Matra had no relatives or acquaintances of Phantoms or high-ranking military officers, only such people could somehow change Silvana's situation.</p><br><p>And she realized that too.</p><br><p>"Wait... Mom, I think I can find a solution. Can you put aside the right amount of money, just in case?"</p><br><p>The fire in Silvana's eyes left Matra no choice but to nod silently. She wasn't for or against Aton's stance, but she simply couldn't help but want to give her daughter a chance.</p><br><br><p>The next day, when Ceska and Evor came to the restaurant again, Silvana quickly ran up to them and bowed low.</p><br><p>"Please, I need your favor..."</p><br><p>Evor and Ceska looked at each other, they realized that if Silvana decided to approach them, she had no other choice.</p><br><p>"Mhm. Silvana... What exactly do you need? Speak up, hopefully we can help you." Ceska said uncertainly.</p><br><p>Without rising, Silvana looked at Ceska and Evor, a look of determination in her eyes.</p><br><p>"Help me get into Operator Academy. Please, I need an option. Loan me money or use your connections... in exchange, I'll do whatever it takes to pay off the debt."</p><br><p>"Well..." Ceska gulped, feeling awkward because of how determined Silvana was, "I think there is one option."</p><br><br><p>A week later, Silvana was sitting in the military department, waiting to meet with one person. She sat quietly next to the door, intending to wait as long as necessary.</p><br><br><p>Soon, heavy footsteps sounded from far down the corridor and Silvana saw a tall middle-aged man with a strong build and broad shoulders.</p><br><p>"Girl, are you expecting someone? You're not supposed to be here..." The man smiled, scratching the back of his head with one hand, a cup of coffee in his left one.</p><br><p>Silvana simply pointed to the sign, to the name of the person whose office this was.</p><br><p>"Douglas..." The man muttered as his eyes went wide.</p><br><p>Then, he poked himself in the chest with a wide grin.</p><br>
