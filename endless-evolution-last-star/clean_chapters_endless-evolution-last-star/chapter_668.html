            <br><p>Adam and Silvana disappeared around the corner, vanishing into an empty part of the Citadel city. Besides the Iron Observatory, there was nothing of note, just quiet concrete buildings.</p><br><p>Abruptly turning around, not wanting to look their way, Katrin clenched her fists tightly, her teeth grinding not from anger but from a sense of failure.</p><br><p>"Shit... He helped me get rid of that feeling, but he made me remember it again."</p><br><p>Alan raised his eyes looking at Katrin before walking over to her and hugging her from behind. His head rested against her back, rubbing lightly against it.</p><br><p>"Agh!" Katrin gasped as she turned around.</p><br><p>She met the easy gaze with a kind smile from her Operator - a unique tool that always put her at peace.</p><br><p>"You know what he was talking about... don't you?" Katrin muttered in a low voice.</p><br><p>In response, Alan nodded silently, lowering his eyes downward.</p><br><p>That day, Katrin not only went through Gene Diffusion with Alan, with her Operator but also learned about what was happening on one of the Citadel's tops - at the ninth wing, hosted The Rule of Power at the Moon Colosseum, one of the two special arenas.</p><br><br><p>The door opened letting out waves of hot steam. Katrin was wearing nothing but the beige towel she'd used to wipe her wet hair, a few droplets escaping from the tips of her hair as they crashed to the floor.</p><br><p>Outside the window, the light of the sun was long gone, only the glare of passing cars and the quiet glow of the nightlights.</p><br><p>The far door in her house was closed, with the occasional light blue glow coming out - it was Alan's room. Unlike Adam and Silvana, Katrin had lived with her Operator for a long time, it was a popular practice for high-level Phantoms, for many different reasons.</p><br><p>They had successfully undergone the Gene Diffusion and the day was coming to an end, but now when Katrin was alone and the cold air was blowing over her hot skin, her thoughts went to what Alan told her following her question.</p><br><br><p>Making herself a black bitter coffee and pulling out her phone, Katrin stared at the screen like a bewitched person with a deep gaze.</p><br><p>Upon returning home, when the joy of the aftermath of the Gene Diffusion was over, Katrin made Alan tell him everything he could find out about Adam's actions over the past three months.</p><br><p>The Rule of Power couldn't hide from their search.</p><br><p>"High nobles, several heads of the Twelve Branches, and special invitations for guests only available to a select few... stakes totaling more than ten billion..."</p><br><p>Katrin continued to mutter to herself as she looked at the footage of the battle, at the spectators, at the special boxes for the high nobles, and at the level of people most of whom she didn't know and had never heard of.</p><br><p>And, it wasn't that these people were unimportant individuals or lacked influence, on the contrary - the difference in status between them and Katrin was so great that they simply had no points of contact.</p><br><p>Just as the rich didn't meet the poor because they lived in different places, the strong didn't meet the weak.</p><br><p>However... there were always exceptions and in this case it was Fromund and Adam who were the ones.</p><br><p>Katrin's mind was in turmoil, it didn't know what emotion to feel - Anger? Envy? Disappointment?</p><br><p>Inside her, a mixture of different quite unlike emotions was silently boiling up inside her.</p><br><p>"Fuck... This fight... This power..."</p><br><p>Katrin bit her lip, watching the last stage of the fight - when Adam used his Power Gene.</p><br><p>"It's incredible, not only Adam but this guy... Fromund Aegler... he's the same. In fact, he practically won. And... Osana, that bitch."</p><br><p>Her eyes swept over to Osana, who was watching the fight that day with a worried expression.</p><br><p>"Turns out she's no ordinary Phantom at all. Agh..."</p><br><p>For a long time with a dark look Katrin stared at her phone, her coffee had long ago gone cold, she hadn't taken a single sip.</p><br><p>"I want... I want to be in the place of one of them for once... Why are they there and I'm spending my time dealing with ordinary monsters?"</p><br><p>Her voice came from the deepest depths, her desire was sincere but unattainable.</p><br><p>Then, Adam's words rang through Katrin's mind as her eyes went wide with realization.</p><br><p>"Right... That's the thing, though my powers and my Phantom essence have changed, but I haven't... I'm doing the same things I was doing before." Katrin gulped.</p><br><p>"I go on missions, completing one after another, but... even a hundred of those missions, no... even a thousand don't matter compared to a fight against the Plague Reaper or Adam's duel at the Moon Colosseum."</p><br><p>She looked up, remembering Adam's question.</p><br><p>"He asked me about a worthy fight, but... I didn't have the nerve to call the First Wall fight because it wasn't as meaningful as the one against the Plague Reaper."</p><br><p>Katrin's lips quivered and her eyes filled with meaning:</p><br><p>"The Two Walls are created based on the path you've gone through. So, my own decisions and actions have resulted in mine the First Wall not giving me a decent fight. Fuck... I urgently need to fix that."</p><br><p>Then, the corners of her lips went up in a bitter smile. Your next chapter is on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Hah, I'm sure Adam's the First Wall is going to be fucking hell... I wonder what his First Wall looks like? It must be something frightening..."</p><br><br><p>The door opened as Alan walked into the kitchen with a large cup in his hand, his sweet coffee was out and he urgently needed to refill.</p><br><p>"Something on your mind?" Alan raised an eyebrow heading towards their massive coffee machine, clearly very expensive.</p><br><p>Katrin nodded slowly. She watched as Alan made himself coffee and when their gazes met she smiled weakly.</p><br><p>"Hey Alan, I want to go on a mission."</p><br><p>"Sure." Alan quickly replied, "Gathering resources? Killing monsters? Cleaning out the nest? Lately, the military has been reporting that there are too many common monsters in many regions."</p><br><p>However, this time Katrin shook her head, brushing all of his suggestions aside.</p><br><p>"Nah. I want something special this time."</p><br><p>Katrin tapped the table slowly, her eyes deep.</p><br><p>"Find me a mission so difficult and dangerous that you'll be sure I fail. That will be my choice."</p>
