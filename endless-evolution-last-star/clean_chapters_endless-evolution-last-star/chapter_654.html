            <br><p>The Obsidian Spiders were doing their work, none of them had yet noticed the three Phantoms lurking behind the walls of the narrow passageway.</p><br><p>Abel glanced at Silvana and Talna.</p><br><p>Continue your saga on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"What are we going to do...? I can try to immobilize them like I did with the lizards before the entrance. I'm not sure I can hit every one of them, but that way we can deal with most of the spiders."</p><br><p>His plan was simple and effective. Silvana was willing to agree, as she didn't consider Obsidian Spiders to be serious opponents, at least the non-Elite ones.</p><br><p>Seeing that Silvana and Abel were about to spring into action, Talna waved her hand.</p><br><p>"Wait. There's no point in taking any chances. We certainly can't see all the spiders, surely many are just sitting and waiting in the far parts of the cave or even on the ceiling where we can't see them, engulfed in darkness."</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes. Since the beginning of their mission, this was the first time Talna did anything other than tease Silvana.</p><br><p>"What do you suggest?"</p><br><p>Talna grinned widely glaring at Abel and raising her right hand, a silver cross dangling from her wrist.</p><br><p>"We'll take some risks, or rather Abel will, but... we'll end up with the highest score and end up with the second level!"</p><br><br><p>After a few minutes, Abel stepped forward. Oddly enough, he stopped his hammer behind him, the massive weapon lying against the wall with the hilt up.</p><br><p>He held his shield of golden energy with both hands, slowly moving forward. They discussed the plan, each knew what they were going to do, but he was still nervous.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the Obsidian Spiders paid no attention to Abel, or rather they weren't going to fight him.</p><br><p>A multitude of violet eyes watched him from the darkness, not only noticing his moving silhouette but also the bright glow from his shield, yet most of the Obsidian Spiders continued to do their work, tending to the eggs and breaking the energy crystals into small pieces.</p><br><p>Thus, Abel was under constant surveillance, but as long as he didn't show aggression, the spiders wouldn't touch him.</p><br><p>It wasn't just the behavior of the Obsidian Spiders, but also the fact that they were in the wrong place to fight.</p><br><p>The Obsidian Spiders realized that if they attacked Abel now, even if they killed him quickly, some of their eggs, their offspring, would be harmed.</p><br><p>This was a risk that the Obsidian Spiders could not take.</p><br><p>In that case, it seemed that Silvana, Abel, and Talna could just quietly pass by to avoid wasting much time on the second floor, but they were Phantoms, they had a primary mission, but they couldn't just let hundreds of strong monsters pass by.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes narrowed intently, staring at the purple eggs, soon she heard Adam's voice.</p><br><p>'It's kind of hard to recognize, but given the size of the eggs and the size of the adults of the Obsidian Spiders, I'm sure there are dozens or even hundreds of smaller eggs in each one.'</p><br><p>"Yeah, I was thinking about that too. That's why we're not going to leave any alive. When we come out of these caves, there won't be a single living monster here."</p><br><p>'Good, and... Silvana.' Adam said slowly, 'I advise you to ignore Talna, I'm sure she will continue to do so regardless of what has happened.'</p><br><p>Silvana didn't answer anything this time, she only gripped the hilts of her blades tighter.</p><br><br><p>Abel stopped in the center of the cave. A lot of spiders ran by his side, they hissed irritatedly at him, not because he was a Phantom, but because he prevented them from walking and they had to change their direction.</p><br><p>"Alright, it's time for action." Abel gulped before taking a deep breath.</p><br><p>His eyes shone brightly as the energy traveled through his entire body. In a few moments, his calm energy turned aggressive and violent like the evil sun.</p><br><p>A golden layer quickly covered his body, coming out in long sparse spikes as sharp as thorns.</p><br><p>Abel pressed the shield tightly against his chest so that there were no gaps between him and it narrowed his shoulders, tucked his knees, and tilted his torso slightly forward.</p><br><p>At the same moment, all Obsidian Spiders stopped. The hundreds of tiny hairs on their legs quivered, sensing the unpleasant energy emanating from Abel.</p><br><p>As if unwilling to obey their inner instincts, the Obsidian Spiders turned around, staring at Abel as the only important target in their lives. The spiders that were hiding in the shadows or on the ceiling, climbed down revealing their silhouettes.</p><br><p>Gradually the whole space was occupied by the Obsidian Spiders, from time to time they moved from side to side like a wave, gradually approaching Abel.</p><br><p>Talna watching him from afar smirked contentedly.</p><br><p>"Good, his ability makes them feel aggressive towards him and want to attack him. However, they're still fighting back, but... soon they'll be in a real rage."</p><br><p>Usually, Abel used this ability to attract the attention of monsters so that his allies could prepare a trap or save his allies. However, it was also a great way to attract all the monsters in one place even those that preferred to hide their presence.</p><br><p>"Gha..." Abel took a deep breath, ignoring the fact that some spiders were already only a few meters away from him.</p><br><p>Their jaws were closing with a distinct snap, and their front legs were raised high in a threatening way.</p><br><p>For a moment, Abel's eyes grew darker.</p><br><p>"Damn... I even kind of feel sorry for you. I wouldn't want someone to do something like that to me..." Abel muttered before turning around and stepping forward.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, red flames came out of his body like an explosion, giving Abel not only an intimidating speed, but also momentum, for just one stride, yet it was more than enough for his purpose.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Dashing like a fiery projectile, holding his shield in front of him, Abel crashed into one cocoon after another, shattering hundreds of eggs into tiny fragments under the many eyes of their caring parents.</p><br><p>A sly grin covered Talna's face.</p><br><p>"Hehehe... They won't rest until they've ripped Abel to shreds, but soon they'll follow their spawn!"</p>
