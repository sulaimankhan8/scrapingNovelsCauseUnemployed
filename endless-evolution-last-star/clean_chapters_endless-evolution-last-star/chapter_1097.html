            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1097: Tailor’s Assistant (Part 2)</strong></p><br><br><p>The crimson burst came out one last time as the blades cut the Frozen Krugo’s massive head into several pieces. The massive beast was defeated, though it wasn’t nearly as easy as Adam expected.</p><br><p>“Agh… Agh… Agh…” Adam collapsed to the ground as he breathed heavily.</p><br><p>If necessary, he could continue fighting, but it wouldn’t be easy at all. In total, it took him three strikes to defeat the Frozen Krugo with his Nexus.</p><br><p>‘Damn. I can feel the recoil coursing through my entire body. Is this all because I’m using one ring?’ Adam complained inwardly. ‘What will happen when I activate all five?!’</p><br><p>Sure, Adam wasn’t going to do anything that stupid. He knew his body couldn’t take it, and before he could even land a single attack, he would simply pass out, using up all his power.</p><br><br><p>Slowly, Adam got up, looking at the Frozen Krugo. The conversation between Silvana and Wilfred remained a secret to Adam because at that moment, he was focused on his battle.</p><br><p>Traces of sharp claws covered the ground around him, ice crystals were shattered into fragments, and the snow around him was stained with blood.</p><br><p>In addition to the recoil, Adam missed two strikes from the Frozen Krugo. The monster did not possess any special abilities, but its physical strength was enough to injure Adam even through his block.</p><br><br><p>Light footsteps sounded from the side as Silvana approached Adam.</p><br><p>She was about to say something when a shadow fell over Adam, causing Silvana’s eyes to widen in fear.</p><br><p>The huge bat, sensing that this was its chance, attacked Adam.</p><br><p>“Fuck!” Adam shouted as he tried to dodge.</p><br><br><p>Thanks to his reaction, he managed to do so at the very last moment, but the bat’s claw still dug deep into his shoulder, its blade cutting through his flesh and bone.</p><br><p>Adam’s pupils trembled in wild pain as his veins swelled, but he did not scream. His eyes locked on the fleeing monster, which would surely want to attack again.</p><br><p>Adam had to be ready, he understood that.</p><br><p>But everyone forgot that besides Adam and Silvana, there was another human here. At least that was a big mistake on the part of the ice bat.</p><br><p>Without taking his eyes off his cigarette, Wilfred stretched out his left arm. His finger followed the bat like a sniper taking his time to aim.</p><br><p>Then, a surge of green energy ran through his arm, bursting out in a high-speed projectile that flew through the ice caves at the speed of sound.</p><br><br><p>Before the monster could comprehend what was happening, the projectile tore the bat to pieces. The destructive explosion destroyed the monster, leaving only two massive wings flying off to the side and falling to the ground.</p><br><p>Wilfred did not even look in the direction of the bat. In this world, there was no F1 Black Threat Monster that could withstand his attack.</p><br><br><p>Taking out his last cigarette, Wilfred headed toward Adam and Silvana.</p><br><p>“Let’s go. This is my last one. We need to get back to the Lower Ring ASAP. There’s nowhere to buy cigarettes here, you know?” Wilfred said emotionlessly, even though blood was pouring from Adam’s shoulder from his deep wound.</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly. “Tsk. You know smoking is bad for you, right?”</p><br><p>“Yeah, but it’s better to smoke a thousand cigarettes than to get a wound like yours. Besides, it doesn’t seem to bother you much, as I can see.”</p><br><p>Wilfred exhaled a cloud of smoke as he moved forward. Adam was about to follow him, as he understood that Wilfred was right. They needed to return to the Lower Ring. That was their goal.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana exclaimed, causing the two men to stop.</p><br><p>Wilfred glanced at her over his shoulder. “What is it this time?”</p><br><p>“Give me a minute and I’ll fix everything! Then… we’ll quickly return to the Lower Ring!”</p><br><p>Wilfred’s eyes dropped to his cigarette, then he nodded.</p><br><p>“Fine, show us what you can do.”</p><br><p>Adam turned his head from side to side in confusion. He didn’t understand what the two were talking about.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam felt his Evolution Tree tremble. Then, Silvana’s eyes lit up as streams of white energy swirled around her. The energy emanated directly from the Evolution Tree while pulsations ran through the Evolution Vein.</p><br><p>After all, their energy was now connected. After Adam’s evolution to the K4-Level, she could use it for more than just basic body enhancement.</p><br><p>Adam blinked as a white outfit covered Silvana’s frame, somewhat resembling a tailor’s assistant’s clothing. The outfit did not attempt to restrict her movements, but was her work uniform, a loose coat and pants.</p><br><p>But this quickly ceased to be surprising to Adam when he saw something else.</p><br><p>A single needle appeared between Silvana’s fingers in her right hand, and long rods with silver threads resembling yarns on her forearm.</p><br><p>Such attire and tools were only suitable for one job — sewing fabric, joining two torn or cut pieces together.</p><br><p>That was exactly what she was going to do with Adam.</p><br><br><p>Silvana approached Adam as her smirk quickly disappeared, replaced by a serious, professional look.</p><br><p>“To be honest, I wanted to do this another time so we would have more than a minute, but…” Her eyes fell on Adam’s cut. “I can’t let you go with a wound like that and suffer when I can easily fix it!”</p><br><p>Adam gulped. He couldn’t believe his eyes.</p><br><p>True, he had assumed that Silvana would eventually develop her own ability, something separate that she could use for herself, just as Julia had done during his and Reinz’s training at Erik’s mansion.</p><br><br><p>‘Holy… she looks beautiful.’</p><br><p>Adam thought as Silvana’s hand moved.</p><br><p>Before he could comprehend it, a silver needle pierced his cut shoulder several times, sewing the cut with strong silver threads to connect the two bloody edges.</p><br><p>Her energy actively influenced Adam’s body, removing traces of blood and increasing his regeneration several times over in the area where the threads passed.</p><br><p>Wilfred, watching from the sidelines, nodded slightly.</p><br><p>‘Well, that minute was worth it. Too bad there are no more cigarettes.’</p>
