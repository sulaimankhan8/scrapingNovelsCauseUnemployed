            <br><p>As if caught under a powerful spell and turned to stone, Fromund stared at the crimson coin for a long time - at the blue screen with a long string of digits that were just one number.</p><br><br><p>From time to time, Erik drank his very strong tea in slow, short sips. He had nowhere to rush so he didn't rush Fromund who couldn't believe his eyes.</p><br><p>"Wait... If by betting 300 million you made 450, then..."</p><br><p>Fromund's eyes went wide, then his expression abruptly changed to an annoyed frown.</p><br><p>"You bet on Adam's victory! You figured I'd lose even though most people bet on me winning and... you were right!"</p><br><p>Unable to contain his emotions, Fromund brought his fist down on the table, shaking the dishes and the tower of cardboard pizza boxes.</p><br><p>Expecting something similar, Erik only shrugged before setting his tea aside.</p><br><p>Fromund bit his lip, his gaze lowered to the ground.</p><br><p>"Answer me honestly, did you know I was going to lose from the start? Was there some obvious difference between me and Adam that only someone as powerful and influential as you could spot?"</p><br><p>Deep down he hoped Erik would say it was simple luck or coincidence, but... he was long past the age of a child to believe that.</p><br><p>Erik smiled bitterly, shrugging his shoulders.</p><br><p>"I don't want to upset you, nor do I want to deceive you. I calculated my chances of winning as 85/15 or 90/10. That is, I realized that there was a small chance that I was wrong and my 300 million would just burn up. However, it's over now and we both know the outcome."</p><br><p>"About your question about the difference between you two..."</p><br><p>Looking away and scratching the back of his head, Erik sighed heavily:</p><br><p>"You would've won with at least a 95% chance if you were like Adam. I mean, let's be honest. Even though his abilities are much better suited for a duel while yours are designed to take out masses of opponents, you almost won."</p><br><p>Fromund bit his lip as his face grew darker, he knew what Erik was talking about since he thought about it during the fight and today and would probably think about it for a long time to come.</p><br><p>"I'm sure you don't understand exactly what caused you to lose either, though you're definitely the more experienced and dangerous as a K2-Phantom."</p><br><p>Then, Erik's crimson eyes grew deeper, like bloody rubies.</p><br><p>"And... that's exactly the difference between the two of you. You're an overly experienced K2-Phantom. Because of the fear of dying in the destruction of the First Wall, you haven't dared to do it for a long time. I understand what you're thinking since your death would mean the end not only for you but also for your little sisters."</p><br><p>"You're not moving forward, while Adam waited for this moment. He wanted to get stronger and that desire drove him to victory."</p><br><p>Keeping his stern, dark gaze, Erik continued:</p><br><p>"Eilva, Liv, and Tilda... all of them will not survive without your protection and help. I realize that and especially you."</p><br><p>Clenching his fists tightly and biting his lip almost to the point of bleeding, Fromund frowned heavily:</p><br><p>"And? Why are you telling me all this? I know it without you. I want to become stronger like any Phantom, I want to destroy the First Wall and reach W1, but... I have obligations!"</p><br><p>Seeing that Fromund was at his limit, Erik nodded deeply and leaned back in his chair.</p><br><p>As if not feeling the tension of the situation he created himself, he serenely opened one of the boxes and tore off a large slice of pizza.</p><br><p>The cheese had almost solidified and looked more like a thick layer of rubbery mass, but the cold pizza was still pizza, delicious with a crispy crust.</p><br><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch. Read exclusive content at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Taking a few bites, Erik looked at Fromund who was confused by his actions.</p><br><p>"Don't think about it too much, as you finally have the opportunity to change your situation - I'm going to give you the chance to forget fear and take a risk on the path to power."</p><br><p>Fromund's mouth opened wide, he wanted to say something, but... before the first words could escape his lips, somehow a slice of pizza with rich meat toppings ended up in his mouth.</p><br><p>"But, let's not rush things. First I want you to realize that I didn't bring this thing here to show off." Erik pointed to the crimson coin, the blue screen flashing occasionally.</p><br><p>"This money. I'm giving 450 million to you. There's a chip inside. All you have to do is attach this device to your NEP and the money will immediately go into your account. This isn't some kind of condition or ultimatum, but if you do this then I'll be sure of your intentions."</p><br><p>Putting everything aside, Erik leaned forward.</p><br><p>"However, I know that even this much money won't be enough to pay your debt to the people from the Lower Ring. I'm not going to pay the rest of your debt. You will do it yourself, and you can do it much faster when you get stronger."</p><br><p>Confusion and surprise were reflected on Fromund's face. He slowly tore a slice off the pizza and set it aside.</p><br><p>"I don't know what you want, but... it doesn't matter how much money you give me. As long as there's a debt I won't risk my life and go into the Dead Lands to destroy the First Wall."</p><br><p>Erik nodded deeply, holding his hands in front of him in a lock.</p><br><p>"I know. But, this isn't about debt, it's about your duties to your little sisters. So I suggest to you that all of them, excluding you, come under the patronage of the Wurhen Family."</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Fromund's eyes went wide with disbelief looking at the calm, confident in his every word Erik.</p><br><p>"What...? What did you just say?"</p><br><p>Erik sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"Your ears don't deceive you. I'm not going to adopt Elva, Liv, and Tilda, their last name will remain Aegler, just like yours. However, no one else will dare to harm them in the event of your death and they will be educated and can study for any profession they want. Be it military, doctor, artist, actor, or Operator."</p><br><p>Fromund shuddered, he hadn't counted on such an offer and didn't know how good or bad it was, but... he knew that everything had its price.</p><br><p>"And..." Fromund muttered, "What do you want in return? I'm a simple K2-Phantom, compared to you I'm just dust. What do I have to offer you to release me from my fear, from my chains so I can move on with my path..."</p><br><p>In response, Erik only smiled widely and sat back in his chair more comfortably.</p><br><p>"Well, don't worry, it will be easy since you already have experience in this matter."</p>
