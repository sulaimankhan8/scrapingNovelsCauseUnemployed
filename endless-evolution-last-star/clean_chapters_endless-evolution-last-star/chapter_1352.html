            <h4>Chapter 1352: Whose servant are you?</h4><br><p>While Adam was off to take the second trial, some changes occurred at Forgotten Mills, albeit minor ones.
</p><br><p>Nollura stared intently at the Silver Beacon, whose top suddenly shone brightly. It wasn’t a crystal light, which would mean that Adam had passed all the trials, but it wasn’t black either, which would mean his death.
</p><br><br><p>Norax glanced to the side as a smirk appeared on his face.
</p><br><p>"Oh, it means Adam has passed the first trial. He did well, he got through it pretty quickly."
</p><br><p>Narica sighed with relief, but quickly regained her serious expression as she stood next to Norax.
</p><br><p>"Hahaha! I knew this kiddo would make it!" Karso laughed, banging his fist on the table.
</p><br><p>Only Misty was in no hurry to show her joy. She frowned slightly, staring intently in the western direction, into the distant darkness.
</p><br><p>"That doesn’t mean anything yet. How many contenders passed the first trial? Then, just a few minutes later, we saw the black light. Bertrada, the Silver Beacon, she doesn’t like to lose, so what she wants is to enjoy the show and end it quickly."
</p><br><p>It seemed that Misty was overly pessimistic, Nollura thought, but seeing Karso’s serious look and Norax’s reaction, she realized that such a scenario was quite possible.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, she often did that trick. I don’t blame her for it. I mean, if I were in her place, I would do the same. That way, she can enjoy a rare show and not give away the prize she should, because a contender will fail at the very end."
</p><br><p>This had happened many times before, but from time to time, the Silver Beacon couldn’t do it because she couldn’t go against the rules. However, almost always, the rules and trials themselves were so difficult that she didn’t have to do anything except not help a contender.
</p><br><p>"This..." Nollura muttered, with a slight sadness. "Does that mean that with each trial passed, Adam’s chances will become smaller and smaller?"
</p><br><p>Misty was about to respond gently to reassure Nollura, but Norax just shrugged.
</p><br><p>"Pretty much. It may sound pretty bad, but no matter how small his chances are, they will always be greater than zero. Sometimes, that’s all that matters."
</p><br><p>Norax turned toward the White Spire and narrowed his eyes.
</p><br><p>"What’s more, the Silver Beacon often forgets that the rules apply to her as well. She accepted that herself when she came to the White Spire. It’s her choice, and it may be her downfall."
</p><br><br><p>At the same time, unaware of their conversation, Adam descended on the platform with Mona in complete silence.
</p><br><p>The atmosphere lacked the calm melody found in the elevators of luxury hotels.
</p><br><p>"You know what awaits me down there, right?" Adam asked after a while.
</p><br><p>Mona nodded weakly. "Of course. All the trials were prepared and adjusted the moment you chose the amber crystal. As the host of the White Spire, I am obliged to know this to ensure that everything works as it should."
</p><br><p>Adam scratched his cheek thoughtfully.
</p><br><p>"You know, there’s something I don’t understand."
</p><br><p>"Ask away. While I’m here, I’m ready to answer your questions, if it’s within my power, of course."
</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand. "Well, initially, I came to the Silver Beacon, met the guard, defeated him, and then encountered you and chose the amber crystal. However... we’re not at the Silver Beacon now, are we?"
</p><br><p>She gave him a long, intense look with her large, slightly intimidating eyes.
</p><br><p>’How strange. Did he really feel like he was teleported? Even if he is a young Phantom, he has definitely used teleportation several times, both natural and artificial, still... he shouldn’t have noticed anything.’
</p><br><p>"We are where we need to be so that you can pass the trial and earn my mistress’s approval." She replied coldly. "Next question."
</p><br><p>For Adam, that was enough to confirm his theory.
</p><br><p>"Alright, then what is the White Spire? After all, we are here now and not at the Silver Beacon, right?"
</p><br><p>"I already answered that..." Mona tried to say something to distract Adam from the question.
</p><br><p>She didn’t know that, regardless of her answers, he had already figured out a lot.
</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, towering over the petite Mona, forcing her back against the wall.
</p><br><p>"What? Shouldn’t you be stronger than me?" He asked with a stern look. "I don’t like it when people hide the truth from me, Mona. The White Spire is where we are now because I was teleported here from the Silver Beacon."
</p><br><p>Then, he leaned in, his sharp blue eyes dangerously close to her large ones.
</p><br><p>"The Silver Beacon, your mistress. She is here, not in her physical form at the Forgotten Mills, right?"
</p><br><p>Mona gulped, not knowing how to respond. She shouldn’t have been in this position in front of a regular contender.
</p><br><p>"Hah, maybe I was wrong." Adam smiled bitterly. "Calling the Silver Beacon your mistress is a mistake because you originally obeyed the White Spire. Am I right?"
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Mona’s pupils narrowed as she shuddered with fear at the realization that Adam knew too much, much more than he should have.
</p><br><br><p>The platform stopped as a gate appeared in the light, inviting Adam to proceed to the next trial.
</p><br><p>"W-We’ve arrived..." Mona muttered in a trembling voice. "You must pass the second trial, contender. RIGHT NOW!"
</p><br><p>Then, she disappeared into the light, ending up in a part of the White Spire where Adam would not be able to find her.
</p><br><p>"Hah, she ran away?" Adam grinned, looking around. "Anyway, I found out everything I wanted to know. Norax didn’t mention it, just like he didn’t mention the crystals. Maybe he couldn’t. The White Spire and the Silver Beacon seem to be two Ancient Artifacts, but one of them has been empty for a long time..."
</p><br><p>Shaking his head, Adam stepped forward, realizing that he still needed more information to confirm his theory.
</p><br><p>Now, it was time for the next trial, and as soon as he stepped off the platform, a multitude of cannons were aimed at him.
</p><br><p>"Oh... Another hot start?"</p>
