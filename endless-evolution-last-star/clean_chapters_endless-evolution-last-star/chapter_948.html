            <br><p>The defeats had long been Adam's partner and motivation to improve. The quick, almost instantaneous defeat of the Inferno Serpent was no exception to that rule.</p><br><p>Risha couldn't see Adam through the cloud of dust in the distance, but her heart beat faster while sweat ran down her forehead.</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent paid no attention to her, he narrowed his eyes waiting for Adam's next move.</p><br><p>Suddenly, a calm, masculine voice sounded in Risha's head.</p><br><p>'Risha, you need to wait for the right moment and escape. I know this is unacceptable to you, but neither of you stands a chance against the Inferno Serpent,' the Glen's voice trembled. 'I say this as your Operator, as your future partner... That monster is beyond your powers.'</p><br><p>As soon as his words were spoken Risha gulped. In all the time she had been trying to connect with her new Operator, she had never heard Glen sound so desperate.</p><br><p>'What...? No, Glen, it's alright, at least I hope so...' she muttered. 'If my brother sent Adam on a hunt for the S4 Monster, then he's up to the task!'</p><br><p>She bit her lip, her eyes running from the monster to Adam. 'It's clear with me, I don't have a chance against the Inferno Serpent, yet... But, as much as I don't want to admit it - Adam is much stronger than me. I guess it was just a failed attempt, that's all.</p><br><p>Glen's uncertain voice echoed in her head again. 'So... Do you honestly believe that Adam will defeat the Inferno Serpent?'</p><br><br><br><p>Adam waved his hand, tossing the cobblestone aside.</p><br><p>"Tsk, that wasn't cool at all," he grumbled, brushing away a trickle of blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><br><p>'Are you alright?' Silvana asked worriedly.</p><br><p>Adam slowly stood up, shaking the dust off of himself. 'Yeah... Something like that. But, so far I don't see how I can defeat this huge snake. Not that this is the first time, I just don't see any options at all.'</p><br><p>His eyes narrowed, staring at the massive silhouette in the distance. The Inferno Serpent was in no hurry to go anywhere, he remained in the lake, watching Adam curiously with his sly amber eyes.</p><br><p>"I struck at full force, using energy and the Elemental Root. However, all I achieved was one pitiful crack on his countless scales. At this rate, it will take me a hundred years to break through his armor."</p><br><p>The situation was difficult, but Silvana was not about to act pessimistic in front of her Phantom. It was her duty to help him find a path to victory.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Petrification and powerful physical strength didn't work. Let's say the Inferno Serpent has good resistance to the elements, and the scales are a very sturdy defense. In that case, you have two options, either attack him with other abilities or aim for a more vulnerable spot.'</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head. "Well, I'd like to use two options at once. His eyes... They piss me the hell off. Hopefully, he won't mind losing one of them."</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam tore forward while silver threads covered his body, and an amber grid appeared deep in his right eye. He kept a few abilities as a trump card, but a needle appeared in his hand and the Stellar Resonance was activated.</p><br><p>'Fine, let's see how durable he is. First I'll make him think I'm trying to break through his armor. If I use everything I have, I can probably do it.</p><br><p>'Then, when he focuses on defending his broken scales, I'll show him that the S4 monster is not the kind of opponent that can make me afraid, that can plunge me into despair!'</p><br><p>A bitter smile showed on his face.</p><br><p>"I'll leave that honor to someone stronger."</p><br><br><p>In a white flash, Adam found himself facing the Inferno Serpent again. Pulsations ran down his long needle, he was going to use the Infusive Energy Control as well.</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>"How boring... Are you so stupid that you would try to attack in the same place? Only an idiot repeats a mistake twice!"</p><br><p>"No," Adam's cold eyes grew deeper. "That's the problem with all of humanity. We keep repeating our mistakes in hopes that this time something will be different."</p><br><p>A wave of energy traveled down the needle, aiming for wide scales.</p><br><p>"The amazing thing is that sometimes it works. The whole world changes, people adapt, but the essence of humanity is constant."</p><br><br><p>Three pulses moved off the impact point, shattering the scales into small shards. The Inferno Serpent's pupils narrowed, he didn't believe Adam was capable of doing that.</p><br><p>However, it was only a tiny step towards victory. Adam had a marathon ahead of him.</p><br><p>"You..." the Inferno Serpent hissed. "So this needle is where your true power is?"</p><br><p>Adam didn't show it, but he was shocked that one shattered scale and a few cracks on the scales nearby was all he could accomplish.</p><br><p>'Shit, when I used that attack against Reinz, I practically smeared him on the wall in a bloody stain. 'Tsk, that serpent is too big. All the force of my attack just scattered all over his huge body!'</p><br><p>Suddenly, Risha's shout rang out from the side:</p><br><p>"Adam! Look out! From above!"</p><br><br><p>Before he could react, a tail in a whip came crashing down on him, throwing him straight to the bottom of the lava lake.</p><br><p>Risha gasped, her eyes filled with fear.</p><br><p>Sure, normal lava or red-hot metal was useless against a Phantom, especially a K3 one, but the lava lake at the Cave Grid was a different case.</p><br><p>For the Inferno Serpent, it was a warm bath of pleasant temperature, his scales distributing most of the heat, but Adam was small and vulnerable to fire.</p><br><br><p>With an amber splash of red-hot lava, Adam jumped out, streaking along the Inferno Serpent's back.</p><br><p>Drops of lava dripped from his coat, one fell from the ends of his black hair, but the energy flowing throughout his body prevented any burns.</p><br><p>Another batch of scales flew off to the side, then, followed by another sweep of the tail.</p><br><br><p>Risha was frozen in her place as if petrified. She could only watch as the huge serpent repeatedly threw Adam in different directions: into the lake, into the wall, and then tried to grab him and crush him in midair.</p><br><p>However, none of this could stop Adam even for a second. As soon as he plunged into the wall after another hit, he would immediately jump out and attack again.</p><br><p>'Fuck... How does he do that?'</p><br><p>Risha shuddered, her wide-open eyes reflected a white flash, attacking the huge monster in a desperate attempt to make some progress.</p><br><p>'I don't know how strong the serpent's attacks are, but... I couldn't have continued fighting after the first direct hit!'</p><br><p>Risha actually knew the answer.</p><br><p>Adam was moving correctly, defending himself at the last moment and using energy control to minimize the effects of the tail strike. Figuring out what to do wasn't hard, but executing it was a whole other story.</p><br><p>'Good...' Adam muttered internally. 'He's preparing to defend his body, trying to anticipate where I'll attack next. Then it's time to get serious.'</p><br><br><p>Not letting the Inferno Serpent guess his plan, Adam struck again.</p><br><p>"Not this time!" the Inferno Serpent exclaimed, gripping Adam tightly before his needle could reach the target.</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent's eyes narrowed, scrutinizing Adam's expression, wanting to see only fear and panic in it. He tried to hold back, eager to see what else the human in front of him was capable of, but he was tired of repeating the same action.</p><br><p>"You managed to inflict more wounds on me than I expected, but... Now I'll just crush you like a bug!"</p><br><p>With a calm expression, Adam looked at the serpent. "Was I not strong enough for your hidden assignment?"</p><br><p>Confusion was reflected in the Inferno Serpent.</p><br><p>"In that case, I will have to punish you for your arrogance. It's usually humans who suffer from it, but it seems talking monsters are capable of it too."</p><br><p>The flash blinded the Inferno Serpent - he was too late to see the path going from Adam to his right eye.</p><br><p>"NO!!!!" the Inferno Serpent roared, his instincts screaming at him about the impending threat.</p><br><p>In an instant, scarlet streaks of cuts covered the tip of the serpent's tail as Adam dashed forward finding himself behind his enemy.</p><br><p>First impulse. Second impulse. Third impulse.</p><br><p>With a shudder, the amber eye exploded, drenching the majestic creature's head in its blood.</p><br><br><p>The Inferno Serpent's furious roar thundered throughout the Red Zone, shaking the stone peaks and looming stalactites atop.</p><br><br><p>Red energy traveled along the hundreds of scales, empowering him with strength unknown before.</p><br><p>Adam wasn't nervous, he prepared to fight, but before he could realize anything, three fiery flashes rained down on him.</p><br><br><p>Flying a kilometer away, Adam smashed several rocks with his back before finally coming to a stop, lying in a pool of his own blood.</p><br><p>"Fuck... That hurt..." Adam wheezed with difficulty raising his fist. "Maybe try again?"</p><br><p>Then, he remembered that his gravitational punch did not affect the serpent.</p><br><p>'No... It's useless. Shit! What if my remaining trump cards are useless too?'</p><br><p>'That's not an option, to win I need something else...'</p><br><p>'I need a solution to my current problem.'</p><br><p>He clenched his fist tightly, drops of blood falling on his face.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a strange shiver passed through his Evolution Tree, resembling the smirk of a devious old man who finally waited out.</p><br><p>Then, without Adam's knowledge, energy began to condense around his artifact and the Elemental Root, while the third lesser gates started to vigorously rattle.</p>
