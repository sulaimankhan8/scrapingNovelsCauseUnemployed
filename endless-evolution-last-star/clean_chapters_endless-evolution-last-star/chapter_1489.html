            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1489: Two Guests (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Adam’s plan was to complete all his business at the Citadel, speak with Damien or someone who could help him understand how to fulfill the conditions for the Third Grand Star, and then return to the Dead Lands, possibly with Alexia, or perhaps alone, as was usually the case.</p><br><p>Everything was going well, and nothing should have prevented Adam from meeting Damien. After all, they had encountered each other several times, and Damien had helped Adam a lot on his path, whether it was information, motivation, resources, or simple sparring, the results of which Adam still remembered.</p><br><p>Well, Damien had other plans.</p><br><br><p>Powerful gusts of wind fluttered Adam’s hair as he rushed past dozens of floors of the skyscraper. Glass and burning lights turned into a blur as he approached the surface at tremendous speed.</p><br><p>Sure, even a fall from such a height would not be fatal for Adam. His body was too strong, but that wasn’t the point.</p><br><p>“Does he want me to return to the top from this position?” Adam thought as he glanced over his shoulder.</p><br><p>There were still a few seconds left before he reached the ground. Nothing prevented him from slowing down his fall, landing, and going back up with the elevator.</p><br><p>But… unlike ordinary humans for whom the elevator was the only option, he could try something else.</p><br><p>‘Tsk, did it really have to be done this way?’ Adam frowned as his aura grew stronger. ‘What an arrogant bastard!’</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>His energy flowed to his feet as the black-and-white flame turned into two small clouds.</p><br><br><p>Adam continued to fall because he didn’t have enough energy to make the clouds dense enough to allow him to stand in the air.</p><br><p>Still, that wasn’t the limit of what Adam was capable of. He could use his abilities, but he knew that would be unfair.</p><br><p>“Alright, I’ve slowed down by 80% to 90%…” He thought as he looked at the ground, which was now approaching quite slowly. Instead of a few seconds, he had almost a minute.</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly.</p><br><p>‘Alright, so all I need to do is compress my energy even more, right? After I created the Second Grand Star and revealed the next star, I became stronger. I’ve already fully recovered from the battle against Menax, I should be able to do it this time!’</p><br><p>He remembered how Erik, Saegar, Damien, Kenward, and other Second Circle creatures did it, especially Erik when he came to confirm the results of his battle against Reinz at the Alderran Family territory.</p><br><p>Erik simply walked through the air, creating an invisible platform from his energy with each step. Still, even that was not the limit of his abilities. At will, he could make the space beneath him denser, thus preventing himself from falling.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Adam clenched his fists tightly as his veins bulged. It was difficult for him to do this in pure form, without abilities, but he was gradually getting the hang of it.</p><br><p>Around the time he reached the twentieth floor, he stopped falling as two energy disks under his soles were only slightly larger than his boots, allowing him to stand confidently in the air.</p><br><p>“Agh… Agh… Agh…” Adam breathed heavily as he glanced to the side.</p><br><p>A little girl standing by the window looked at him with wide eyes. Next to her was her mother, whose expression was no less surprised.</p><br><br><p>The girl took a bite of her cookie as sparks appeared in her eyes. She couldn’t believe what she was seeing.</p><br><p>“Hah, I’ll take that look as my reward.” Adam smiled as he looked up. “Alright, it’s time to go back!”</p><br><br><p>With each jump, Adam climbed higher, one floor at a time. He had fallen from the top of a skyscraper, so he had to go a long way before he could see the edge of his balcony.</p><br><p>“Good…” Adam’s hoarse voice rang out as he wiped the sweat from his forehead. “Agh, what the hell am I doing? This is not how tonight was supposed to go.”</p><br><p>He looked up, ready to finish his journey. He had a few more jumps to go.</p><br><p>Suddenly, shock covered his face as Alexia’s silhouette reflected in his eyes. She flew off the balcony just like he did a few minutes ago.</p><br><br><p>Alexia flew past him, her gaze both puzzled and aware of what was happening.</p><br><p>When she reached about the fiftieth floor, her patience ran out.</p><br><br><p>Then, the temperature dropped sharply as Alexia hurried back.</p><br><p>Adam shook his head and jumped onto his balcony only to see Damien standing by the wall with his arms crossed over his chest. Beth had already gone inside. She didn’t want to take part in this.</p><br><p>“What was that?” Adam raised an eyebrow. He was clearly unhappy.</p><br><br><p>“How about we call it unscheduled practice?”</p><br><p>His gaze shifted to Adam’s feet.</p><br><p>“As I see it, you did it. This is your first time ‘flying’ using only your pure energy, right?” Damien smirked, knowing what the answer would be.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam couldn’t deny his words. He had actually managed to climb to the top of the skyscraper through the sky.</p><br><p>Sure, it was difficult to call it a full-fledged flight, but considering that Adam wasn’t in the heat of battle and was using only his energy, it was a decent result.</p><br><p>“Yeah, you’re right,” Adam scratched the back of his head.</p><br><p>“But I could have done it without your help.”</p><br><p>“Hahaha, come on. Do you think I often get the chance to have so much fun? I just took advantage of the opportunity, nothing else.”</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>“Actually, I think you do something like this all the time. Maybe not with me, but with someone else.”</p><br><p>Adam didn’t even know how right he was. If Frida were here, she would have something to say.</p><br><br><p>With a rush of cold wind, Alexia appeared behind them as she landed next to Adam.</p><br><p>“You…” She glared at Damien. “What the hell are you doing?”</p><br><br><p>Damien stepped forward and, like a ghost, appeared in front of Alexia in the next moment.</p><br><br><p>He flicked her forehead as she fell to the ground.</p><br><p>“Ouch! Bastard!” Alexia exclaimed, clutching her forehead.</p><br><p>Then, Damien smiled and looked at them.</p><br><p>“The Third Grand Star, right?”</p><br><p>They nodded simultaneously.</p><br><p>“Good. You’ll definitely need some help and advice. But!”</p><br><br><p>“First, I want snacks!”</p>
