            <br><p>Evil and good have always been opposites, two sides fighting each other, but... was it like that in the real, gray world?</p><br><p>"What...? Do you like good people?" Zarot asked.</p><br><p>He wasn't ready to believe what he was hearing since Gladius was one of the most violent, amoral, and bloodthirsty people he knew.</p><br><p>However, this was no joke.</p><br><p>The calm blue eyes showed that Gladius was completely serious and it greatly disturbed Zarot.</p><br><p>"Well, it looks like you're too stupid to understand what I'm talking about, but that's no problem. I can explain it all to you."</p><br><p>Then, Gladius smiled broadly, raising up his hand with one finger extended.</p><br><p>"Pure, innocent good people like Nelya, they are like flawless pearls floating in our, dirty, murky ocean full of evil. Yet, no matter what, they don't lose their purity, remaining as honest as before - pure goodness."</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Gladius tilted his head:</p><br><p>"But, such people, these lumps of pure goodness have one critical flaw - do you know what it is?"</p><br><p>Zarot gulped, shaking his head slowly. He didn't understand what Gladius was getting at, but he was in no position to refuse.</p><br><p>"Their main problem is that they're too kind!"</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Explore stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>All Zarot felt was utter confusion.</p><br><p>"You see... Despite what you did to Nelya, disgracing and humiliating her as a woman and noblewoman, she has no anger or hatred towards you. Do the same thing ten more times and she will forgive you."</p><br><p>With a theatrical wave of his hand, Gladius looked up:</p><br><p>"She's too kind to take revenge on you, or at least show anger and hatred towards you. So it becomes a vicious cycle, you as evil can constantly hurt the good, the good will never get back at you or get as dirty as you, but..."</p><br><p>Gladius paused for a few seconds, rubbing his chin thoughtfully as if his mind was wandering in complex contemplation.</p><br><p>"Does this dilemma have a solution?"</p><br><p>Though it was a question, Gladius didn't need answers from anyone.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, he turned into a shadow, appearing right in front of Zarot, a wide grin on his face.</p><br><p>"Of course there is! Evil can only defeat even greater evil! Thus evil will help good, isn't that ironic?"</p><br><p>Zarot's face turned pale, realizing the hidden meaning behind Gladius' words.</p><br><p>Not waiting for some unique reaction from his victim, Gladius received a frowning expression.</p><br><p>"Well, this is all just thinking out loud."</p><br><p>Shrugging his shoulders, Gladius turned his head glaring at Xyrea.</p><br><p>"Xyrea, let's get started. Don't forget to write a report, the Marzo Family and Franz Balo have asked for everything to be in detail."</p><br><p>With a face as serene as ever, Xyrea nodded deeply. Gladius's words were equal to orders to her, which she would carry out flawlessly.</p><br><p>"Sure, after all. It is up to us to kill someone who is already dead. It's a simple task."</p><br><p>Realizing that his final moments were upon him, Zarot's despair reached its limit. Even though he accepted his fate already, his desire to live had not disappeared.</p><br><p>"No... Please! Don't do it!"</p><br><br><p>"Sorry for the delay! Your latte with lots of sugar and caramel syrup is ready. Extra large!"</p><br><p>The girl with a cute smile on her face reached out holding a large glass of coffee, this was one coffee stall of which there were thousands in the Citadel.</p><br><p>For many, it was a way to get a quick boost of energy before heading off to work, and for others, it was simply a way to enjoy the taste of their favorite beverage.</p><br><p>Nodding slightly, not sharing the girl's vigor, Adam made the payment and took the glass from her hands.</p><br><p>Seeing his emotionless expression, the girl puffed up her cheeks, leaning on her hand.</p><br><p>"Pfffft! Is it so hard to just say thank you? Agh... it's the same thing every day."</p><br><p>Her voice didn't reach Adam as he walked away already gazing thoughtfully into the hot coffee, jets of steam drifting upwards passing in front of his calm eyes.</p><br><p>He decided to try coffee instead of soda today, though he added just as much sugar if not more.</p><br><p>"Agh, how can she even drink something as bitter as espresso? Damn, I'm not sure I can handle it. Getting used to the taste of coffee is harder than killing monsters."</p><br><p>Shaking his head Adam took the first sip, a pleasant sweetness filled his mouth, soon only the bitterness remained.</p><br><p>Shuddering slightly, Adam headed onward.</p><br><p>This morning he wasn't just taking a walk, he had a purpose - he was going to meet with his Operator and discuss what they were going to do next.</p><br><p>'Yeah... The Rule of Power is finally complete. Osana is now free, but... fuck, how much time did I waste on this? Nessa and Katrin, how far have you two gotten while I was dealing with the nobles? Especially Katrin...</p><br><p>Damn, after receiving the gene of the Plague Reaper, she's become a real monster.'</p><br><p>Immersed in his thoughts, Adam gradually reached the right place - an ordinary quiet park in one part of the Third Ring.</p><br><p>In popular and large-scale parks there were always a lot of people, because besides trees and plants some important events were constantly taking place, but here... there was no one, or rather almost no one.</p><br><p>A girl with neck-length black hair and green eyes was sitting on a lonely bench near a quiet fountain.</p><br><p>Today, she decided to go back to where she started - a strict official style expressed both in her black formal clothes and straight hairstyle, as well as a minimum of makeup.</p><br><br><p>On her lap lay a tablet, a few blue screens were preloaded with information. In her right hand was a small cup of coffee from a nearby coffee shop, bitter and black, completely different from Adam's sweet version.</p><br><br><p>Stopping beside her, Adam smiled slightly.</p><br><p>"Well, well, someone decided to go back to the old style? Honestly, it's kinda weird for me to see you like this again."</p><br><p>Turning around slowly, Silvana's corners went up. She took another sip and nodded slightly.</p><br><p>"Yes, what's more, I bought myself some new things. Thanks to you, I was able to make some good money."</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam gave her a questioning look.</p><br><p>A sly glint traveled across Silvana's eyes.</p><br><p>"Oh, don't you know? I bet on you winning at The Rule of Power."</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam muttered glancing at her tablet, "What's the next thing to do? The nobles took me too long."</p><br><p>In response, Silvana just shrugged.</p><br><p>"Whatever you want my Phantom, but... I'd love to see you in battle against monsters again."</p><br>
