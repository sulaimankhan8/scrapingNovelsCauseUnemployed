            <br><p>The first part of the test for Silvana was the questions from the Evolution Tree, then they had to exchange memories with Adam to accept and understand each other.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Silvana found the first part of the trial much more difficult than Adam's memories, though she saw something she didn't expect.</p><br><p>One question lodged deeply in her mind:</p><br><p>[Are you willing to sacrifice yourself for Adam?]</p><br><p>The answer to that question was known, Silvana answered honestly, and now only one last ordeal awaited her before Gene Diffusion ended.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The energy streams slowly swirling around them became much denser and shook actively.</p><br><p>Refesa and Stina looked at each other, they knew what that meant.</p><br><p>"Well, well, it looks like they've reached the end already. Pretty fast, it's only been two hours. Looks like they just skimmed through most of each other's memories."</p><br><p>"Is that bad?" Stina inquired wanting to know more about Gene Diffusion.</p><br><p>In response, Refesa just shook her head.</p><br><p>"Nah, it's probably even a good thing. Those who watch other people's memories for a long time probably do it because they want to find something secret and hidden. It shows not curiosity, but a lack of trust."</p><br><p>Taking some time, Stina nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"I'm sure they passed the first two stages without much trouble, but... now begins not a test, but the real challenge."</p><br><p>At the same moment, energy gradually began to flow into Silvana, increasing the pressure on her body, but only in small amounts for now.</p><br><br><p>Then, while Adam was still dormant, Silvana opened her eyes.</p><br><p>[Are you willing to sacrifice yourself for ...?]</p><br><p>Slowly, Silvana rose, ruffling her hair with her hand. She was lying on a spacious bed with several white pillows and a long blanket.</p><br><p>"Agh... What was that even? What a weird dream..."</p><br><p>Silvana muttered, slowly rising as she walked over to the massive mirror in her room.</p><br><p>Her body was taut and her muscles were clearly visible, both on her arms and legs and on her abs.</p><br><p>"Hah, I'm still the same as before."</p><br><p>A wide smile was on her face as a pleasant smell wafted from the kitchen. Silvana's eyes went wide, sparks flying as she quickly changed her clothes and headed into the kitchen with a confident stride.</p><br><p>The wide hallways of her large home done in white light colors were her only obstacle before she reached the right place.</p><br><p>A tall man with thick black hair stood in front of the stove, fully immersed in his work. He wore a white apron slightly soiled and in front of him were several frying pans burning over a moderate fire.</p><br><p>The enticing smell of a soon-to-be breakfast filled the entire kitchen and spread along their massive house, calling to the one for whom it was all made.</p><br><br><p>Silvana took a few steps forward, smooth but rather heavy, catching the man's attention.</p><br><p>He slowly turned around looking at her over his shoulder. His blue eyes were as deep as the ocean, full of not only trust but something else...</p><br><p>"Finally awake? You usually get up half an hour early to do your warm-up. Is something wrong?" Adam asked calmly</p><br><p>A slight smile reflected on Silvana's face, she shrugged and walked over to the fridge.</p><br><p>"Nah, nothing serious, just had a long and strange dream."</p><br><br><p>With those words, Silvana took a large two-liter milk carton from the side, lifted it above her, and with a quick motion unscrewed the lid.</p><br><p>In a few gulps, as if it were a small cup of coffee, Silvana drank half of the carton, leaving the rest for later.</p><br><p>Then, a calm, measured voice came from outside:</p><br><p>"Should I order milk? You drink it like a newborn bear cub."</p><br><br><p>Silvana let out a deep sigh full of pleasure.</p><br><p>"Yeah... Order as much as you can, but... that's not what's important right now."</p><br><p>With a slight smile, Silvana walked over to Adam, looking at the many dishes that were coming to completion.</p><br><p>"What are we having for breakfast today? I see you're spoiling me with your culinary masterpieces as always."</p><br><p>"Well, I've spent a lot of time and effort to learn how to cook well, so it would be foolish not to use those skills. What's more..."</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Silvana, swiping a glance from bottom to top.</p><br><p>"You Phantoms eat a lot more than normal humans. Your appetite... Damn, it's my biggest daily challenge."</p><br><p>Smiling weakly, Silvana shrugged innocently, she couldn't help it.</p><br><p>"So... What's on the menu?"</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand:</p><br><p>"Spinach and mushroom omelette with lots of cheese, shrimp, avocado, and citrus salad, cereal with fruit and berries on milk, fried chicken and rice, and some marbled beef steaks. Of drinks: coffee, fresh-squeezed orange juice, and... milk if you want more."</p><br><p>"What about dessert, then?"</p><br><p>Adam rolled his eyes, skillfully flipping the pan to toss the contents up for mixing.</p><br><p>"Have some cookies and tea, will that do?"</p><br><p>In response, Silvana licked her lip.</p><br><p>"Yeah, that'll be perfect."</p><br><p>Then, standing behind Adam, a sly smile appeared on Silvana's face with a devious glance.</p><br><p>'But...' Silvana muttered inwardly.</p><br><p>Enjoy new adventures from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Her eyes dipped below Adam's waist, staying long in one place, making her fingertips tingle.</p><br><p>'I'd prefer a slightly different dessert...'</p><br><br><p>Five minutes later, Adam finished preparing an elaborate breakfast and set many plates full of food on the table.</p><br><p>He made something for himself as well, but it was only a small portion compared to what Silvana was about to eat.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wild with the different meals prepared with care and following her preferences.</p><br><p>"Bon appetit!" Silvana exclaimed happily before starting her breakfast.</p><br><p>Adam only nodded quietly watching Silvana.</p><br><p>The first few minutes passed in silence as Silvana couldn't take the time to do anything but eat and give praise to Adam for his skills.</p><br><p>"Damn! How lucky I am to have such an Operator!"</p><br><p>"I just made breakfast for you like I always do."</p><br><p>"Hah, it doesn't matter, it's fucking delicious!"</p><br><p>Adam's corners went up, he couldn't hide the fact that he was pleased to hear that.</p><br><p>"So... When do we leave for the mission?"</p><br><p>He got straight to the point, with a calm serious face.</p><br><p>"We were given a week to prepare, we used it. Now we have about three days."</p><br><p>Silvana grinned widely, a flame burning deep in her eyes.</p><br><p>"Tomorrow. There's no more time to waste, or the military might get angry."</p><br><p>With his arms crossed over his chest, Adam nodded.</p><br>
