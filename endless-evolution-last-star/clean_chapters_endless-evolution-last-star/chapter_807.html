            <br><p>Clash. Clash. Clash.</p><br><p>Adam and the Crimson Monarch attacked each other in an endless loop. Neither of them seemed to be winning, since after Katrin's help, Adam became fast and strong enough to fight against the Trident on equal terms.</p><br><p>However... Viron and Gnash, watching the fight from afar, clearly realized that Adam's strength was not enough.</p><br><p>Viron remained as calm as ever, at the same time Gnash's teeth were chattering, she was biting her nails in an approaching panic.</p><br><p>"No... This is not good. For Adam to win he must overwhelm the Crimson Monarch, not fight him on par! He doesn't have that much energy and such powerful regeneration. In a battle of exhaustion, Adam has no chance of winning!"</p><br><p>The other Phantoms understood this as well. And... some of them were foolish enough to jump right into action without permission.</p><br><br><p>Blue and green projectiles flew out from the side of the fortress, the two Phantoms nodded to each other and attacked the Crimson Monarch, thinking it was a good idea.</p><br><p>Gnash's eyes went wide as she turned sharply in their direction.</p><br><p>"You idiots! What the fuck are you doing?!"</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Crimson Monarch noticed the projectiles coming toward him.</p><br><p>"Well, well... looks like your fellow Phantoms decided to help you out."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, the next moment he was back to combat mode.</p><br><p>Clash. Clash. Clash.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch blocked several of Adam's punches. Even when Adam created white lines with purple rings, it was no longer his trump card. The trident was strong enough to block any of Adam's attacks.</p><br><p>Then, the Crimson Monarch bounced back sharply and raised the trident high into the sky.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, several thunder bolts rained down on him from the sky, straight into the tip of the trident. The great force of thunder traveled along his weapon to burst out again in a chaotic pattern, raining down on the fortress like a lightning hail.</p><br><p>The projectiles didn't even manage to reach the Crimson Monarch, the lightning bolts destroyed them in flight.</p><br><p>"However..." The Crimson Monarch proclaimed pointing at the serpent spire, "I'm afraid this won't be enough to show the other Phantoms that I didn't forget my promise."</p><br><p>Spark. Spark. Spark.</p><br><p>Electrical discharges ran along the crystal as a new force of thunder in a single laser crashed down on the fortress.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch turned around, seeing as in a devastating blast, the laser reached its target.</p><br><p>"None of you will see the dawn. You will all perish."</p><br><br><p>A second before the spire crystal shot out, the Phantoms tried to defend themselves from the falling electrical discharges. They scattered to the sides, used their abilities to block the lightning.</p><br><p>But... soon a dark red glow fell upon the fortress. The flash of the oncoming laser was seen by every Phantom.</p><br><p>Gnash was one of the first to react.</p><br><p>"Fuck! Viron! We have to do something! Otherwise, that laser will destroy the fortress!"</p><br><br><p>Before she could do anything, Viron lunged at her. In a second she was on his shoulder, in a tight grip she couldn't get out of.</p><br><p>Backing away from the brief incomprehension, Gnash began pounding on his back at half strength.</p><br><p>"Hey! What the hell are you doing? Let go of me! We have to help the others!"</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Viron's hand crashed roughly onto her butt, surely leaving a distinct red mark.</p><br><p>Gnash's face froze, she didn't know how to react or what it even was.</p><br><p>"Shut up. I'm saving your life, miss I'll Help Everyone."</p><br><p>Without further ado, with complete confidence in his actions, Viron stepped forward, jumping off the edge of the tower seconds before the laser fired.</p><br><br><p>They fell into the murky water, aiming for the bottom of the ring around the fortress. The gate guardian was still around, but Viron's aura was so frightening that the Blinding Sylphyre would not risk it.</p><br><p>Bubbles whizzed by next to Viron's calm face, while Gnash's was red with shame.</p><br><p>Then, a shudder ran across the surface as a torrent of red flame the size of a tower rose in the middle of the fortress.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The tremble was felt hundreds of meters away from the fortress. Electric discharges ran along the passageways and stone slabs, seriously injuring the Phantoms who had not managed to escape.</p><br><p>Apparently, everyone in the vicinity of the laser blast had died. None of their level's defenses were capable of protecting them.</p><br><p>The walls were still intact, the strike hit the center of the fortress since the Crimson Monarch's goal was to kill as many Phantoms as possible in one move.</p><br><p>"Good. We won't be disturbed again."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch nodded deeply, returning his gaze to Adam.</p><br><p>"You're running out of time Adam. Do you want to surrender voluntarily?"</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."</p><br><p>Heavy breaths came out in hot steam, Adam's body approaching its limit due to hundreds of attacks with no progress.</p><br><p>"Never. I don't know why you need me, but you may not even dream of it."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch pointed his trident at the ground, watching Adam, who lost his cold.</p><br><p>"Dreams are for the weak. The strong have no dreams, only goals. No matter how far your goal is, if you are willing to commit to anything, sooner or later you will achieve it. Unlike unattainable, unfulfilling dreams."</p><br><p>Their frames trembled as they continued the fight.</p><br><br><p>Seconds merged into minutes, into an endless stream, into a battle of attrition in which Adam had no such outcome as victory.</p><br><br><p>The blunt tip of the trident slammed into Adam's stomach, throwing him back into a lump of sand.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's aura did weaken, but Adam could no longer keep up with his movements. Regeneration from energy was failing to heal his bruises and cuts, fatigue was catching up with him.</p><br><p>With trembling legs, Adam slowly rose, in a desperate attempt to regain his balance.</p><br><p>His eyes were clearer than a thousand words - he wasn't going to give up, not even a thought flashed across his mind.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch inwardly frowned heavily.</p><br><p>'This is bad... A man like him will fight until he dies - that's his decision. That doesn't suit me. But... I have one solution.'</p><br><p>While Adam prepared for the next clash, the Crimson Monarch turned around directing his gaze towards the two silhouettes.</p><br><p>Unlike all the other monsters, these two were quite close to Adam and the Crimson Monarch the whole time.</p><br><p>The Blind Sinner and the Dormant Lord sensed this. Without fear, they looked into his deep eyes.</p><br><p>"You two appear to be worthy fighters. Better than any of the thousands of monsters in these lands. You've seen how much stronger the other monsters become with just my energy or a drop of blood."</p><br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch stepped forward, trident dropping into the ground and his left hand going to his right one.</p><br><p>"Become my servants and help me capture Adam Vinter. In return, you will receive an according reward from me."</p><br><p>Then, the Crimson Monarch ripped two fingers off his hand, not a hint of pain showing on his face.</p><br><p>"Each of you will receive one of my fingers. You will be able to absorb some of my power and evolve. Your progress will be far greater than the Frost Maiden who received a blood clot from me!"</p>
