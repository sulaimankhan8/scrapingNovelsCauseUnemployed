            <br><br><p>Silvana asked looking intently at Adam. They were at Silvana's house, standing in the middle of the hall, it was the most spacious place in her apartment.</p><br><p>"Yeah, no more nobles, scientists, military, and so on... Just me, you, and monsters..."</p><br><p>With those words, Adam closed his eyes, immersing himself in his inner space.</p><br><p>[You're finally here...]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree's voice rang out, echoing and spreading through the vast darkness.</p><br><p>Adam opened his eyes with a wide smile, looking at the majestic bright tree, full of powerful light - his energy.</p><br><p>"I hope you won't get in my way this time?" Adam lifted his eyes, full of energy and mildly pleased that he moved forward.</p><br><p>[No... Your fight against that young man... and... your alliance with.... with... Silvana Desio...</p><br><p>I'm afraid you have no idea... how much stronger you've become...]</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the First Wall trembled, releasing an eerie, aggressive aura. However, the First Wall, or rather what lurked within it, was not trying to frighten Adam, on the contrary, it wanted to attract his attention.</p><br><p>The purple flames rippling from the First Wall traveled in waves in a circle, wanting to shine like a bright sun.</p><br><p>[Adam... My words are the truth...]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree uttered loudly, piercing his mind.</p><br><p>[Nevertheless... I have no power over the Two Walls... and... your path... You did a great job... You made sure your First Wall would be of the highest difficulty...]</p><br><p>Although Adam's smile remained intact, those words slightly startled Adam inside.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree wasn't exaggerating or deceiving, Adam clearly understood that.</p><br><p>"Agh, you know, there's nothing wrong with difficult fights. After all... If I would have lost in my first fight, no..."</p><br><p>Adam's gaze darkened as he sadly lowered his head.</p><br><p>"If Aiden Henk wouldn't have sent me to the Dead Lands to be torn apart by monsters, I wouldn't be here..."</p><br><br><p>Silence fell for a long moment, and even the First Wall calmed down realizing what Adam's mind was occupied with.</p><br><p>[Indeed... There's no point in denying cause and effect... And... Adam... You wouldn't have the Spark in you...]</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide along with copious trembling, as he glanced at Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>"What...? What did you say? How the hell do you know that?!" Adam exclaimed with eyes full of indignation.</p><br><p>Neither Silvana nor he knew a way to determine whether or not a person would have the Spark, nor did the free scientists and the government.</p><br><p>If there was some way to know in advance, the government would administer a test at birth and train such talented youths to become Phantoms.</p><br><p>This would have allowed them to create a Phantom Academy and train people with the talent for years, knowing that one day they would all have the Spark and become Phantoms.</p><br><p>However, none of this happened because no one could know in advance if a person would have the Spark, or not.</p><br><p>[I feel that way...]</p><br><p>All Adam got from the Evolution Tree was an ambiguous answer.</p><br><p>[Your the Two Walls... They... They... They...]</p><br><p>Continue reading at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Adam tried to listen to every word Evolution Tree said, but he couldn't make anything out.</p><br><p>Then, after a long time, the Evolution Tree spoke again:</p><br><p>[Adam... What are you waiting for...? The First Wall... It's waiting for you... But... Remember...</p><br><p>I have no power over them... Just you and your First Wall...]</p><br><p>With a deep nod, Adam stepped forward, approaching the First Wall. Strangely enough, the First Wall was calm, its surface as smooth as water, there was not a single ripple.</p><br><p>However, Adam felt that the First Wall wanted to contact him as much as he did.</p><br><p>"Fine... Show me what awaits me... You've changed a few times since your appearance, but the same happened to me."</p><br><p>His eyes grew colder as he stepped forward, touching the First Wall with the tip of his finger.</p><br><p>"You're evolving as much as I am, but I don't mind facing worthy challenges."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The black surface shuddered before drawing Adam's hand into itself like a viscous liquid. Adam didn't resist, he felt no threat from the First Wall and his confidence in the power over his inner space was absolute.</p><br><p>Gradually, the liquid became more and more active, the First Wall absorbed Adam without intending to stop.</p><br><p>The mysterious ink first reached his elbow, then his whole shoulder disappeared into the First Wall and his eyes were a few centimeters from the surface.</p><br><br><p>With a sharp jerk, the First Wall plunged Adam into itself, engulfing him completely.</p><br><p>Adam's blue eyes were wide open, but he saw nothing but darkness. Soon, the color of his eyes lost their brightness, gradually becoming darker until only black remained.</p><br><p>Then, Adam's real body began to emanate tiny particles of energy, so small that Silvana's eyes, the eyes of a mere human, were unable to discern them.</p><br><p>Yet, because she had undergone Gene Diffusion and had some of her energy she sensed that something was wrong.</p><br><p>For a split second, she saw that there was a black field around Adam, protecting him like a veil, before quickly disappearing from her sight.</p><br><p>Neither she nor Adam knew it, but something like this happened to Adam before - when he, along with Katrin, Nessa, and Osana, had returned to the Citadel on the fighter from the Fume Cathedral.</p><br><p>That day, Adam was lying against the wall next to Plague Reaper's corpse, and... the exact same energy, two fields, caused him to fight Plague Reaper in his inner space.</p><br><p>Such was the effect of the Radiant at that time.</p><br><p>But... now, Adam's opponent was alive and more than real, being in truly distant lands.</p><br><p>The First Wall became Adam's guide, showing him what kind of opponent he created by his actions and decisions.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes grew a little wider, looking at the hundreds of fragments floating around him.</p><br><p>Rivers of blood flowed from the crimson walls, and skulls mixed with bones gushed in scarlet waterfalls into the abyss beneath the flickering shadows waiting for new victims, the red walls reflected the bright light of the fires unwilling to hide, believing in its power lurking in the depths.</p>
