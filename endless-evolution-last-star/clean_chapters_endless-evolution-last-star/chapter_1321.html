            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1321: Half Death?</strong></p><br><p>Over the past hour, apart from drinking a few cups of tea and eating some desserts, Adam had learned a few curious things about Norax that he wasn’t prepared for in either universe.</p><br><p>This was a person who, for the sake of his new hobby, had received help directly from the Citadel to get everything he needed for an enjoyable gaming experience. Not only a large screen, gamepads, and the most powerful console available at the time, but also an entire satellite above for communication!</p><br><p>Adam looked up as if he wanted to see the satellite even through the walls and clouds, imagining its size and trying to understand how absurd it all was from some perspective.</p><br><p>Humans and monsters were natural enemies, everyone knew that, and no one had any doubts about it.</p><br><p>‘How would I have reacted two years ago, and ordinary people like me back then, if we had learned that somewhere in the world there was a monster who had been given a satellite so he could play video games and receive timely updates?</p><br><p>Adam would never have believed such nonsense.</p><br><p>It was practically insane!</p><br><p>But he himself became part of it and, for the first time in several months, enjoyed a simple video game, even though he constantly lost because Norax had vast experience in this and many other games.</p><br><p>“Hey! Let me win at least once! I’m sure you’ve spent more years playing this game than I’ve been alive!” Adam complained, trying his best to reduce Norax’s HP to at least half, but Norax successfully blocked and dodged all his attacks.</p><br><p>“Hahaha! What are you talking about?” Norax laughed. “This is the last game in the series, practically a new release! It’s only been two years, and I hope they manage to release another one before the World Wipe happens!”</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow. “By the way… What are you going to do after the World Wipe? I mean, it will take several decades for the Citadel to fully recover and for humanity to be able to afford to make video games!”</p><br><p>Norax shrugged carelessly. For him, the question of the World Wipe had long since become something mundane; he had experienced many World Wipes in his lifetime, like most monsters of his level. It was both a curse and a blessing.</p><br><p>“Well, the first time I made that mistake, and I almost died of boredom, however!” He grinned and tapped himself on the temple several times. “Now I’m smarter, I’m developing not only in games but also in life!”</p><br><br><p>He pushed Adam’s character aside and continued.</p><br><p>“I save a few dozen games, don’t touch them, and don’t learn anything about them at all. Usually, that’s enough until the Citadel recovers and new games appear.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded. He was sure that all video games were stored in the Zero Day Vault. All it took was one or more palm-sized discs with enormous storage capacity.</p><br><p>“Norax, does that mean that from time to time you work with people and even help the Citadel in some way?” Adam asked cautiously. “I mean, I doubt the Citadel would give you all this or even the opportunity to buy something like they gave Misty if you had a hostile relationship.”</p><br><p>After a short pause, he nodded.</p><br><p>“I don’t think there’s any point in hiding it, but monsters and humans sometimes work together. Don’t think of it as something too serious, like war or plans against major factions, that’s too much. However, more often than not, it’s better to cooperate with each other than to kill.</p><br><p>“I’m sure you’ve done this several times in your journey. At the very least, you chose not to kill Nollura and decided to work with her as well as with the monsters from the dark forest and Targon at the Glass Bridge.”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened.</p><br><br><br><p>“Don’t be surprised. I knew a lot about you even before you arrived at the Forgotten Mills. Monsters of my level keep an eye on all new talents, no matter which side they’re on.</p><br><p>“As you understand, you are one of those talents, and the situation with you became a real storm in narrow circles after the First Star brought you to the Dark Shore. You’re lucky to be alive; it’s a rare occurrence.”</p><br><p>Recalling his short journey to the most dangerous territory in the world, Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>“Yes, I know about that. To be honest, I’d like to return to the Dark Shore. I’m sure it’s a dangerous place, but it’s just as interesting. However, I’m too weak for that right now.”</p><br><p>Norax’s eyes grew deeper, as did his voice.</p><br><br><p>In an instant, his aura changed, sending a shiver down Adam’s spine.</p><br><p>“Especially the last part. You are too weak, and we must fix that, mustn’t we?”</p><br><p>Adam gulped, realizing that the time for casual conversation was over.</p><br><p>“Yes. The Energy Axis, Karso said, I must rebuild it. Misty sent me to you. Will you help me do that?”</p><br><p>Norax waved his hand dismissively as his threatening aura instantly disappeared.</p><br><p>“Sure! I know a few useful tricks. We’ll start with one of them right now.”</p><br><br><p>Norax selected another game, one for a single player. Staring at the screen, he addressed the darkness to his side:</p><br><p>“Narica, it’s time to begin. First, let’s see how much he wants our help.”</p><br><br><p>“Beat him half to death.”</p><br><p>“W-What?!” Adam exclaimed in shock as he got up from the ground.</p><br><br><p>Narica stepped out of the shadows and bowed low, holding her palm to her chest.</p><br><p>“As you wish. I hope this young man can live up to your expectations, although…” She looked at Adam with disdain. “He doesn’t look as special as you said he would be. I don’t even know how he managed to defeat Mr. Ureyn.”</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything in response, Narica was in front of him as a wave of darkness engulfed them both.</p><br><p>The next moment, they found themselves outside Norax’s mill, near the highest point.</p><br><p>With a gaze as cold as ancient ice, Narica drove her foot straight into Adam’s stomach, throwing him down to the ground with tremendous force like a cannonball.</p><br><p>“Hang in there, young man,” she said without pity. “I always follow my master’s orders.”</p>
