            <br><p>Power Gene - This particular gene Adam got after killing Steel Knight, his first Crown Type monster, not counting Brass Puppet who was his Initial Monster.</p><br><p>Sure, given Adam's current power level, he would defeat Steel Knight in one hit, but what was important was another thing - his memories. At that point, it was a deadly opponent that Adam had barely won a battle against.</p><br><p>[Power Gene - Steel Knight.]</p><br><br><p>You have gained a portion of the power of an extremely capable monster - the Steel Knight, one of the pillars of power of which was experience. Now, you will learn much faster and more efficiently, especially if you are training with a weapon.</p><br><p>Also, you have become slightly stronger and faster, and your defense has also increased minorly] Information about his Power Gene flashed through Adam's mind. His Power Gene looked like a shield with two crossed swords inside a crystal sphere.</p><br><p>Then, the Power Gene shone brightly at the peak of its energy and the shield cracked, shattering into tiny shards in an instant.</p><br><p>The two swords covered in dense white energy approached each other and began to merge into one. It seemed like they were melting under the high temperature.</p><br><p>Soon, the two swords turned into one with a long blade whose parts were very different from each other. The right side of the blade was straight and flat, while the left side had square teeth running along the entire blade.</p><br><br><p>Again, a page from the Vault appeared before Adam's eyes, which now held virtually all the information about his inner space.</p><br><p>[Power Gene - Desecrated Sword]</p><br><br><p>A symbol, remembering its original origin, not abandoning its history, but accepting the changes of its current owner. It didn't matter if the sword was rusty, holy, or broken, each sword had its own history closely tied to the path it passed].</p><br><p>"Hmm... Nothing again... Nothing specific, no Traits, just nothing... How am I supposed to figure out what my new Power Gene does? Furthermore, why does this sword look so strange?" Adam cast his gaze upwards.</p><br><p>The Desecrated Sword was simultaneously emitting calm and threatening auras, but to Adam, it wasn't bad or good. Now this sword, this Power Gene was part of his power and all he could do was take it for granted.</p><br><br><p>The Desecrated Sword shuddered before crashing into the Evolution Tree, causing its majestic bark to crack. Desecrated Sword crashed into Evolution Tree as if it weighed as much as a mountain, so even Evolution Tree's bark couldn't withstand its fall without damage.</p><br><p>Then, a thick, dark crimson energy resembling blood emerged from beneath the Desecrated Sword, slowly covering it with a red sphere.</p><br><p>With no more changes happening, the new Adam's Power Gene was ready.</p><br><p>But... it wasn't the only gene that was waiting to change.</p><br><p>Adam gulped glancing at his Initial Gene that was at the very center of the Evolution Tree. It was the core on which literally everything depended. If the Phantom didn't have an Initial Gene, it wasn't the Phantom.</p><br><p>For Phantom, the Initial Gene was more important than food, water, or even air, because without the Initial Gene, Phantom could survive for no more than seven minutes.</p><br><p>Katrin experienced these time constraints to the fullest. If not for Plague Reaper's gene, she would die.</p><br><p>"Damn... Are you going to change too?" Adam muttered in a trembling voice staring at the ball of threads - this was what his Initial Gene.</p><br><p>When he had killed Silver Weaver, getting his first gene, he would forever remember what his Initial Gene looked like. Sure, it may not have seemed threatening, but it didn't make any sense.</p><br><p>The purpose of the Initial Gene was not to scare anyone, only Phantom saw his Initial Gene.</p><br><p>The Initial Gene was to demonstrate its essence and the ball of threads was the best representation of Adam's abilities.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The ball of threads trembled, bright light trying to escape from within, through tiny gaps among the tightly woven threads.</p><br><p>Then, the ball unraveled, letting out all the threads, there seemed to be an infinite amount of them, and if one tied them together into one long thread, it was possible to pierce the whole world with its length.</p><br><p>Adam didn't say anything or think, he didn't even breathe, gazing in awe at the waving threads and the majestic energy streams coming out of the center of his Evolution Tree.</p><br><br><p>As if at the whirlwind's will, all the threads and energy abruptly returned, but in a completely different form, yet without losing their nature.</p><br><p>"Oh... I see..." Adam gulped, his gaze deepening.</p><br><p>His blue eyes reflected a long needle, hovering evenly, the tip pointing downward. From the tip came many threads flying upward, like the trail of a comet that was ready to crash to earth, with all its power.</p><br><p>Adam turned to his Vault expecting another page to come to him, but... the Vault didn't store knowledge of the Initial Gene, not about that.</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could realize anything, a ghostly needle came out of his Initial Gene. In a heartbeat, it pierced his head, entering directly into his mind.</p><br><br><p>Those two simple words that seemed to have no special meaning rang through Adam's mind.</p><br><p>[Threads... Some use them to sew up their clothes, some use them to create a new suit, some use them to change a mistake, and some have such great power that they can sew the very fabric of reality.</p><br><p>What about you? Who knows... It's up to you to choose how to use your threads. You're experienced enough to put that power to good use on your path. Now, you can create your own threads and manipulate them at your will like a genuine weaver.</p><br><p>Fabric, clothing, or reality? No... change your fate with your threads].</p><br><p>Adam's eyes snapped open as he found himself in the real world, blinking in bewilderment. He couldn't believe what had just happened.</p><br><p>The energy continued to flow out of his body, and... it seemed like it wasn't going to stop.</p><br><p>"Is it done already...?" Silvana asked with a slight worry in her voice.</p><br><p>Douglas shook his head.</p><br><p>"No. There's still something really interesting left. Hahaha." Douglas chuckled, knowing what was about to happen.</p><br><p>Adam wanted to turn to Silvana, but no sooner did he do that than his eyes glowed brightly and he passed out.</p><br><br><p>Adam fell to the ground, and the rectangular beam of energy coming out of his body began to slowly descend.</p><br><p>However, the energy didn't get weaker, it condensed, going to completely cover Adam like an impenetrable dome through which no one would be able to see what was going on inside.</p><br><p>Before the dome closed completely, hiding Adam from view, Douglas and Silvana had time to notice something.</p><br><p>Adam's gloves, his Nexus, they had just disappeared. But... to where?</p><br><p>Adam didn't notice it, he was too focused on Power Gene and Initial Gene, but the ghostly copy of his Nexus hovering next to Evolution Tree was gone.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Space trembled when inside the Gene Cube covering the area around the Vault, a pair of gloves appeared.</p><br><p>Then, the gloves flew out into the inner space, they trembled, they were not supposed to be here, it was a physical version.</p><br><p>But, it wasn't a mistake as soon massive energy streams came out of the Evolution Tree, enveloping the gloves in a solid energy layer, creating a cocoon for them out of which something completely new was going to be born.</p>
