            <br><p>Phantoms and monsters became stronger in many ways, each with many opportunities to increase their power.</p><br><p>It could be new abilities, long training, experience, improved skill in their weapons, or even an aura.</p><br><p>But, in its purest form, everything started and ended with one crucial thing - energy, density, and quantity.</p><br><p>It didn't matter how many different abilities, experience, and weapons a Phantom or monster had if someone like the Dormant Lord would kill them in the blink of an eye. Dozens of attacks from weaker creatures wouldn't even leave a scratch on his body.</p><br><p>It was as pointless as trying to break a steel beam over and over by attacking it with a simple branch fallen from a tree. It would be more likely for the branch to shatter into splinters and the attacker's hand to be wiped to bloody dust than for the iron beam to receive any visible damage.</p><br><p>From time to time, each Phantom experienced a similar leap in strength, especially when it went from one level to another, from K0 to K1 and particularly from K1 to K2.</p><br><p>Unlike the previous level, K2 was divided into many steps, at this level, the Phantom gained new power gradually, taking one step at a time. Initially the first Wall, then the first star, second, third, fourth, and only then the Star Seal.</p><br><p>Each step was an explosive burst of energy for the Phantom and a step closer to the second keyhole on the Lock.</p><br><p>Usually, the Phantom would get stronger after destroying the First Wall without even reaching the appearance of the Wall Star, but this was not Adam's case.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>White flames, pure dense energy blasted in all directions from Adam's body, the monsters working on the bloody circle froze in place.</p><br><p>There was no room for fear in their minds, they were completely consumed with awe, feeling the creature in front of them grow stronger by the second.</p><br><p>Adam's auras and shockwaves from the occasional bursts of his raging energy were active enough to reach the top of the fortress.</p><br><p>At that moment, the Dormant Lord and the Blind Sinner instinctively activated their auras, they felt that just now, in the depths of the fortress, someone equal - a third player - appeared.</p><br><p>But, Adam was far away, they didn't even know it was him, so a second later, the Dormant Lord and the Blind Sinner returned to their fierce battle.</p><br><p>Katrin, Viron, and Gnash looked at each other.</p><br><p>In the beginning, they had received information about the fortress, but since that moment there was no news from Unknown Phantom or its Operator, they completely ignored the events happening above.</p><br><p>Viron took a deep breath, helping Gnash to his feet after his fall.</p><br><p>"So... the Unknown Phantom has reached its target, but what does that mean for us?"</p><br><p>Hope appeared in the Phantom's eyes. The defense of the fortress was relatively stable, but the casualties were gradually increasing while the main threat, the Dormant Lord, still loomed over them.</p><br><p>Gnash bit her lip, looking away unhappily.</p><br><p>"It would be nice if he came back to us now and helped us. It's better than nothing."</p><br><br><p>Katrin's harsh voice thundered all around. Her fists were clenched tightly and a great grimace was on her face.</p><br><p>"I don't argue, we could use help, any help, but I don't want you to even think about immediately forgiving that Phantom for what he did! If he had remained in the fortress, your friends and comrades would not died, some managed to escape that fate, but not all were so lucky."</p><br><p>Her speech did not add to the Phantoms' fighting spirit, but that was not her purpose. Gloom and seriousness filled their gazes. They realized that Katrin was right.</p><br><p>Many problems could be avoided if they were solved at the beginning before they turned into something really serious.</p><br><p>Katrin waved his hand, demonstratively releasing his powerful aura.</p><br><p>"Forget about that Phantom, he's a coward and an egotist. We can handle the Eclipse and the waves of monsters without his help. Think about how to handle the crisis with current resources, don't hope for a miracle."</p><br><p>No one said anything, but there was a slight fire in the eyes of the crowd. Katrin wasn't trying to convince them that they already won or that under her leadership they would definitely succeed, she made them look at the situation from a realistic perspective.</p><br><p>Gnash snorted, with a limp gait she stepped aside.</p><br><p>'Pffft, Katrin... You say not to hope for a miracle? But, didn't it save you last time? If you didn't have a pocket miracle in the form of Adam Vinter, the Plague Reaper would have turned you into worm fodder long ago.'</p><br><br><p>Soon, the supports hurriedly ran up to Viron and Gnash. It pained them to look at the grievous wounds of their captains, but all remained silent. With grave expressions, they tried to heal their wounds.</p><br><br><p>Viron gasped, a stream of thick blood gushed from his mouth, pouring down the shoes of the girl standing in front of him. She shuddered and began to heal him with redoubled efforts.</p><br><p>From the side, a caustic sneer rang out:</p><br><p>"Hah, looks like the Grim Warro attacked more than just your arm, right? I knew I couldn't get more wounds than you."</p><br><p>In response, Viron shook his head, a bitter smile forming on his face.</p><br><p>"Shut up... You just defeated a floating bubble, nothing to be proud of here."</p><br><br><p>Gnash's eyebrows rose, she crossed her arms over her chest irritably. The Essence Silent Droao was not a weak opponent, everyone knew that.</p><br><p>Then, Viron sat down on the cold floor, his hands on his knees and his gaze raised upwards.</p><br><p>"Well, good job anyway. I'm sure if Adam Vinter were here, he'd appreciate your victory a lot brighter than I."</p><br><p>Gnash's cheeks flushed for a moment as she silently looked away, her lips trembling, she mumbled something to herself.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, while Adam was slowly coming to his senses feeling the energy absorbed into his body, the bloody circle shuddered.</p><br><p>Ripple. Ripple. Ripple.</p><br><p>The surface of the pond trembled, cracks slowly passing over the statue of the headless serpent.</p><br><p>The ritual was complete.</p>
