            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1480: House on Top (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Living in the heart of the Citadel had many advantages, both global ones, such as security and infrastructure, and simple and trivial ones, like grocery shopping.</p><br><p>All the major stores in the Citadel delivered to Adam’s family’s house, from groceries to appliances and clothing.</p><br><p>If Leona and Gary wanted to, they could go to the store themselves, but if they didn’t have time, nothing prevented them from ordering delivery.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Leona headed for the gate as a buzzing sound could be heard in the distance.</p><br><br><p>He turned around to see a drone flying towards them with several boxes of groceries.</p><br><p>“Do you always do this?”</p><br><p>Leona shook her head. “Nah, maybe I’m too old, but I prefer to go to the stores myself. I mean, there’s something special about choosing your own fruits, vegetables, and groceries, seeing other people, and just walking between the aisles instead of clicking on pictures of products while sitting in front of a monitor.”</p><br><p>She took out her phone and confirmed that they had accepted the order when the drone left the boxes in front of their house.</p><br><p>“But sometimes I use delivery. I can’t deny that it’s fast and convenient. It would be silly not to take advantage of the opportunities you’ve given us.”</p><br><p>Adam was embarrassed for a moment as he smiled.</p><br><p>“Yeah, it’s a good place. There’s no doubt about that.”</p><br><p>Because Adam was completely focused on the path of evolution and spent most of his time at the Deal Lands or training, he didn’t attach much importance to things like money or status.</p><br><p>But if it weren’t for him, his parents would hardly have been able to move even to the Second Ring, let alone the very center of the First Ring.</p><br><p>They were simple people, without careers, money, power, or connections. Leona, Gary, and Trici were very lucky that someone in their family turned out to be a Phantom, especially one as strong as Adam.</p><br><br><p>Adam picked up the boxes from the ground as he saw various fruits through the gaps—peaches, pears, and oranges.</p><br><p>“Are you going to use all of this for a pie?”</p><br><br><p>“Yep, but I’m not just planning on making a pie! How about some crispy buns and eclairs with delicate cream? You know, when you don’t have any problems, especially financial ones, you have a surprising amount of free time. I’ve always loved to cook, so why not do it now?”</p><br><p>“Hah, I guess you’re right.” Adam nodded. “By the way, you and your father are doing well, right?”</p><br><p>Leona’s corners of her lips turned upward as she ruffled his hair.</p><br><p>“Of course! We went through the slums together and raised two wonderful children! You could say that we are now in our retirement, an early one.”</p><br><br><p>“I see. I’m happy for you.”</p><br><p>He wanted to keep the world as it was, including his family. The fact that things were going well for others was an added motivation for him.</p><br><p>Whether everything would stay that way or not depended entirely on him.</p><br><br><p>A few hours later, closer to late afternoon, when Adam had already eaten two pies and several éclairs, several messages came to his phone.</p><br><p>[Silvana: Hey, I decided to write here instead of using our connection, well… you know. If you’re free, we can look at some suitable options today.]</p><br><p>Adam glanced around the kitchen at Trici, who was struggling to stuff another piece of pie into her mouth, and at Leona and Gary, who were washing dishes together and talking about something.</p><br><p>‘It’s time to do the last thing, right?’ He thought and replied to Silvana.</p><br><p>He would still have plenty of time to spend with his family and Silvana, just like in the Citadel. But if he needed to move on, to return to the Dead Lands, he had to be sure he had done everything important.</p><br><p>Obviously, buying a house for him and Silvana was the last item on that list.</p><br><br><p>Like a normal person, Adam called a taxi. Soon, a black car was in front of the gate of the house as Adam drove towards the skyscrapers.</p><br><p>This area and the skyscrapers were both considered the center of the First Ring, but one was a public area where, in addition to houses, there were businesses, offices, and restaurants, and the other was a private sector for wealthy people and members of the government.</p><br><p>In just a few minutes, his car stopped in front of the first skyscraper on their list. Silvana was already waiting for him near the entrance.</p><br><p>Next to her was a middle-aged woman with a tablet in her hands. She was dressed in standard office attire, her hair was blonde and styled in a tight bun, and her green eyes stared intently through thin-rimmed glasses.</p><br><p>Obviously, this was his real estate agent. Her job was to show them and tell them about each suitable option, the price, the features of a particular apartment, and also to take care of all the paperwork.</p><br><p>“Hi, looks like everything’s ready?” Adam waved his hand when the woman held out her hand.</p><br><p>“I’m glad to meet you, Adam Vinter. I’ve heard a lot about you, and I’m flattered that I’ll be the one to help you choose your future home.”</p><br><p>Adam touched the back of his neck.</p><br><p>“Hah, I don’t know if we’ll buy anything today, but if we find the perfect option, I’m not against it.”</p><br><p>The woman smiled. She was confident that she would close a big deal today.</p><br><p>“We have several skyscrapers ahead of us. When you see the options that Silvana and I have prepared for you, you won’t be able to refuse!”</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Silvana, who nodded slightly. She had found some of the apartments on their list herself, but their real estate agent had recommended a few.</p><br><p>They headed toward the entrance as Adam looked up.</p><br><p>They were surrounded by numerous skyscrapers, all of them tall and majestic structures made of concrete, steel, and glass, ranging from 80 to 120 stories each. The choice was enormous.</p>
