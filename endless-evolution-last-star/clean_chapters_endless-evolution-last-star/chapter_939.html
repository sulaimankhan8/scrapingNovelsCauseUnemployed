            <br><p>The older and stronger a person got, the harder it was to impress them. It always worked that way, because seeing something for the first time made a person feel much more emotional than when the same event happened for the hundredth time.</p><br><p>Orel was no exception to this rule. He was not an old man, but not as young as Adam or Risha. He was much older than MIsa or Silvana.</p><br><p>But, what was more important was not his age but the fact that he was a K4-Phantom. He saw a lot of things on his way to this level, but now his eyes were wide open in genuine delight.</p><br><p>With slight disbelief, he looked at his NEP like a watch.</p><br><p>"Three minutes...? Hey, did you guys decide to play a joke on me? There's no way you mastered the shared voice so quickly. I haven't seen that yet."</p><br><p>Silvana raised an eyebrow, looking at him baffled. "Mr. Orel, we have been using the shared sight for a long time, we can do it easily and at any time. The shared voice is a different ability, sure, but they're pretty similar since they perform pretty much the same function."</p><br><p>"Well..." Adam scratched his cheek awkwardly. "I think Orel is right to some extent."</p><br><br><p>They both looked at him with interest.</p><br><p>"I could be wrong, but the key to us being able to communicate mentally is how strong our bond is, between my Evolution Tree and Silvana's Evolution Sprout.</p><br><p>"I don't want to go into too much detail, but recently I've had a lot of time to figure out my inner space and how energy works."</p><br><p>For Orel, it didn't provide any answers, but it caused Silvana to ponder.</p><br><p>'I see... I guess Adam is talking about the years spent in Queen Elisa's space.'</p><br><p>Then, Orel waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Alright, it's not that important. You will now be able to speak to each other without headphones, microphones, or other devices. It's done."</p><br><p>Adam raised his hand, pointing to his black NEP. "Does that mean this thing is useless?"</p><br><p>"Hah... I wouldn't say that," Orel smirked, a gleam running across his eyes. "When you're a K3-Phantom, the NEP does lose most of its meaning as a device, but it's an important mark showing the common people that you're a Phantom and others what organization you're from."</p><br><p>With that, Orel, Silvana, and Adam walked out of the Red Tower meeting Risha and Misa waiting for them at the entrance.</p><br><p>"Hm? Did something go wrong? You better hurry up and learn how to use the shared voice!" Risha exclaimed grudgingly pointing at Adam.</p><br><br><p>Orel patted her on the head with a mocking smile.</p><br><p>"No need to be so cocky, we're done here. Turns out my help wasn't needed."</p><br><br><p>Before Risha could object, Orel clapped his hands together drawing attention to himself.</p><br><p>"Good, Risha and Adam will head to the gate, she'll guide Adam where they need to go and they'll go down together at the Red Zone," he turned to the girls. "Misa, for the first time you will take Silvana to your room. Let her use your computer, in the meantime teach her how to use our database and stuff."</p><br><br><p>Immediately, Misa nodded and took Silvana's hand. Oddly enough, Silvana didn't turn around to say goodbye to Adam, instead, she closed her eyes, focusing.</p><br><p>'Good luck. This will be your first battle against monsters since defeating the Crimson Monarch,' she mentally uttered.</p><br><br><p>'Yeah... Considering how things are set up at the Cave Grid, it's no different than coming back to the Dead Lands. Monsters, Phantoms, and anomalies, everything you need.'</p><br><p>Orel patted Risha and Adam on the back, guiding them forward.</p><br><p>"Come on, it's time to kill some monsters and at least one S4," he smirked pointing to a gate in the distance. Obviously, they would get through the Red Bears part easily.</p><br><p>"Wait," Adam glanced at him over his shoulder. "The Red Zone, like any other zone, is divided into floors, isn't it? Which one do I need to go to? Where do I find the S4 monster?"</p><br><p>"I don't know," Orel shrugged. "Those are questions for your Operator and Risha, maybe for her Operator."</p><br><p>In a quiet stride, Orel headed towards the tower, keeping his hands in his pockets. He stopped in the middle of the entrance, looking down the long passageway.</p><br><p>"You must realize that I'm not making you kill an S4 monster because I need to. I can easily kill any Red Threat monster, it's past level for me. I gave you this mission because you need it in the first place.</p><br><p>"Only by getting a reputation and making a name for yourself here at the Lower Ring, I can justify to the other captains why I should help you. But, that's not the only way killing the S4 monster could be useful to you."</p><br><p>"Agh? What are you talking about?" Adam frowned heavily.</p><br><p>Orel folded his hands behind his back, staring into the void. "It's simple. The Four Beasts are constantly competing with each other, like every company in the world. Obviously, recruiting new members is one of the things. A free K3-Phantom capable of killing an S3 monster from the first descent at the Cave Grid?</p><br><p>"Hah, after you do that my head or the other captains will demand that I recruit you. Apparently, others from the Four Beasts will try to do the same. Perhaps the Black Swan themselves will decide to contact you. I don't know for sure, but it's possible. It all depends on you."</p><br><p>Adam clenched his fist tightly, his gaze thoughtful.</p><br><p>"So... You're telling me that my chances are based on how tough a monster I take down? Sounds fair enough."</p><br><p>"Hah, defeating strong monsters is prized everywhere, not just at the Lower Ring, but the Cave Grid brings everyone together. What one did is known to everybody."</p><br><p>Orel said nothing more, he stepped forward gradually disappearing into the shadows.</p><br><p>Then, Risha and Adam looked at each other.</p><br><p>She put her hands at her sides, glaring at him unhappily. "My brother expects a lot from you. I hope what you showed in the junkyard isn't the limit of your strength, or else an S4 monster will tear you apart and my brother just wasted his time on you!"</p><br><p>Risha tugged on his arm, heading towards the massive gate in the distance.</p><br><p>Then, in Adam's head came Silvana's calm voice. She could see everything and hear everything thanks to shared sight.</p><br><p>'She seems to genuinely love her big brother. Hah, like any little sister would. But... something is bothering me...'</p><br><p>'Hmm? What are you talking about?' Adam asked following Risha's lead.</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip. 'Orel said that recently she had trouble in a battle against an S3 monster. I'm sure S3 and even more so S4 monsters are serious opponents, but... now she'll be your partner. I'm worried that she's too weak and will be a burden for you.'</p><br><p>A short laugh with a hint of darkness escaped from Adam.</p><br><p>'Hah, you sound cruel, but you don't have to worry about that.'</p><br><br><p>Adam's corners of his mouth went up, looking at Risha who was walking ahead.</p><br><p>'She lost in our fight, sure, but calling her weak you're badly mistaken. I mean, I defeated Reinz, who was the strongest at the Twilight Palace among the K3 high nobles. Sure, everyone, there was a novice like me, but...</p><br><p>'I don't want to be arrogant, but it shows that I'm a dangerous foe. Risha is strong, she would easily be in the Top 5 of the Twilight Palace.'</p><br><p>The shock was reflected on Silvana's face, her lips trembling.</p><br><p>'W-What...? Adam, that's a very high grade. Are you sure about that? You beat her in one minute...'</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply approaching the walls.</p><br><p>'Absolutely. And, I think Risha is no exception. I mean, as we found out, 99% of the Phantoms here are the Natural Phantoms. However, I believe that's not why Risha and the others are strong. The conditions that make them strong forced them to become the Natural Phantoms.'</p><br><br><p>'Ghm. Life at the Lower Ring is fast-paced, they become Phantoms early and fight constantly. This extends to ordinary people as well. I think that at the Lower Ring, the competition for a top position is much higher than at the Upper Ring.'</p><br><p>After a long pause, Silvana sighed. She and Misa got off the elevator heading towards Misa's apartment.</p><br><p>'I see... In that case, I hope you're right. Remember that you are now a Dark Phantom that you once fought against.'</p><br><p>With unusual ease, Adam shrugged.</p><br><p>'Hah, that's manipulation. They were my enemies not because they're the Dark Phantoms and I'm a Light Phantom, but because they attacked us and killed my mates.'</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam's eyes turned dark, full of gloom.</p><br><p>'I would have done the same thing to the Phantoms from the Upper Ring. We have the government and the military to thank for that. No matter the means, they got it done. The Phantoms from the Upper Ring compete, but they all consider each other allies - working towards a common goal.'</p><br><p>Then, Silvana stopped maintaining the shared voice, and with fire in her eyes, she approached Misa, ready to learn.</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam and Risha reached the walls.</p><br><p>"You wait here. I'll explain everything to them," Risha waved her hand heading towards the guards.</p><br><p>"Sure..." Adam muttered raising his gaze.</p><br><p>The men in dark red uniforms stared at him intently. They saw him as an outsider.</p><br><p>'I wonder what's better - a fake smile or such an unpleasant but honest stare?'</p>
