            <br><p>There were millions of people living in the Citadel, globally all of these people could be divided into two categories, Phantoms and Non-Phantoms.</p><br><p>This was much more important than a person's gender, race, occupation, age, appearance, and financial status.</p><br><p>Everything else depended on whether a person was a Phantom or not. Sure, there were hundreds of roles in the Citadel, as well as levels of status, influence, and income. Each had their life and tasks.</p><br><p>But, only Phantoms were capable of fighting monsters, and killing monsters was the only way to keep humanity alive.</p><br><p>The Phantoms were not weapons or robots in the literal sense of the words. They possessed superpowers, both energetic and physical, but they were still humans.</p><br><p>They knew how to rejoice or feel sadness, to worry or remain calm, to get angry or go into unbridled rage, and of course - Phantoms knew how to love.</p><br><p>There were certain unspoken rules about who the Phantoms should be in a relationship with and marry, but... no one could forbid the Phantoms to be in a relationship with their Operator or marry someone from the slums.</p><br><p>Sure, they weren't the most common cases, but they did happen, though they were reviled by society on all sides.</p><br><p>It seemed that if two Phantoms married each other, it was the perfect scenario, but... not always.</p><br><p>It required a better understanding of what was going on in the First Ring, how the Wings were structured as well as... How was Osana related to that?</p><br><br><p>Adam followed Osana, who had been silent for several minutes. They were just walking through the park, passing dozens of people.</p><br><p>From time to time, Adam glanced at the ring on his finger, not believing what just happened. The ring was silver and quite thin, covered with exquisite engraving. Adam didn't know why, but he felt like this ring was worth a lot more than he imagined.</p><br><p>He recently broke up with Jena, not that he thought it was a serious relationship, but still at one point he gave it a try and didn't reject Jena.</p><br><p>Jena had the same opinion about that situation as Adam did, so there were no problems or offenses between them.</p><br><p>But... if Adam sometimes thought about relationships, he definitely didn't think about getting married and being someone's husband.</p><br><p>He thought that if it was ever going to happen, it would be when he was old enough, experienced, and most importantly found the right partner, in Adam's opinion that was the hardest task of all.</p><br><p>Now he was going to marry Osana, but he wasn't thinking about that. First, Adam wanted answers to his questions.</p><br><p>"Hey Adam, let's go to that cafe over there!" Osana said with a bright smile on her face, pointing to a small cafe at the corner of the street, outside the park.</p><br><p>She acted like the most normal girl who was taking an evening stroll through the park with her boyfriend, as many people around them did.</p><br><p>Adam nodded silently, a hope showing in his gaze that this time Osana wouldn't leave him without answers.</p><br><p>Walking into the cafe, Osana smiled and headed forward. She chose this place not because she liked the facade or the signboard, but because it was perfect for her purposes.</p><br><p>This cafe had a strict, Asian style in both menu and decoration.</p><br><p>Paper lamps, a few trees growing right in the main hall, and heavy use of redwood for the walls and doors.</p><br><p>But, the most important thing was that this was not a standard cafe where people came in, sat down at a table, and chose what they wanted to eat from the menu, while waiting for their order visitors could enjoy the atmosphere and look around, meeting other people's eyes.</p><br><p>In this cafe, everything was divided into many chambers, for one person, for two, for three, and so on.</p><br><p>This was done so that the customers could have a quiet place to enjoy either solitude or socializing with each other.</p><br><p>However, some people might have used this feature for another purpose as well - anonymity.</p><br><br><p>The doors closed when Osana and Adam found themselves in the two-person chamber. Inside there were two padded seats and a large wooden table.</p><br><p>On the table was the standard set of any cafe or restaurant - napkins, a menu, a spice set, and something unusual - a bronze bell.</p><br><p>"Looks like this isn't the first time you've been here, does it?" Adam suggested, watching Osana's confident actions.</p><br><p>Osana smirked, sitting down at the table and taking the menu in her hands. Read new chapters at empire</p><br><p>"What makes you think that?" Osana asked ironically.</p><br><p>Adam rolled his eyes and sat down across from her, resting his shoulder against the wall.</p><br><p>Osana puffed up her cheeks demonstratively as if she was displeased about something.</p><br><p>"Hey, don't you want to sit next to your future wife?"</p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily, unable to comment on that anymore.</p><br><p>Then, before Adam could say anything, Osana rang the bell.</p><br><p>Less than a minute later a waiter came to them - a young girl in a long traditional oriental dress.</p><br><p>Osana ordered many items as if she had done so many times before. The girl was a little surprised by her large order, but soon she nodded and left.</p><br><br><p>Osana didn't say anything and neither did Adam, he just decided to wait for Osana to move into action.</p><br><p>Ten minutes later their order was ready. The food at this place was always served quickly.</p><br><br><p>The girl put the last plate on the table, which was completely filled with different food, from soups and salads to main meat and fish dishes, as well as desserts and drinks.</p><br><p>Was this food enough for a group of six or even eight people to be completely satiated or... was it more suitable for a very long and serious conversation?</p><br><p>"Enjoy your meal. If you need me, ring the bell again."</p><br><p>The girl said respectfully, bowed low, and walked away, leaving the two of them alone, in complete silence. No one would disturb them until they wanted to do so themselves.</p><br><p>"Agh, I can finally get this off." Osana breathed a sigh of relief before throwing off her cap, removing her glasses, and untying her long, luxurious pink hair.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow slightly, it seemed to him as though Osana waited a long time for this very moment - when she could take off her disguise.</p><br><p>Now, there was only one thing left to find out - Why was she doing this?</p><br><p>"Adam, I'm sorry, but I think we should introduce ourselves to each other again." Osana said with a sly smile on her face.</p><br><p>"Hmm? You mean like we don't know each other? Like your name and so on?" Adam suggested he was slightly confused.</p><br><p>"Yeah, just do it, please." Osana nodded.</p><br><p>Adam scratched his cheek. It seemed odd to him, but he didn't bother to deny Osana her request. In fact, if it meant she would finally explain her actions, then he was willing to say and do anything.</p><br><p>Well... it had already played tricks on him once.</p><br><p>Adam extended his hand forward.</p><br><p>"Hi, my name is Adam Vinter, I'm the Phantom."</p><br><p>Osana chuckled as she looked away.</p><br><p>"How sincere and simple. I'm even a little jealous."</p><br><p>Adam gave her a baffled look.</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, Osana responded to his handshake and spoke majestically.</p><br><p>"It's a pleasure to meet you Adam Vinter. My name is Osana De Rouzet. I am the youngest daughter of the Rouzet Family, one of the twelve most powerful noble families in the First Ring!"</p>
