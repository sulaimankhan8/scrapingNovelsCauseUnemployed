            <br><p>Her fingertips trembled, a chill ran down her spine as Katrin’s teeth chattered in fear and disbelief. She, like all the other Phantoms in the fortress, knew well what the One-Eyed Serpent Archers’ arrows were capable of.
</p><br><p>It was a shot with enough force to wipe out an entire squad and a dozen monsters hundreds of meters away.
</p><br><p>Yet, four arrows of equal power couldn’t come close to the Dormant Lord, simply because his energy reserves were terrifying.
</p><br><p>Twitch. Twitch. Twitch.
</p><br><p>The crystal grid covering his entire body was shaking vigorously, his aura was rapidly becoming weaker, the Dormant Lord was expending more energy per second than most normal monsters that came in waves had.
</p><br><p>There was no weakness in his posture, only an unwavering confidence that his strength was enough to stop a deadly attack.
</p><br><br><p>The Dormant Lord abruptly turned around, slightly widening the disk, so the density was reduced and the four arrows were able to move forward slightly.
</p><br><p>With a second of uncertainty, the Dormant Lord stretched his arms forward, clutching the arrows together. The purple energy tried to explode to destroy the Dormant Lord’s hands and himself, but the pressure prevented that from happening.
</p><br><p>Then, the crystal grid trembled again, but this time much more actively, while the Dormant Lord’s hands slowly clenched, the energy came out of the arrows in chunks, going straight into the monster’s hands.
</p><br><p>The purple clots swept through his arms along his entire body trying to inflict damage, but the crystal grid successfully absorbed each of them.
</p><br><p>After only a few breaths, the Dormant Lord lowered his arms and dispelled the white disk, all four arrows were devoured.
</p><br><p>Katrin gulped, her mind overtaken by panic trying to realize what just happened and what demon she decided to go up against in mortal combat.
</p><br><p>’No fucking way... His aura... it’s almost the same as before the attack... Considering the absorbed arrows, it only took a little energy to stop our best attack...’
</p><br><p>But, she didn’t have much time to think.
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a long arm covered in light appeared in front of her, about to fall on her face.
</p><br><p>Katrin’s pupils dilated as she ducked sharply, forcibly returning to the previous pace of their fight.
</p><br><p>"Alan, when’s the next time the archers can attack?!"
</p><br><p>She exclaimed blocking the next blows. Then, the Dormant Lord’s fist plunged into her stomach throwing her back dozens of meters.
</p><br><p>Whoooooooooooooooooooosh.
</p><br><p>Before Katrin could reach the ground, the Dormant Lord leaped forward, quickly catching up to her while she was still in flight.
</p><br><p>Katrin turned her head to the left, staring in disbelief at the silhouette overtaking her.
</p><br><br><p>Realizing from Alan’s delay that soon the archers wouldn’t be able to help her, Katrin crossed her swords in front of her, she prepared to fight to the last drop of blood, no one could stop the Dormant Lord but her.
</p><br><p>Soon, the consternation in her eyes changed to certainty, she accepted her situation.
</p><br><p>’Fine... I wanted this for myself. To get stronger, to get better you have to fight without fear of death, and... that’s the most important thing.’
</p><br><p>For a moment, dozens of silhouettes of Phantoms appeared in Katrin’s mind, frightened and wounded, running towards the fortress and those already hidden behind the high walls.
</p><br><p>’I must protect them, there is no one stronger than me here, and so it is my duty...’
</p><br><p>Then, the white and black flashes continued their clashes, raising waves of sand, leaving craters on the ground and long cuts that failed to reach their target.
</p><br><p>The phantoms were worried, panic was brewing among some, while the monsters realized that a good outcome for them was closer than ever.
</p><br><p>The One-Eyed Serpent Archers were in a special situation, one of them, on the northwestern tower was watching the battle intently, seeing all their movements, but not knowing what to do.
</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, something touched his shoulder, sending a wave of shivers through the archer’s long body. The towers were constantly protected by the barrier, and the archers had superior vision and instinct.
</p><br><p>If someone was able to stealthily approach them from behind, it meant no good to them.
</p><br><p>Without making any sudden movements, the archer slowly turned around as his large purple eyes opened wide and his vertical pupil quivered in disbelief.
</p><br><p>Behind him stood the Blind Commander, his hand resting on the archer’s broad shoulder while the last drops of blood trickled leisurely down his fingertips. Discover exclusive content at NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>The One-Eyed Serpent Archer didn’t know what to do, never before had any of the Commanders climbed the towers, and... he thought that the Blind Commander was dead, killed in action against the first Phantom to enter through the gate.
</p><br><p>Yet, the Blind Commander was here, watching the crucial battle through the tight bandages around his head, covered in blood and torn from old age.
</p><br><br><p>The Blind Commander patted the archer on the shoulder and stepped forward. He watched the fight from a best vantage point for a while, taking in every movement of the two warriors.
</p><br><p>The archer glanced over to the other three, but they were even more baffled than he was. In the hierarchy of the fortress, the Commanders were higher than them, especially the strongest of the three.
</p><br><p>Then, the Blind Commander shook his head, he sighed disappointedly:
</p><br><br><p>The single grunt and gesture expressed his entire opinion of the battle. He realized that soon one of the fighters would lose, their strength was not equal, their instincts and power were on different levels as well as something deeper...
</p><br><br><p>Turning around, the Blind Commander patted the archer on the shoulder once more before turning into a shadow disappearing in an unknown direction.
</p><br><p>Trying to find out what the last commander was about to do, the archer looked around, only after a few seconds managing to find the Blind Commander at the foot of the spire.
</p><br><p>Yet, soon his silhouette trembled, disappearing and reappearing at one point and another, soon the archer lost sight of him, forcing himself back to watching the battle.
</p><br><br><p>With slow, heavy steps, the Blind Commander walked along the stair, struggling to climb to the top of the spire.
</p><br><p>Bright blue flames billowing from the center brightened him, but... that wasn’t what caught his attention.
</p><br><br><p>Tilting his head, the Blind Commander stared at the hilt of the sword left there by Adam.
</p><br><p>"Gha... ha... ha... ha..."
</p><br><p>The Blind Commander let out a short wheeze similar to laughter, walking towards his target.
</p><br><p>Someone had to protect the fortress.
</p><br><p>If the strongest Phantom couldn’t, then the strongest monster had to do it.</p>
