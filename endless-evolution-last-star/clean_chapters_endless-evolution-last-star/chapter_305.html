            <br><p>When using significant resources to kill an enemy, destroying an entire volcano, and causing a tremor spreading hundreds of meters, the last thing anyone expects is for their enemy to somehow survive it.</p><br><p>"Shit... Is this really happening?" Katrin frowned looking at the tall silhouette hiding behind thick streams of steam.</p><br><p>With each passing second as the steam slowly dissipated, the tension between their squad was rapidly increasing.</p><br><p>Lero and Erla looked especially anxious. Their main nightmare was the battle against the evolved Prime Thunder Demon, for they didn't even know how strong such a monster was, but they definitely knew that it was not their level.</p><br><p>Adam spotted the silhouette behind the steam first.</p><br><p>He should have acted, quickly thought of a plan, contacted Silvana, or done something to prevent the monster from attacking.</p><br><p>Read latest stories on mvl</p><br><p>But... instead, Adam only smiled slightly.</p><br><p>Fighting against Essence Thunder Demon, his strongest opponent at the moment, Adam had memorized what the monster must look like. Every detail that mattered was imprinted in his memory.</p><br><p>So... staring at the silhouette of the monster hidden by the flow of steam for a few seconds, Adam understood everything and came to a clear conclusion.</p><br><br><p>Prime Thunder Demon slowly stepped forward stepping out of the veil of steam, revealing himself to the Phantoms.</p><br><p>Erla's eyes went wide as a slight shiver went down her body.</p><br><p>Prime Thunder Demon still looked formidable, but... he was defeated. He was missing half of his body, his right paw, his right leg, and most of his tail were gone. The monster could barely stand on his only leg.</p><br><p>Most of his body was badly burned, not even the hundreds of protective black scales that should have minimized any damage. Only a small part remained intact, but it was only the outer flesh, while everything inside was critically damaged.</p><br><p>The larva king was gone, either Thunder Demon had already eaten it, or the hail attack had destroyed it. Either way, Thunder Demon was not destined to evolve.</p><br><p>Adam was sure that Prime Thunder Demon had lost not because the monster was badly injured, but because there was no flame of life in his gaze.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon just looked away with an almost blank stare and sighed heavily from time to time. He was like an engine running out of fuel, so... a few sighs were the best he could hope for.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>Adam tore forward without using his artifact. He had used too much energy already. However, Katrin and Osana's reinforcements were still on him, so he moved quickly.</p><br><p>"What...? Is he going to finish him off?" Erla muttered, slightly puzzled. She followed Adam's movements closely, but something soon confused her.</p><br><p>Adam wasn't using a single ability and as soon as the distance between him and Thunder Demon was reduced to ten meters, Adam stopped.</p><br><p>He could only step on the path of massive rocks that divided the lava lake. However, Thunder Demon was standing on the same path, so the hot lava was nothing more than decoration at the moment.</p><br><p>"Well, well, in some ways, you're kind of like a human, aren't you?" Adam said with a slight smirk as if looking at an old friend.</p><br><p>Sure, he had only met this Thunder Demon today, but the memories of the battle against Essence Thunder Demon had already become a thing of the past and passed through a prism of nostalgia.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, this was a frequent occurrence. As long as a conflict or battle with an enemy was not completed, then both participants would feel either a belligerent spirit or anger and hatred.</p><br><p>However, once their story came to an end with one of them losing, all previous feelings were gradually replaced by thoughts of the glorious past.</p><br><p>The hated foe became a worthy opponent from the past who could only be met with a bitter smile since they both shared the difficult fate of facing each other.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon said nothing, he just glanced at Adam before waving his remaining paw, not to attack but to show that none of this mattered anymore.</p><br><p>Adam stood still, not taking a single step.</p><br><p>With each new flow of wind Thunder Demon took one breath at a time, but soon... there was only the whistle of the wind without a breath.</p><br><br><p>The Thunder Demon fell to the ground in front of Adam's feet with a rumble.</p><br><p>Adam just stared at the defeated monster while his gaze grew deeper.</p><br><p>'You're not going to take the trophy?' Silvana asked knowing Adam's habits.</p><br><p>Adam leaned over to Thunder Demon, examining the body of the already dead monster.</p><br><p>"Well, though I landed one of the main attacks I don't have the full feeling that I was the one who killed him. Trophy? Nah, that's not the case, though... I might take a souvenir as a keepsake." Adam muttered before ripping off one surviving black scale from Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>Adam looked at the scale, which reflected the lights and bursts of lava around them. Then, with a bitter smile, Adam slipped the scale into his pocket, making this thing the next thing in his collection.</p><br><p>Oskar, Erla, and the others glanced over before approaching Adam.</p><br><p>"What do we do next?" Lero muttered with slight trepidation.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon had died, but Lero was still wary.</p><br><p>Adam cast a glance at Katrin.</p><br><p>"We will stay here and continue our mission. After all, we have to finish the hunt for the Scarlet Pyromancer. It's a dangerous monster, but given our power level we'll be able to handle it." Adam said confidently.</p><br><p>Katrin said nothing, she only nodded with a sharp look.</p><br><p>Lero nodded as he looked at Katrin.</p><br><p>"In that case, I wish you good luck. It was a great mission together. I hope we get to work together again!" Lero said vigorously.</p><br><p>Katrin glared at him and snorted irritably. She regarded people like Lero as annoying and interfering.</p><br><p>"No. That's out of the question." Oskar said sternly before stepping forward, picking up Thunder Demon, and carrying the monster's body to the ground, away from the lava.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Oskar, what are you talking about?" Erla asked baffled.</p><br><p>Oskar looked around before stopping his gaze on Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>"Without Adam and Katrin, there would have been a real disaster. We'd probably be dead by now and the evolved Thunder Demon would have killed many other squads before help arrived from the Citadel. We must help them in their mission to make things fair." Oskar said with determination in his gaze.</p><br><p>Adam and Katrin looked at each other. Now they wanted to get rid of Golden Light Squad even more.</p><br><p>In fact, Adam and Katrin didn't need their help, moreover, the hunt for Scarlet Pyromancer needed only the two of them to succeed.</p><br><p>"Damn, you don't understand..." Katrin muttered before moving on to explain.</p><br><p>After a few moments, Oskar nodded understandingly.</p><br><p>"I see... So the change of the Initial Gene, it all makes sense now. Well, we want to rest before we move on anyway."</p><br><p>Katrin tilted her head in confusion.</p><br><p>"Wait... Does that mean you're not leaving? I've already explained everything. Your interference in the fight just jeopardizes my goal." Katrin frowned heavily.</p><br><p>Oskar smiled broadly poking himself in the chest with a finger.</p><br><p>"Don't worry. We won't interfere in the fight. We'll kill the monsters around you so they won't bother you. Moreover, this way we'll gather more resources and the Harvesters can come here!"</p><br><p>Katrin clenched her staff tightly and sparks seemed to come from her gritted teeth. She was ready to lunge at Oskar and beat him to a pulp.</p>
