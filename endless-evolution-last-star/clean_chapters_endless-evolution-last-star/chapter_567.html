            <br><p>The small, old room was lit only by a single lamp with its dim light.</p><br><p>Fromund sat in an old armchair, torn in many places, but the chair was in decent condition, covered in stitches since Elva, Liv, and Tilda took care to make it look at least somewhat decent.</p><br><p>Across from him, on three wooden chairs as old as his armchair, sat Zarot, Mariel, and Nirosh, eager to get down to business as soon as possible.</p><br><p>Zarot glanced at his watch - 2.15 A.M. They had less than one hour left to announce their fighter. Moreover, in two hours they should already be in the Moon Colosseum for the fight to begin.</p><br><p>If Fromund stalls or refuses, the Marzo Family will be left with only one choice - to select as a fighter anyone who showed any performance from the examiners who are still working and fighting against the candidates.</p><br><p>"So... Speak up, why did you come here and what do you want?" Fromund nonchalantly asked while looking at them with a deep gaze.</p><br><p>He would be ready for some serious talk since Elva, Liv, and Tilda went to sleep and they wouldn't hear anything they shouldn't know.</p><br><p>Well, at least that's what Fromund thought.</p><br><br><p>Slowly, so as not to make a single sound, Elva, Liv, and Tilda walked out of their rooms. They purposely didn't lock the doors since they knew they weren't going to go to bed this early.</p><br><p>Well, it was late, especially for teenagers like them, but their energy and curiosity wouldn't allow them to fall asleep in such a situation.</p><br><p>Fromund wasn't a very strict brother, so he didn't force his younger sisters to go to bed at a certain time like other parents might do. He didn't want to limit their freedom, and it was also good for them to learn the consequences of a situation where they needed to get up early and they went to bed late.</p><br><p>"Ghm." Zarot coughed as he pointed at Nirosh and began the story, "It is related to the wedding and The Rule of Power."</p><br><p>"The Rule of Power...?" Formund raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><br><p>Zarot and Mariel spent the next ten minutes explaining to Fromund what happened, how important the wedding between the two great families was, and what The Rule of Power was, as well as where the situation stood now.</p><br><p>They didn't try to hide too much and told it like it was, answering his questions. It was in their best interest that Fromund agreed to help them.</p><br><p>In the end, they showed him a photo of his opponent, as well as the purple room where hundreds of people were waiting for the second fighter to appear.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter..." Fromund muttered, "He's a talented and strong Phantom, defeated the Plague Reaper, and is fighting on The Rule of Power to save Osana from an unwanted wedding."</p><br><p>Fromund rested his cheek on his hand and cast a glance at Mariel before continuing to talk about the fight.</p><br><p>"Well, well, is your daughter's freedom worth less than the benefit of the wedding?"</p><br><p>Mariel bit her lip, crumpled her clothes, and glanced down.</p><br><p>"Don't say that. It's tradition and the way our society works. Most nobles, especially Light Nobles go through it, even if it's something unpleasant, it's just a part of our lives that we accept."</p><br><p>Fromund answered her nothing.</p><br><p>His gaze grew colder, slowly transferring from Mariel to Nirosh.</p><br><p>"It's not good only for your daughter, but not for him, is it?"</p><br><p>Nirosh raised his head arrogantly, his arms crossed over his chest.</p><br><p>"Will you stop treating me like a piece of shit? I did everything according to the rules. It's her fault that she's only an Artificial Phantom and I'm the Natural Phantom! Furthermore, I wouldn't act so pompous if I were you!"</p><br><p>Sensing his power and dominant position, Nirosh leaned forward, his eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>"You are only a candidate to be my fighter, you will battle for me on The Rule of Power and defeat Adam Vinter, then you will receive your reward and that will be it. Nothing else should concern you."</p><br><br><p>A formidable, with increasing heaviness, silence fell for a long time.</p><br><p>Mariel and Zarot made no move to do anything about it. Fromund and Nirosh needed to deal with it themselves. After all, Nirosh was right.</p><br><p>If Fromund agreed to fight, he would be on the side of the Marzo Family, that is, fighting for Nirosh's interests.</p><br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda squatting outside the doors with their ears against the wall frowned slightly.</p><br><p>They were girls, so they imagined themselves in Osana's shoes. None of them would want a husband like Nirosh, much less give up their freedom for a forced wedding.</p><br><br><p>Fromund rose from his chair, slowly approaching Nirosh.</p><br><br><p>Fromund said menacingly, looking Nirosh up and down.</p><br><p>Nirosh gulped. For some reason he felt fear, a shiver went through his entire body. Enjoy exclusive chapters from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>'What...? I'm afraid of him? No, that can't be! It's definitely not and I'll prove it!' Nirosh internally exclaimed before rising abruptly.</p><br><br><p>As soon as Nirosh's back straightened, Fromund's fist plunged into his stomach.</p><br><p>Nirosh's pupils narrowed in vivid pain, his mouth opened wide, for a time he couldn't breathe and spent all his strength to come to normal.</p><br><p>Then, Fromund sat Nirosh back down on the chair, clutching his shoulder tightly, with such force that his expensive clothes were ready to rip from any sudden movement.</p><br><p>"Are you saying it's Osana's fault that she's an Artificial Phantom?" Fromund's voice was filled with gloom.</p><br><p>Nirosh wanted to say something, he was outraged and angry, but as soon as he raised his head to meet Fromund's gaze, he immediately fell silent, he couldn't find the strength to utter a single word.</p><br><p>"I can sense that you and I are on the same level..." Fromund wheezed, "And... do you think we're equals?"</p><br><p>Fromund sank lower, looking directly at the startled Nirosh.</p><br><p>"I am like you a Natural Phantom, but... unlike you, this was my only chance at survival and some sort of life."</p><br><p>As if recalling the actual hell, Fromund pointed down, and he didn't mean the floor or the ground, his purpose was to remind that the Citadel had another side, different from the Upper Ring.</p><br><p>"Down there, I had no choice. I had to either become strong or die condemning my sisters to the same fate and..."</p><br><p>Fromund took a deep breath stepping back to his chair.</p><br><p>"As you can see I am here and it is you who is asking for my help."</p><br><p>Fromund threw one leg over the other, exuding a dangerous but also filled with pain and fatigue aura.</p><br><p>"So... Shall we continue our negotiations?"</p><br><p>Nirosh gulped, but there was nothing he could do but nod.</p><br><br><p>In the meantime, Adam continued to watch the night ninth wing, holding tightly to Silvana's shoulder.</p><br><p>No one was talking, everyone was just waiting, as there wasn't much time left for the Marzo Family.</p><br><p>"Hey Silvana, I have a question for you." Adam said quietly, seeming to make sure only Silvana could hear him.</p><br><p>His eyes were deep, with unknown intent.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Silvana cast a puzzled look at him.</p><br><p>"Nirosh... how strong is he?"</p><br><p>Before Silvana could say anything, Osana's voice rang out.</p><br><p>"K2W0, exactly the same level as me or you."</p><br><p>Osana said confidently.</p><br>
