            <br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide, in disbelief. Even though she was using shared sight and saw everything that Adam did, she could barely comprehend what just happened.</p><br><p>All Silvana saw was the Mighty Commander appear in front of Adam ready to crush him with his jaws, then a black flash covered in purple energy threw the huge monster nearly a hundred meters away.</p><br><p>'Wait... Damn! He planned all this from the beginning!' Silvana internally exclaimed when she realized what that incredible physical strength and purple energy was.</p><br><br><p>The Mighty Commander wasn't stupid, so he understood it even faster than Silvana, abruptly climbing out of the deep void in the wall.</p><br><br><p>With an annoyed glare, the Mighty Commander leaped forward, interrupting the powerful flow of the waterfall for a moment, finding himself on the round platform opposite Adam.</p><br><p>"Well, well, looks like you didn't turn out to be as strong as I thought, did you?" Adam smirked slyly, kneading his right hand, it was in deafening pain, radiating a familiar warmth from the strained muscles.</p><br><p>Then, Adam's expression grew more serious as he examined the Mighty Commander. His tough hide was cracked at the head, and his back was bleeding from the impact of the wall at this speed, but that was all Adam achieved with one of his two gravity blasts.</p><br><p>The Mighty Commander was irritated, this was clearly not what he had expected. Adam just hit him instead of trying to stop him.</p><br><br><p>Adam waved his hand before taking the same stance again.</p><br><p>"Did you think I was going to let you just pounce on me and tear me apart? If you want to do that, you're going to have to get through my defense."</p><br><br><p>Spreading his legs wide, Adam's eyes grew colder.</p><br><p>"But, I'm warning you, I have another equally powerful punch left, and... I've already realized that hitting you over the head doesn't make much sense. You're too tough."</p><br><p>The Mighty Commander's red eye narrowed as if pondering Adam's words.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, it didn't take more than a few seconds for the playful expression to return to the Mighty Commander's face, the flames inside him only burning stronger.</p><br><br><p>Without waiting for Adam's command to start, the Mighty Commander rushed forward, but the Mighty Commander didn't repeat his mistakes.</p><br><p>Instead of running in a straight line, the Mighty Commander galloped from side to side, surrounding Adam.</p><br><p>His speed, powerful muscles, and the accompanying darkness made it possible for residual shadows to follow the Mighty Commander like ghosts, making it difficult for Adam to track his opponent.</p><br><p>'Oh, he got serious, though he's still enjoying it. As much as I do, though.' Adam smirked inwardly.</p><br><br><p>Stone shards flung upwards, from the abrupt stop of the Mighty Commander, the platform simply couldn't withstand such pressure in one spot.</p><br><p>Choosing the best timing possible, the Mighty Commander found himself behind Adam, towering over him in the shadows, only his red bloodshot eye was visible.</p><br><p>It was much faster than in the monster's first failed attempt, the Mighty Commander launching his attack before he could even come to a complete stop.</p><br><p>So, by the time Adam would realize that the Mighty Commander was at his back, the monster's paws would've already fallen on Adam's shoulders, at least that was the Mighty Commander's plan.</p><br><br><p>Adam turned around sharply. It wasn't just fast, it was too fast, as if he did it not because he reacted in time to Mighty Commander, but because he knew that Mighty Commander would do it and acted in advance.</p><br><p>No matter what the creature's reaction was, acting in advance was always faster, because it was possible to react in literally 0 milliseconds, while even the fastest reaction required some time, even the shortest period.</p><br><br><p>The Mighty Commander sighed confusedly, looking at Adam's right eye, a bright amber glow was coming out from the depths, while hundreds of threads ran through his body, reinforcing his every movement.</p><br><br><p>The monster's heavy paw pressed down on Adam's shoulder, exerting enough pressure to break several bones in a second, but the Mighty Commander didn't have that much time.</p><br><p>"I told you, I've got one more punch. Did you really choose to ignore your enemy's warning?"</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, clenching his left fist tightly, purple waves swirling along his wrist, making the air shake like a star changing gravity around it with its greatness.</p><br><p>"This is a big mistake."</p><br><p>With the next breath, slicing through the wind currents with knuckles, Adam's fist plunged into Mighty Commander's belly.</p><br><p>The thick, rough hide tried to absorb the damage, to dissipate the momentum across the Mighty Commander's large body, yet it quickly reached its limit.</p><br><br><p>Streams of blood rushed through the open rips, the supple hide torn like a frayed piece of cloth fluttering in the wind.</p><br><p>Dark drops of blood flooded Adam's face as the last and most powerful pulse ripped through his arm.</p><br><p>The impact threw the Mighty Commander high into the air, in seconds the massive shadow traveled from the lowest point of the cave to the highest, crashing back not into the softening water flow but into the sharp stalactites hanging down and the purple crystals full of energy.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Continue reading at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>An active shudder comparable to a meteorite crashing in multiple waves swept through the cave, shaking even what was far above, be it the maze or the higher levels of the fortress.</p><br><p>The Shadow Walkers and the Dark Watchers stopped, looking around in bewilderment before directing their gazes downward.</p><br><p>They didn't know what was going on in the caves, but it wasn't normal for the fortress they were accustomed to, there was a major change coming.</p><br><br><p>Wide bursts of blood spurted from above, falling both on Adam and into the water around the circular platform, coloring it crimson.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes remained serious, he didn't allow a smile to appear.</p><br><p>'I was disappointed when I couldn't hurt the gate, but... it also works for monsters. In the Pacific Lands, any monster would easily shatter ordinary stalactites or crystals with its back, but here... in the Wild Lands.'</p><br><p>'It gave him serious wounds, I'm sure.'</p><br><p>Then, his eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>'However, a few stone spikes aren't enough to kill you, right?'</p><br><p>Two bright amber glows appeared behind the dust veil, growing brighter and brighter followed by a deafening roar.</p><br><p>"ROOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR!"</p>
