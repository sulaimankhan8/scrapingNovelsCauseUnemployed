            <br><p>As much as Tron tried to make Adam think of their training as a real fight, it didn't work.</p><br><p>Adam didn't feel any real threat from Tron, that he could die if he made even one mistake, and that he should watch everything going on around him, every moment.</p><br><p>This feeling surrounded him constantly when he was in Dead Lands, especially during battles against powerful monsters. Then, everything stopped mattering except winning.</p><br><p>However... even though it sounded like a big lack of training, it couldn't be called something bad.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Adam and Tron traded attacks, his needle raining down on Tron's glass blade time after time, causing sharp shards to fly off to the sides.</p><br><p>Twenty days had passed since their first battle and that was how many days remained before the wedding was to begin.</p><br><p>So Adam only had three weeks left of his training, two months were already behind him and The Rule of Power was coming.</p><br><p>During this time, Osana contacted with Adam several times to see how his training was progressing.</p><br><p>Adam's answers were always short and rather dry. He was fully immersed in the process, after all, it was now not only about Osana but also about him.</p><br><p>His training was going to last three months, which was about the same amount of time he was a Phantom before the training began.</p><br><p>'After spending so much time and effort, I couldn't lose, especially when I made a promise that I would win!' Adam inwardly spoke up, casting two silver threads on Tron.</p><br><p>One of his completely new abilities after becoming a K2-Phantom, was Silver Threads, an ability of his Initial Gene.</p><br><p>Adam could create up to fifty Silver Threads, but if he dared to use them all at once, it was always a total failure.</p><br><p>He realized this when he fought against Damien and used this ability for the first time.</p><br><p>But, Adam was not going to give up such a unique and useful ability, although really difficult to control.</p><br><p>First, he started with a single silver thread, a dense and solid made of fifty threads. Yesterday, after more than two months of training, he moved on to two threads.</p><br><p>Adam used the threads as whips, allowing him to make long-range, unexpected attacks from different angles.</p><br><br><p>Tron's eyes went wide for a moment as he jerked sharply to the side, dodging the two threads that tended to blow his head off.</p><br><p>Adam was under the effects of his Second Order - Fallen Weaver's Gaze, the threads traveled down his body, reaching his eyes, his right eye had an amber grid in it, making his vision precise and sharp.</p><br><p>So Adam could handle controlling the two threads if he used simple moves, but they were still dangerous even for Tron.</p><br><p>Sure, if Tron was at K3-Level, he hardly had anything to worry about, but the situation was different now. It was his decision to lower his strength to K2-Level which he took some time to do.</p><br><br><p>With a quick sweep of his hand, Tron knocked off one of the threads. The second thread flew over his shoulder, collapsing the tip against the ground.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..." Adam was breathing heavily while the threads were quickly returning to his arms.</p><br><p>They had exchanged attacks for several minutes now, Tron wasn't trying to attack, he was just blocking, watching how much more dangerous Adam's attacks had become over the last three weeks.</p><br><p>"Not bad, not bad at all. Your ability is difficult, but you're clearly making progress." Tron gave his assessment with a deep nod.</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly as the rings disappeared, scattering into white energy particles. Using the Silver Threads was taking too much energy from him, in some ways it was similar to the ability of his Elemental Root.</p><br><p>Wiping the sweat from his forehead, Adam stretched his shoulders and looked at Tron, the challenge visible in his gaze.</p><br><p>"Hey, use that thing you did a week ago. I want to see it again. I think I can hold out a little longer." Adam waved his hand nonchalantly as if he was talking about some game.</p><br><br><p>"Are you sure? Even if I'm K2-Level right now, the difference between our powers is too great. If you're careless, you'll get very serious wounds and even Dahla will take a long time to heal you."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged with a weak smile.</p><br><p>"Come on. I'm not weak enough to set myself up right away. I realize you won't be fighting against me at full strength, but at least I want to see your Second Order again!"</p><br><p>His words were full of confidence and desire, and his blue eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>That caught Tron's eye.</p><br><p>"Fine." Tron nodded as he cast a hard glance at Dahla, "Watch carefully. I don't want us to go off plan because of a random wound."</p><br><p>Dahla only snorted grudgingly. Her whole appearance showed that if need be, she would get Adam out even from the underworld.</p><br><p>Tron took a deep breath before reaching his hand forward. His blade was no longer needed as it was his Second Order's turn.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Cracks traveled down the blade, causing it to shatter into many shards. Then, purple energy began to flow out of Tron's hands, transforming into a multitude of streams as if made up of a million sharp blades. Explore more stories with empire</p><br><br><p>The energy streams along with the shards swirled around Tron like a vortex. Quickly, the energy turned into the same glass shards that Tron's blade was made of.</p><br><p>"Well, let's see what we get this time." Tron said slowly reaching forward with his hand, palm facing the ground.</p><br><p>Tron's fingers tensed, twitching slightly as if he was trying to grip something, though there was nothing under his palm, just air.</p><br><p>At the same moment, hundreds of glass shards hovered around Tron and moved forward, surrounding both him and Adam.</p><br><p>Each shard took its place, fitting together perfectly like some complex puzzle, until they gradually formed a perfect dome covering part of the arena.</p><br><p>Adam gulped as he glanced around.</p><br><p>The dome was arranged in such a way that he and Tron could see everything that was happening outside, but the others couldn't view the events inside the dome.</p><br><p>"So... Let's get started." Tron said as he jerked his wrist at an odd angle.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a sharp shard, more like a tiny blade, flew out of the dome.</p><br><p>Its tip aimed straight for Adam's neck, cutting through the air currents.</p>
