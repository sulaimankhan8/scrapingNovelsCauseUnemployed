            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1145: White Heart</strong></p><br><br><p>Adam slowly approached Lyrod, striking the rods together to create a cascade of sparks. Gradually, they became hotter, which was a significant issue for Lyrod in this situation.</p><br><p>“What do you say?” Adam raised his chin arrogantly. “You’re strong, I can’t deny that, but your whole tactic is based on how effectively and safely you act. You have a backup plan for every outcome, but… what are you going to do now?”</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam lunged forward, quickly finding himself in front of Lyrod, who was still trying to comprehend the situation he was in.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, he had an answer to Adam’s question.</p><br><br><p>All the water around him returned to a state of energy as combat gauntlets covered his arms up to his elbows. Water flowed among the stone scales as his sharp fingertips flashed.</p><br><p>With a clang, Lyrod clashed with Adam, blocking his attack.</p><br><p>“I don’t know all the details of your ability, but why are you so confident in your victory?” Lyrod asked as they exchanged another attack.</p><br><br><p>The rod left a cut on Lyrod’s shoulder, but he didn’t even react to it because he knew that the dark sword would heal him in seconds.</p><br><p>“I may not be able to kill you, but your energy is not infinite. My strength is growing, but yours is not. Soon, you simply won’t be able to inflict as many wounds on me as I do on you, and your sword will be filled. I’m sure something bad will happen then, won’t it?”</p><br><p>Lyrod kept a calm expression as he conversed with Adam while blocking his rapid attacks time after time, but the first cracks appeared on his face, revealing the nervous trembling of his lips that he was trying to hide.</p><br><p>“Well, I’m afraid you’re wrong about that.”</p><br><br><p>Adam jumped back as he plunged the rods into the ground and needles appeared in both his hands. He inserted the small, bright needle into the large one, causing two streams of energy, black and white, to swirl around the wide blade.</p><br><p>The last time Adam used the path was also the first time his opponent was able to survive and block his strongest attack. The path couldn’t get through Arnoth’s shield, and Adam was on the verge of collapse because this ability required an enormous amount of energy.</p><br><p>It seemed like Adam was acting foolishly, because the Crown of the Fallen Prince only healed his wounds, it did not restore his energy reserves.</p><br><p>But Adam had a trump card that Lyrod had no idea about.</p><br><p>‘What is that?’ Lyrod muttered to himself, trying to understand what Adam was about to do.</p><br><p>But by the time the white tunnel was formed, it was too late to take any action.</p><br><br><p>Adam disappeared and reappeared behind Lyrod. There was no pain; all Lyrod saw was a splash of blood before his eyes, for he had just lost part of his body. The path destroyed everything in its path.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The black sword trembled, quickly healing Lyrod’s wound. Considering how serious the damage was, their swords were now equal. Adam’s was now less than half full instead of 80%, just like Lyrod’s.</p><br><p>In a slight panic, Lyrod rushed forward to get to a safe distance.</p><br><p>‘What was that?’ Lyrod thought as his pupils trembled. ‘He just disappeared and appeared behind me… It happened so fast that I couldn’t even react. Fuck! If it weren’t for his ability to heal me, I’d be dead by now!’</p><br><p>“HEY!” Lyrod’s angry shout echoed through the gorge. “What the fuck did you do?”</p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily as he chuckled quietly.</p><br><p>“Oh, so that’s what you were talking about when you mentioned your dark side. Well, well… Looks like you’re not happy that I hurt you. What a pity.”</p><br><p>A grimace crossed Lyrod’s face, his teeth grinding audibly as his heart pounded furiously.</p><br><p>“Bastard… No wonder I wanted to crush you like a bug the moment I saw you. I don’t know what you’re counting on, but your new ability has failed you. How much energy do you have left? I’m sure it’s not enough!”</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Lyrod stepped forward as he made several swings. His gauntlets glowed brightly, sending a multitude of water blades at Adam.</p><br><p>In response, Adam merely waved his second needle, creating a lesser path. This was enough to pass through all of Lyrod’s attacks and appear right in front of him.</p><br><p>“You see… I’m not so worried about my condition anymore.”</p><br><br><p>Adam’s fist, carrying the power of his Nexus, slammed into Lyrod’s chest. A dark, crimson burst tore through Lyrod’s chest with thread-like blades, throwing him back.</p><br><p>Before Lyrod’s back could reach the wall, Adam repeated these two actions, causing Lyrod’s sword to fill with more power.</p><br><p>“GET AWAY FROM ME! WORM!” Lyrod’s furious cry rang out like thunder as the raging torrents of water forced Adam to retreat, though he would have done so anyway.</p><br><br><p>Heavy breathing echoed around them, and it wasn’t coming from Lyrod but from Adam. Sure, he had wounded Lyrod badly and filled his sword more, but he had expended too much energy.</p><br><p>“WHAT? Are you satisfied now? What do you plan to do now? HAH!?” Lyrod growled as two jets of water pierced Adam’s shoulders.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped back without looking at his wounds. His back touched the cold ground as the corners of his lips turned up.</p><br><p>“Hahaha, do you think I did all this in a desperate attempt to defeat you quickly?”</p><br><p>Then, he shook his head as his needles shattered into fragments. Bright particles of energy flew before his eyes as he looked down at Lyrod.</p><br><p>Lyrod’s eyebrow twitched in irritation. He sensed that Adam was hiding something, but he couldn’t figure out what it was.</p><br><p>“Agh…” Adam exhaled cold breath as he looked at his black sword. “For me to be truly reckless, I need not only regeneration, but also endless energy, don’t I, Silvana?”</p><br><p>Lyrod’s eyes widened.</p><br><p>After that, particles of light gathered at Adam’s chest as he placed his palm on his heart.</p><br><p>For a moment, Lyrod saw it.</p><br><p>Through the fabric, flesh, and bone, he saw the outline of Adam’s heart, which was now white, glowing brightly from the energy overflowing from it.</p><br><p>For, along with the darkness that had left Adam’s artifact, the First Star energy had also freed Silvana’s ability, which had previously been blocked.</p>
