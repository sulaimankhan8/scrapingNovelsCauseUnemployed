            <br><p>Tron and Riska went up to the second floor, where the main action of the party was taking place.</p><br><p>They left their umbrella and Riska's bag on the first floor. A restaurant employee offered to take Tron's coat drenched in rain, but Tron refused, and no one was ready to argue with him.</p><br><p>Adam was drinking a cocktail with a curious look, watching Edir and Crita, who were now the center of general attention.</p><br><p>Edir may not have been the most polite and mannerly man, but he sure knew how to behave with women, especially the one he had chosen. The same could be said about his dancing skills.</p><br><p>"Wow... I didn't even think he was capable of that..." Lola muttered with her eyes wide open, watching Edir and Crita intently.</p><br><p>They were moving gracefully like a perfect duo, showing how high their mastery was and how they enjoyed the process.</p><br><p>Edir was the lead, guiding Crita, but sometimes she had to adjust to him as he occasionally made minor mistakes. It wasn't that he wasn't as good as he wanted to appear, just the last time they had danced was quite some time ago.</p><br><p>It was an important moment for both of them because back then, despite the stares of everyone else, their eyes were solely on each other.</p><br><p>Crita didn't hide her happiness at all - Edir tried to do so, but anyone could see that he was just as pleased with their relationship as Crita, perhaps even more.</p><br><p>"Graceful moves, it's worth recognizing that. They've both, clearly spent considerable time and effort on this." Silvana commented, even though she was left impressed, though she was usually silently appreciative.</p><br><p>Kayla bit her lip, it seemed that, unlike the others, she felt an emotion other than elation, or respect for their labor.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Louis approached Kayla - his long blue hair swayed slightly, catching her gaze, making her look into his captivating azure eyes, a trap from which it was very hard for a woman's heart to escape.</p><br><p>Kayla was puzzled, she didn't understand why Louis had decided to approach her when he should have been looking after Alexia.</p><br><p>Well... Right now, Alexia was competing with Katrin in who could eat the most cakes, so Louis had some free time on his hands.</p><br><br><p>Louis took Kayla by the chin, lifting it slightly, but he didn't look down at her, though he could - he was a little taller than Kayla.</p><br><p>"What the hell are you doing?" Kayla frowned heavily, immediately grabbing Louis by the wrist.</p><br><p>Most Phantoms that had been Phantoms for over a month had already learned to control their power in normal situations to avoid harming ordinary people - especially Operators.</p><br><p>However... Kayla was having some trouble with that. Before, she only communicated with her Operator or other Phantoms during missions.</p><br><p>Thus, she was now squeezing Louis's wrist a little harder than she should in a position like this.</p><br><p>"Martial lady, could you loosen your grip? I'm in pain." Louis uttered with narrowed eyes and a friendly smile.</p><br><p>"Agh... I didn't mean to..." Kayla ahhed, realizing what she was doing. Sure, it was Louis's own fault, but she had an obligation to control her power as a Phantom.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, there was the sound of a glass shattering.</p><br><p>Katrin and Kody looked in confusion at Alexia, her fists clenched tightly and glass dust falling from her hands - the shards of a simple glass could not harm her skin and crushed to powder under the pressure.</p><br><p>Alexia had clearly done it because of a sudden burst of anger, it only took a few seconds for the others to realize what had occurred, but... Louis wasn't going to let it happen.</p><br><p>Louis nodded slightly, then gently took Kayla's hand and said with a sly smile on his face:</p><br><p>"How about as an apology, you give me one dance? I won't ask for more than that."</p><br><p>Kayla blushed heavily, unable to do anything soon, so she only nodded shyly.</p><br><p>There was nothing to hide here - Kayla had never danced with a man, especially one as handsome as Louis. If other girls who couldn't take their eyes off Louis when he walked down the street saw her, they'd be very jealous of Kayla.</p><br><p>But jealousy was not the reason Alexia had broken the glass in anger. Louis understood that perfectly.</p><br><p>Though, at that moment, Alexia was having fun with Katrin, competing in eating cakes, but she noticed that Kayla's grip was too strong.</p><br><p>A few seconds of Louis's pain, though it wasn't even reflected on his face, was enough for Alexia to practically burn Kayla with her gaze.</p><br><p>In any other situation, Kayla would have noticed it, but then the storm of emotions literally engulfed her, and she was only thinking about one thing - the dance.</p><br><p>It wasn't even about Louis or the fact that he was handsome, it was about the attention from someone in person.</p><br><p>"Alexia... Are we going to continue?" Katrin asked awkwardly, but Alexia didn't answer her.</p><br><p>"Hah, looks like someone's jealous doesn't it?" Zera grinned wryly, realizing where Alexia was looking, "Don't worry. I'm sure Louis just decided to give her a little confidence boost. He's a good judge of people."</p><br><br><p>Before anyone could realize anything, Alexia grabbed Zera by the neck, squeezing hard with all five fingers, practically digging into her skin.</p><br><p>"Don't you dare say I'm jealous of him? Louis is my Operator, not my lover. But..." Alexia said coldly, tightening her grip, her gaze becoming as sharp as deadly blades.</p><br><p>"Louis belongs to me, and I won't let anyone hurt him. I swear, if I saw him wince in pain, I'd have smashed her face - into meat - by now." Alexia said menacingly.</p><br><p>For that brief period, her aura and personality changed completely - just like when she and Adam had fought the North Keeper during Eclipse.</p><br><p>Zera couldn't do anything, and Katrin was so shocked that she was confused, not knowing if she needed to intervene. She understood Alexia pretty well, though, because she had behaved the same way towards Kody during the fair.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Alexia took a deep breath and let Zera go.</p><br><p>"Damn, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. Sometimes, all it takes is a moment for bizarre thoughts to consume your mind. I'm just really, really worried about Louis..." Alexia muttered sincerely.</p><br><p>Zera and Katrin looked over at each other. It was just the three of them at this table.</p><br><p>"Not taking it personally. We fully understand you. After all, we have Operators too. Protecting and caring for our Operators is our primary responsibility, isn't it?" Zera smiled as if reading their thoughts.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, that's for sure. If I see some bitch messing with Alan, I'm going to smash her into the wall." Katrin clenched her fist, fire burning in her eyes.</p><br><br><p>While Zera, Katrin, and Alexia shared their dark thoughts, there were two duos, dancing in the center of the hall - Edir &amp; Crita and Louis &amp; Kayla.</p><br><p>Sure, Kayla had never danced before, but Louis was a real master at it. They didn't move as gracefully as Edir and Crita, but steadily and confidently.</p><br><p>A smile filled with joy appeared on Kayla's face, she was truly relishing this moment.</p><br><p>"Looks like someone's gained some missing confidence, doesn't it?" Louis asked, gently taking Kayla's hand and pulling her to him.</p><br><p>"Yeah... Something like that. I didn't even know I could dance that well." Kayla quickly replied, only blushing slightly.</p><br><p>Louis nodded approvingly.</p><br><p>"In that case, how about we do something a little more challenging?" Louis asked, quickly glancing at Edir, who responded in the same way. They didn't need words to understand each other.</p><br><br><p>Before Kayla could realize anything, Louis swung his hand sharply, causing Kayla to spin like a whirlwind.</p><br><p>Simultaneously, Edir did the same, releasing Crita, who got a baffled look on her face. </p><br><p>The girls whizzed by each other, only to find themselves in the arms of an estranged partner.</p><br><p>"Don't worry. I'll get you back to your lover soon." Louis said with a sly smile, "You don't mind my company for a few moves, do you?"</p><br><p>Crita's face contorted as she arrogantly lifted her chin.</p><br><p>"Fine, but don't even think about touching me anywhere but my back." Crita said menacingly.</p><br><br><p>Without further ado, Louis pulled Crita to him as he had previously done with Kayla, but keeping a distance.</p><br><p>"Sure, that forbidden fruit is only for Edir, isn't it? For him, you are willing to allow anything, but for others, you are an ice queen. How romantic." Louis smirked, driving Crita into the colors.</p><br><p>She might have wanted to say something back, but they'd already taken a few steps, and it was time to change again.</p><br><p>In his arms was Kayla, clearly shaken by what was happening.</p><br><p>"Is something wrong? You look confused." Louis asked, taking Kayla's hand.</p><br><p>Kayla shook her head.</p><br><p>"It's okay... It's probably wrong to think so, but for some reason, I expected Edir to do more than that. I mean... He's always groping Crita, and he's not even shy." Kayla blushed.</p><br><p>Louis nodded, "Yes. Her and only her. That's the whole point."</p><br><p>Soon, oddly enough, Kody and Katrin joined them, becoming the third duo. He had to ask her several times, though Katrin was actually ready to agree from the first, but she couldn't admit it.</p><br><p>"Oh, this is something I didn't expect at all." Tron uttered, appearing next to Adam.</p><br><p>Adam flinched, he totally forgot about Tron.</p><br><p>'Right... So that's who I didn't notice... I didn't expect him to come.' Adam inwardly muttered.</p><br><p>------------------------------------------</p><br><p>Hi, sorry for the delay, only one chapter so far.
