            <br><p>Phantoms died, very often, and not uncommonly. It was because a weaker Phantom was next to a stronger Phantom, who was fighting a powerful monster. It happened from time to time, and it had happened to Adam.</p><br><p>When he fought the Steel Knight, several Phantoms died in the earthquake that the Steel Knight had caused with his ability.</p><br><p>However, there was nothing he could do about it, then he was forced to stay close to the Phantoms that were trapped in ice crystals.</p><br><p>However, this time was completely different.</p><br><p>'No... If I hadn't used the third trait, the wolf wouldn't have had so much energy... It's only because of me that this laser is so powerful.' Adam inwardly muttered with a pale face.</p><br><p>'Adam, calm down. Casualties are inevitable, you must realize that.' Silvana said serenely, trying to set him at ease.</p><br><p>"Shut up!!! These aren't victims! This is practically murder, just not by my hands!" Adam growled harshly.</p><br><p>Silvana was taken aback for a while. Adam had never shouted at her before, but Silvana wasn't about to take offense. It only showed that the situation was close to critical.</p><br><p>'Settle down. I'm trying to help you, you know that as well as the fact that you can't change the past. You can only affect the present, and you have to do that. You're a Phantom, so get to work and kill the monster before there are more victims!' Silvana said belligerently, igniting a powerful flame in Adam.</p><br><p>Adam's face returned to normal, and the trembling stopped. This was exactly what he needed to hear right now.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you're right." Adam nodded, summoning the needle, a second grip, "The Phantom's job is not to defend against monsters but to kill them, to eliminate the threat."</p><br><p>Then, without further ado, Adam lunged forward, colliding with Azure Wolf, whose sharp claws came down on his needle, but Adam easily blocked the attack.</p><br><p>The ice beneath him cracked, clots of snow flying before his eyes while he pierced the intimidating Azure Wolf with his gaze. The monster was several times larger than Adam, but its strength wasn't enough to make Adam's arm shake or lose his balance.</p><br><p>"I can't resurrect those you've already killed, but... I can save those who were going to be your next targets." Adam uttered, taking a step forward.</p><br><p>Azure Wolf's eyes went wide, since he couldn't stop Adam, he had to step back, leaving streaks on the ice from his sharp claws.</p><br><p>Adam attacked, quickly raining his needle down on Azure Wolf's head.</p><br><br><p>Azure Wolf blocked the attack with his sharp claws, cascades of sparks flying off to the sides.</p><br><p>Clash. Clash. Clash.</p><br><p>Then, again and again. Although Adam attacked using only one hand, his speed, and second grip allowed him to gradually overwhelm Azure Wolf.</p><br><p>The monster struggled to react to Adam's lunges, occasionally falling short and taking light wounds.</p><br><p>Azure Wolf realized that eventually, the cuts would become too many, the bleeding would intensify and would lead to a mistake that Adam would surely take advantage of. Azure Wolf couldn't let that happen, so the monster decided to use a trump card that Adam didn't have.</p><br><p>"ROOOOOAAAAAAARRRRRR!!!"</p><br><p>Prime Azure Wolf roared furiously, covering the entire battlefield with its howl and causing the other Azure Wolves to stop, turning their heads in this direction.</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" The young man, whose right hand was bleeding, muttered in a puzzled way. He had fought Azure Wolf, but right now, the monster wasn't paying any attention to him.</p><br><br><p>Before the young man could realize it, Azure Wolf was rushing forward, heading for Adam as well as hundreds of its fellows.</p><br><p>The dozens of Phantoms could breathe a sigh of relief, for they no longer had to fear the sharp claws and powerful jaws that would tear them apart. However, they couldn't help but worry about the fate of one of the captains of their squad.</p><br><p>"Adam! Run away!" Owen exclaimed. He was well aware of the danger Adam was in, as someone who always protected others.</p><br><p>However, it was already too late.</p><br><p>There were too many Azure Wolves, not a single gap between them, crowding the entire space like endless packs of rats.</p><br><p>Fred, standing in the distance, frowned as his eyes glowed, and he pointed his bow upward, aiming at the sky and gathering energy for the cluster arrow.</p><br><br><p>A second before Fred was to release the arrow, something slammed into him, throwing him aside.</p><br><p>"What the fuck are you doing?!" Fred shouted, glaring hatefully at Ester, who had purposely crashed into him.</p><br><p>"I'm the one who should be asking you! You can't control your arrows, can you? A few of them will probably hurt Adam! You'll just blow him up along with the monsters!" Ester exclaimed, waving her hand.</p><br><p>Fred got a frightening grimace.</p><br><p>"You stupid bitch! You just killed him! His speed is enough to dodge most of my arrows! Better to get a few wounds from my attacks than be torn apart by hundreds of wild wolves' jaws! That's exactly what will happen now because of you!"</p><br><p>Ester flinched as she turned around, looking at Adam, there was no one to help him. She acted instinctively and hastily as usual, but this time she had to sacrifice something to save Adam rather than trying to make everything perfect. Hurt him, but save him - it would be the right choice.</p><br><p>'Adam! Try to escape! If you reach Owen, he can protect you!' Silvana shouted, realizing that against so many opponents, Adam couldn't stand a chance.</p><br><p>However, when her voice sounded in Adam's earbud, the first jaw was already in front of his face. Adam had no choice but to act here and now.</p><br><br><p>Adam brought his fist down on the wolf's head, plunging it into the ground, then he stepped forward and bounced off the wolf, jumping as high as he could.</p><br><p>If Adam could fly, he would easily escape to a safe distance, but without wings, it was impossible. So Adam only delayed his death for a few seconds, after which he would fall to the ground, right into the open jaws of the wolves.</p><br><p>The silver needle shattered into threads as Adam's eyes flashed. The currents of wind accelerated, thickening around Adam as if he were the center of an impending storm.</p><br><p>Then, he placed his hands above each other, palms inward, as if holding an invisible ball.</p><br><p>The particles of energy turned into hundreds of threads, quickly forming a Silver Swirl, but, this time, the sphere was several times larger than when Adam had fought the Phantoms of the Lower Ring.</p><br><p>Now, he was using the second stage of his Second Nexus Trait - using two hands and multiple times more energy.</p><br><p>"I might not be able to destroy the Artic Colossuses with a single attack, but it will be more than enough for you." Adam muttered before throwing Silve Swirl directly at the wolves.</p><br><p>The threads spun fast and deadly, like thousands of tiny blades, gradually expanding their kill zone, for one purpose - to kill as many monsters as possible, to cut them apart, leaving no chance of survival, of seeing the next dawn.</p>
