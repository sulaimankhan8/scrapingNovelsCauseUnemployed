            <br><p>In some ways, monsters and humans were strongly similar - they could change their minds and attack at any moment, all it took was a good reason for a rapid change and the four-pointed rune was more than worthy of one.</p><br><p>'Oh, so the battle can't be avoided then? Well, it was long overdue, but what is this rune? It has something to do with the Outer Artifact of this place.'</p><br><p>The Dark Walkers' skinny hands gripped Adam's coat, going to tear him apart, unwilling to accept that Phantom could take their treasure.</p><br><p>They weren't the only ones, a multitude of Dark Walkers ran at Adam's side, some down the passageways and some out of the walls through clots of darkness.</p><br><p>There were many, dozens of them, and it was unknown how many more lurked in the corners of the massive fortress.</p><br><p>Yet, this was not an opponent they stood any chance against.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, dark hands covered Adam's body like writhing chains, wanting to plunge him into the depths of the abyss, to turn this place into his grave.</p><br><p>Then, his eyes shone brightly, in his right hand appeared a long needle that was not just a weapon but the definition of the future for every monster surrounding Adam.</p><br><br><br><p>A black boot dipped into a pool of blood, a tall silhouette towering over dozens of corpses cut apart or struck by a single precision slash.</p><br><p>The Dark Walkers desperately tried to get rid of the Phantom that entered their territory, but they hardly had any chance of success.</p><br><br><p>Hot steam came out at Adam's sigh, his deep eyes glanced around. Dark blood streamed down the stairs, becoming a sign to everyone in the fortress - someone strong arrived.</p><br><p>The pale eyes of the monsters lost their light forever and even the purple flames of the torches were unable to remedy this matter, directing all their attention to the lonely Phantom standing by himself.</p><br><p>The monsters hadn't won, they hadn't even come close, but they had accomplished something - four long cuts ran down Adam's shoulder, bleeding slightly.</p><br><p>It wasn't a wound Adam would remember in a few minutes, but it would stay with him until the very end because of the effect of the local irregular energy.</p><br><p>'Hmm... I thought all the monsters in the fortress would have flame abilities. That would be a big problem for me, but apparently, I was wrong.'</p><br><p>Silvana's calm Silvana's voice rang out:</p><br><p>'Are you alright? I don't see any more of the Dark Watchers around, it looks like the flame stream is attracting some specific quantity of opponents.'</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply clenching his fist tightly.</p><br><p>"Yeah, a few scratches are all they were able to leave in exchange for their lives."</p><br><p>The desire to find out what function the four-pointed rune had made Adam head forward, but stepping over the Dark Walker's corpse, Adam's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"Oh, right... If you killed a monster then you should... Hah, I forgot the last time I did that."</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam dispelled the needle into particles of light and extended his arm forward.</p><br><p>White streams of energy appeared in front of his palm transforming into an active vortex - the Revolve. For a multitude of reasons, it had been a very long time since Adam absorbed monster genes.</p><br><p>Not that he needed it for anything other than to amplify his Gene Field, at least not yet, but he just wanted to remember what it was like.</p><br><p>Your next read awaits at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Hmm...?" Adam raised an eyebrow when instead of absorbing the monsters' genes, the vortex spun faster becoming much larger.</p><br><p>Then, out of the Revolve came rapid streams connecting with each of the Dark Walkers, covering dozens of monsters in a single motion.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Dark Walkers' bodies shuddered, releasing runes of rich yellow color, the runes simultaneously flowed out in streams like a fast-flowing river, instantly absorbed by Adam's Revolve.</p><br><p>[Gene of the Dark Walker absorbed - received a Mid Yellow Gene x1]</p><br><p>[Gene of the Dark Walker absorbed - received a Mid Yellow Gene x1]</p><br><p>[Gene of the Dark Walker...]</p><br><p>Dozens of messages filled Adam's mind, not as mechanical as the first time he became a Phantom, for now, he heard the voice of his Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>All the genes went straight to the Gene Cube before disappearing into the snow-white book - his Vault. This not only reminded Adam of a long-forgotten feeling but also enhanced his Gene Field as these were the first Mid Yellow Genes in his collection.</p><br><p>"Agh... That felt good, and it seems when I became a K2-Phantom my Revolve got stronger as well, I just didn't get a chance to experience it."</p><br><p>A slight smile appeared on Adam's face. For the past three months, all he did was train and fight against people. He didn't feel like a Phantom but just a human with abilities, it wasn't what his heart desired.</p><br><p>'Adam, I don't think you should delay. We need to find out what this rune is and if it's related to the External Artifact.' Silvana said seriously.</p><br><p>She understood how Adam felt, but he was alone amongst the hundreds of monsters roaming the fortress, he always should be on guard.</p><br><p>"Hush my caring Operator..." Adam said in a low calm voice, but one that did not tolerate objections.</p><br><p>Before Silvana could say anything, Adam slowly swung his hand before heading towards the flame stream raging from the stone slab.</p><br><p>"Haven't you realized that yet?"</p><br><p>Silvana couldn't be more confused.</p><br><p>"I've already won this round and no one will attack until I collect my reward. If they wanted to, the four monsters on the towers would have already unleashed their full power on me."</p><br><br><p>Adam reached out his hand about to touch the flame.</p><br><p>Before he could do so, the flames shuddered as a four-pointed rune headed toward Adam stopping above his palm.</p><br><p>"What...?" Adam muttered in a daze, it seemed to him that the rune was alive.</p><br><p>Then, the rune shone brightly turning into four streams of dense light flowing into his hand, wanting to burn its mark on his flesh and blood.</p>
