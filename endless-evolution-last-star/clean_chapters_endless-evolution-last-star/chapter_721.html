            <br><p>Some monsters were too strong for their level to be interested in ordinary battles and even valuable resources, they were like that for other monsters but not for special ones.</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord was one of them, the proof of that was not him ignoring the situation but not paying attention to Katrin.</p><br><p>Sure, the Dormant Lord noticed Katrin, he was aware of her presence as soon as she entered the Crystal Gorge.</p><br><p>He allowed her to roam his territory, to fight against his subordinates and kill them. If Katrin were to take and steal some energy crystals and wanted to run away, the Dormant Lord would not stop her.</p><br><p>Why then did Dormant Lord destroy the fighter that just appeared in his field of vision? Katrin was much closer, but the monster wouldn't attack her.</p><br><p>It was because Katrin was worthy of such treatment from Dormant Lord, he could sense it from her aura and because none of his monsters were able to harm her.</p><br><p>Among humans, such a situation was not uncommon. Two opponents, whether in business, relationships, or politics could hate each other, but the hatred was caused by the fact that they could not easily get rid of each other since their powers were equal.</p><br><p>Discover hidden stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>From this was born respect, or simply recognition of the status of the other person, which for example could not get their loyal subordinates because their status was lower.</p><br><p>The fighter and the monsters of the Crystal Gorge could not give the Dormant Lord a decent fight, Katrin could - that was the whole idea.</p><br><p>However, she escaped. It was the right decision for her, so the Dormant Lord was left alone.</p><br><p>Usually, he was awake only at night, yet during the Eclipse he wanted to sleep again. It was not the night, not the bright moon he expected.</p><br><p>Crystal Gorge had plenty of valuable resources besides the massive energy crystals at every turn, but the Dormant Lord wasn't worried about the brazen monsters from the waves taking over his domain.</p><br><p>His subordinates were strong enough to defend themselves and their home, but at the very least, the Dormant Lord himself would enter the fray upon awakening from sleep.</p><br><p>The Eclipse, the nearest Stronghold, and the chance to absorb the External Artifact were reason enough for the thousands of monsters running in the waves to risk their lives.</p><br><p>Yet, for the Dormant Lord, it wasn't sufficient.</p><br><p>It wasn't what he needed, not what would move him forward and start the process of evolution.</p><br><p>He didn't feel curiosity or awe, the desire to return to slumber was far more appealing.</p><br><br><p>Once the crimson energy like wildfire burst from the depths of the fortress, becoming more visible even than the flash of the Blinding Sylphyre, everything changed.</p><br><br><p>The Dormant Lord rose from the massive crystal that was his throne, a loud crunch spreading out from the sides.</p><br><p>Seeing their leader's movements, monsters remotely resembling lizards came into motion. Their long bodies swept by the crystals, eager to see what the Dorman Lord was up to.</p><br><p>However, the Dormant Lord was in no hurry to go anywhere, nor did he have any reason to. He took a few heavy steps forward before stomping heavily on the surface.</p><br><br><p>A lone shiver passed through the Crystal Gorge as five tall, level crystals more like pillars slowly emerged from the ground.</p><br><p>The front of these crystals was transparent almost like glass, but the murky layer made it impossible to see what was inside.</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord stretched his hand forward as his fingertips trembled, bright spheres appearing out of nowhere.</p><br><p>At his will, the spheres traveled towards the crystals, unlocking them like keys to a dungeon.</p><br><br><p>The transparent covers cracked, shattering into tiny fragments, a stream of thick fog poured out, hiding the lone silhouettes.</p><br><p>Simultaneously, five figures stepped forward, presenting themselves to their leader, their lord.</p><br><p>The five maidens looked up at their lord. Their bodies were covered in crystals, and their pale gray skin was covered in tiny, shimmering plates, not protection like scales on lizards, but rather their armor.</p><br><p>Their legs and arms were elongated, and their build was skinny, with two crystals emerging from their feet, as if mimicking high heels.</p><br><p>A snow-white cloth of thousands of tiny crystals fell from their shoulders, covering their backs like a jewel, the same accessory falling over their faces.</p><br><p>Like the Dorman Lord, the maidens had no eyes or mouth, instead, they had only a crystal cap covering their front.</p><br><br><p>Without delay, the Diamond Servants, knelt down, awaiting the command from their lord.</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord only nodded slightly as he made a wide sweep of his hand, pointing at the entire Crystal Gorge.</p><br><p>The Diamond Servants nodded deeply, they understood his order from a single gesture. Then, the Diamond Servants separated, turning into five shadows heading in different directions.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, each maiden took their position in Crystal Gorge, intending to defend their home even at the cost of their lives. Some found themselves at the very top, some were to head to the depths waiting for the first monsters determined to grab their crystals.</p><br><p>Well, that would hardly happen while the Dormant Lord was here, the monsters could sense his terrifying aura from miles away, though he kept his aura calm.</p><br><br><p>Reluctantly, the Dormant Lord approached one of the largest crystals, extending his hand towards it, palm open.</p><br><p>The crystal shuddered vigorously, a stream of energy coming out, taking the shape of a great spear under the Dormant Lord's will.</p><br><p>A few seconds were enough for the bright crystal to lose all its light, turning into a gray fragment, but soon it would be filled with energy again thanks to the Crystal Gorge.</p><br><p>Yet, it was only a shell, as the Dormant Lord had to use his energy to finish the spear.</p><br><p>Then, the Dormant Lord took a few steps back, the plasma spear in his hand trembling ready to explode at any moment, but his grip was too strong.</p><br><br><p>At a strange angle, the Dormant Lord threw the spear forward with all his might.</p><br><p>Soon, another bright star appeared above the Fortress of the Lone Serpent, but it had a speed much greater than the others, ready to fall.</p>
