            <br><p>Seyrina said what Adam waited so long to hear.</p><br><p>Unlike his past leaps in strength, he had a hard, long road to K3, mostly because of Osana's wishes and the wedding that led him to fight under the gaze of the nobles.</p><br><p>Adam learned and mastered a lot during that time, yet he was still a K2-Phantom, though the events in the fortress were far more productive than he expected.</p><br><p>Initially, Adam thought that he would destroy his First Wall in the fortress, but in the end, he came out with the Star Seal activated and was ready to take the very last step—to create the Second Key.</p><br><p>A slight smile appeared on Adam's face.</p><br><p>"Hah, I'm ready to do it even now. I don't know what condition I need to fulfill to create the Second Key, but I can handle it, that's for sure."</p><br><p>Seyrina nodded deeply as she crossed her arms over her chest.</p><br><p>"Good, very good. However, you shouldn't be in a hurry. I think the next time something like this happens to Silvana will be in seven or ten days. Take one day to get some proper sleep and rest."</p><br><p>Before Adam could object, Seyrina thrust her hand forward with an open palm:</p><br><p>"I understand your concern, but nothing will happen to Silvana tomorrow. You came back from the Dead Lands and headed straight here. You need to recharge, you've been through a lot this night."</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana exchanged glances. They realized that Seyrina was right. At the very least, they could suppress Silvana's energy burst again since she could feel it building up in her Evolution Sprout.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Adam sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"Sure, I'll do as you said, but... what next? Should I just create the Second Key and that's it?"</p><br><p>Seyrina gave a quick reply:</p><br><p>"Yes, once you become a K3-Phantom, then Silvana will be affected as well. Excess energy will have somewhere to go, your control will increase greatly as well, so the problem will cease to exist."</p><br><br><p>In a deft move, Seyrina rose from the table, tapping lightly on the surface.</p><br><p>"And, since I've decided to help you, I'll have to do it all the way. When you realize you need my help with the Second Key, then contact me."</p><br><br><p>Adam turned around slowly, confused.</p><br><p>Before walking away, Seyrina glared at him over her shoulder.</p><br><p>"Rest assured, you'll soon realize what I'm talking about. Then, you'll learn something about the Citadel unavailable to K2-Phantoms and below."</p><br><p>Without a moment's hesitation, Seyrina walked away, leaving Adam and Silvana alone with their thoughts.</p><br><p>The coffee slowly cooled, the trickles of steam faded away, and silence took its course.</p><br><p>Soon, Silvana turned around, glancing at a pensive Adam. He tried to hide it, but she could see that the short sleep on the fighter on the way to the Citadel clearly wasn't enough.</p><br><p>Thanks to his stamina Adam could stay awake for a long time, several days if necessary but, he was far from his peak state.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Silvana realized this not only by his appearance. She could feel it, she could sense that the core she depended on was exhausted.</p><br><p>Gently, Silvana took Adam by the hand, squeezing him in a gentle embrace. A pleasant warmth drew Adam in, causing him to turn around.</p><br><br><p>"Go back home, though no, better get a room somewhere. You need to be alone right now, in silence. Sleep as much as your body wants, same goes for food and water."</p><br><p>Adam smiled weakly, his gaze deepening.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you're right... You're both right. I'm rushing things."</p><br><br><p>Nothing unexpected happened that day. Adam bid Silvana farewell and decided to take her advice.</p><br><p>Despite the long battle and the experiences, Adam didn't feel hungry. In fact, he ate Silvana's fruit because he was bored, so he decided to do something to keep himself busy.</p><br><p>He wasn't hungry enough to throw himself at the fruit, he didn't want to eat right now unlike the strong sense of sleep overwhelming him.</p><br><p>As soon as he saw the massive bed in the rented hotel room, his eyelids grew heavy and his body made its way to the soft mattress.</p><br><p>Phantoms slept as much as normal people, some more than others, some less, Adam was no exception.</p><br><p>However, sometimes Phantoms could sleep much longer than regular people on average because their exhaustion was not only physical but also on the energy side.</p><br><p>After eight hours nothing changed, Adam continued to sleep slowly breathing, the sun was about to go down.</p><br><p>This time the night was quiet as well as Adam's long sleep.</p><br><p>Only when the sun rose to its zenith level did his eyebrows twitch and his eyes slowly opened.</p><br><p>Adam didn't know how long his sleep lasted, but he was asleep for almost twenty-four hours.</p><br><p>The first thing he felt was dryness as if his mouth was a desert and a rapidly increasing hunger.</p><br><p>"Well..." his hoarse voice broke, "It's time to move on. Earlier than I planned, but it can't be helped. Breakfast first!"</p><br><br><p>Adam had done something like this before, now he had to leave mountains of empty plates and glasses on his table again. He ate and drank non-stop, his body wanted to restock and Adam didn't mind.</p><br><p>The Phantoms stopped at this retreat often, so no one paid much attention to it. At some point, each Phantom had enough money to use the expensive rooms.</p><br><p>Then, finally feeling satiated after a long period, Adam left the hotel and went straight to the clothing store.</p><br><p>He changed everything but his shoes and coat, and replaced the vest and shirt with a spacious black shirt and dark gray pants.</p><br><p>Sure, it was clothing from the monster threads, Adam didn't get rid of them, but he wanted something new and fresh. However, there was no way he was going to give up his coat and boots.</p><br><p>Choosing a quiet place, Adam settled on the Second Ring. There were many forests and fields, where he ended up.</p><br><br><p>Looking around, observing only silence, Adam nodded deeply before entering his inner space.</p><br><p>"The Second Key... Hopefully, it will be easy to create you."</p>
