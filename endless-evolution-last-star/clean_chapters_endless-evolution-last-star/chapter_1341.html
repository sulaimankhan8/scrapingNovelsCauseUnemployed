            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1341: Crystal Threads and Barrier</strong></p><br><p>“Did you do this?” Adam asked, looking at the outfit floating above the platform, from the boots to the long coat.</p><br><p>In response, Misty nodded.</p><br><p>“Sure. I have many hobbies and skills in various crafts, and I’m much better at tailoring than cooking, I can assure you.”</p><br><p>Then, she pointed to her dress. “I made all of this. Even the boss’s clothes are mostly made by me. Also, don’t worry that I’ll be able to control you somehow through this outfit.”</p><br><p>“Why?” Adam asked, wary.</p><br><p>In response, Misty pulled a piece of dark fabric out of her pocket, bending it in such a way as to reveal thousands of threads that occasionally flashed with bright colors.</p><br><p>“This fabric is not made from the monster threads, but from the crystal threads. Making them and obtaining them is much more difficult, requiring either special and very rare monsters or hours of work on the crystals full of high-level energy. As a result, you get something like this.”</p><br><p>She waved her hand as a single thread followed the tip of her finger. If you looked closely, you could see tiny bumps that were actually crystals, but it wasn’t noticeable even from a close distance.</p><br><p>“I used these threads to create your entire outfit, from your boots to your coat. Also, these aren’t the most common crystal threads.”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam raised an eyebrow, puzzled. “You know, this is the first time I’ve seen the crystal threads. And you’re saying these are special ones?”</p><br><p>Misty nodded deeply. “Of course. The boss gave permission to use several high-level Midnight Crystals for your outfit, so about 5% of your outfit is made up of Midnight Crystals.”</p><br><p>Adam’s jaw dropped as he leaned forward sharply, studying the piece of fabric in Misty’s hands.</p><br><p>She continued. “That’s why you sometimes see multicolored light.”</p><br><p>Adam said nothing, she just admired the light running through the threads for a while before nodding deeply.</p><br><p>He understood that the outfit Franz had made for him was no longer suitable for his current level, just like any other clothing made from monster threads. The crystal threads were the next level up, and thanks to the resources available to the Black Cut, Adam was able to get some special threads.</p><br><p>“So, how durable are they?” he asked.</p><br><p>Misty put a piece of fabric in her pocket.</p><br><p>“Strong enough to match your body’s strength. Don’t expect your new outfit to make you stronger or increase your defense, but it definitely won’t tear from an accidental gust of wind, and if you get injured, it will quickly repair itself using a small amount of your energy.”</p><br><p>Then, she pointed to the coat floating above the ground.</p><br><p>“Go ahead. I want to see how it looks on you. While you were sleeping, I had enough time to take all the measurements. Everything should be loose and fit you snugly, but not too tight.”</p><br><p>Adam frowned. “What? Why did you have to do this at night? Couldn’t you have just asked me?”</p><br><p>Misty looked away, no hint of guilt in her gaze.</p><br><p>“Pfffft. I do what’s necessary for the job.” She snorted. “Stop complaining and change your rags for something decent.”</p><br><p>Adam rolled his eyes but did as she said.</p><br><p>Misty didn’t look away when she saw Adam’s bare back; she didn’t know what shame was, and Adam couldn’t do anything about it.</p><br><p>Muttering something under his breath, he put on his pants, shirt, and boots, and finally threw on his coat before turning to Misty.</p><br><p>“So? How do I look?” he asked with a hint of hope in his voice. He liked his old outfit, and he hoped this one wouldn’t look worse on him.</p><br><p>In response, Misty nodded toward the mirror.</p><br><p>“You can see for yourself.”</p><br><p>Adam sighed and looked up as his eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br><p>A strict, black coat fell to his knees with long, sharp edges. Five large square buttons stood out brightly with their silver light against the dark background, covering the right edge of the coat.</p><br><p>The shirt and pants were also black, but the shade was slightly lighter, offering a slight purple glimmer.</p><br><p>The outfit was completed by heavy, sturdy boots with iron chains pulling the thick fabric together instead of laces.</p><br><p>“Are you happy with everything?” Misty asked, looking at Adam, who was examining his simple but complete outfit.</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam nodded slightly.</p><br><p>“Yeah, I wasn’t expecting a gift like this, but…” He smiled broadly, showing all his teeth. “I like it!”</p><br><p>With a slight tremor, Silvana appeared beside him in her spectral form and touched her chin thoughtfully.</p><br><p>“It’s good, really good.” Her gaze ran over the sharp edges of Adam’s coat. “It’s not just clothing, it’s a combat outfit specifically for the Dead Lands.”</p><br><p>Misty stared at her.</p><br><p>“Of course. I make clothes for other monsters, for the Lords, and such powerful beings as the boss. Clothes, especially those made from crystal threads, are useless if you’re not going to fight in them. That should be clear to you.”</p><br><p>Adam patted himself on the chest and turned to Misty.</p><br><p>“Alright, what’s next? Now I’ll go to the Silver Beacon?”</p><br><p>In response, she nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“Yes. I’ll guide you, but at one point I’ll have to leave you. I’m not strong enough to ignore the Silver Beacon’s barrier without serious consequences for myself.”</p><br><p>Adam’s expression became more serious. If the Silver Beacon was dangerous even for Misty, then he had to be careful.</p><br><p>Adjusting his collar one last time, Adam and Misty left Norax’s mill and headed straight for the bright light in the distance.</p><br><p>Norax, Karso, and Narica watched them leave from the top of the mill, while two figures gradually emerged from the dark lands and approached a unique part of the Forgotten Mills.</p><br><p>The grass and earth became snow-white, shining brightly even in the deep night. They did not need light, nor did the Silver Beacon covering the vast lands around them with its light.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Misty stopped when Adam, unaware, crossed the barrier. For Misty, this was the end of the road.</p><br><p>“Agh?” Adam turned around, meeting Misty’s calm gaze.</p><br><p>“You’re on your own from here.” She pointed ahead. “I won’t cross the barrier without an invitation. Good luck, and one last piece of advice.”</p><br><p>Adam listened intently as Misty smiled faintly.</p><br><p>“You can only get out if you convince the Silver Beacon that you are worthy. You don’t need to make anything up, just be yourself.”</p><br><br><p>“Then that’s exactly what I’m going to do!”</p>
