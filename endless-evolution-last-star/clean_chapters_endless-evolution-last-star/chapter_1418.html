            <h4>Chapter 1418: Fear of Death</h4><br><p>No one knew all of Adam’s abilities, well, except for Silvana. Even for someone like Xander, each of Adam’s abilities was something unexpected and intriguing. As a monster who had lived for hundreds of years, he had seen a lot, but Adam’s abilities were somewhat unique because the Silver Weaver, his first monster, was the first of its kind at that time.
</p><br><p>Still, after several months, Adam wasn’t a nobody. Many monsters knew his name and were aware of his achievements and some of his abilities.
</p><br><p>The fact that Adam used a needle and threads for battle was known to every monster.
</p><br><br><p>"What is that?" Erada muttered fearfully, looking at the black threads floating around Adam.
</p><br><p>Now, there were no disks above Adam’s hands. All the threads emanated from the energy bracelets on his wrists. Most of the threads were white, as they should be, but some of them were black. This color was something new for Adam.
</p><br><p>Obviously, it was a reflection of the changes that had occurred with Lone Blaze after the Silver Weaver took his place in Adam’s inner space. The Silver Weaver could not significantly influence Silvana or the Evolution Tree, nor did he have such a desire, but Lone Blaze was a different case.
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver believed she was not strong enough. This was a flaw and a weakness in Adam’s powers, so he personally corrected it.
</p><br><br><p>Footsteps echoed in the void as the Silver Weaver appeared before Lone Blaze in her domain.
</p><br><p>"Are you all right?" he asked, looking at the girl.
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze’s eyes were closed, while countless threads floated around her. Bright flames emanated from her feet, showing the stability of her energy.
</p><br><p>"Yes." She nodded deeply. "I’m afraid Adam won’t be careful enough with his new threads, but it will definitely contribute to their battle."
</p><br><p>"Great. I’m glad to hear that," the Silver Weaver replied as he turned to leave.
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze’s voice made him pause for a moment:
</p><br><p>"Thank you... I know that if you wanted to, you could have just absorbed me to make Adam’s needle stronger... I appreciate it."
</p><br><p>A slight smirk formed on his face.
</p><br><p>"Don’t mention it. After all, I am his desire. If Adam wanted to, he would have gotten rid of you long ago. But, fortunately for both of us, he is not one to sacrifice others. For him, it is far better to spill a river of his own blood and win standing in the middle of it than anything else."
</p><br><p>"But..." Lone Blaze’s voice faltered as darkness engulfed the Silver Weaver. "What about Silvana? She must hold a special place, doesn’t she?"
</p><br><p>For a moment, Lone Blaze opened her eyes only to see the Silver Weaver’s smirk and devious gaze.
</p><br><p>"No one. No one but Adam matters. I know that. You’re beginning to understand it. Silvana will realize it in the future. We are merely planets revolving around the sun, one bright star. Without that star, we will all turn to pieces of ice, to nothingness."
</p><br><p>With his grim speech, the Silver Weaver left.
</p><br><p>The Lone Blaze’s head jerked, but she shook it to regain her composure. She knew the Silver Weaver was right, but she just couldn’t say it as easily as he did.
</p><br><p>"Alright..." she whispered. "Right now, I need to focus on something else. The black threads, they are the dangerous ones."
</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam pulled his hand back, and the white threads obeyed him.
</p><br><p>Erada watched his every move closely as Adam swung his threads, bringing them down like a whip.
</p><br><p>’Wait... What is he doing?’ she thought. ’There’s too much distance between us! He just can’t reach me!’
</p><br><p>However, as soon as the first glint of the whip rushing towards her appeared, all her thoughts disappeared, as her instincts took complete control of the situation.
</p><br><br><p>A stream of dust shot up from the cut surface, right next to Erada. A lock of her bright hair was cut off by the razor-sharp threads as a piece of earth fell away from her left foot, dropping into the abyss.
</p><br><p>If she had hesitated for a moment, the white threads would have cut her in two or, at best, inflicted a serious wound.
</p><br><p>But Erada had only one question in her mind:
</p><br><p>’If these are his usual threads, then what are the black ones capable of?!’
</p><br><p>As if reading her thoughts, Adam grinned widely and spread his arms wide.
</p><br><p>"Look! You’ll be the first to see it! Even I don’t know what will happen!"
</p><br><p>Then, Adam’s posture changed as he put one hand forward and the other back, as if he was about to shoot a bow. The two ends of the black thread followed his palms, but did not touch his skin, they just hovered nearby.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>When the black thread was fully stretched and reached its limit, it began to shake violently, like a sharp blade ready to strike.
</p><br><p>Erada’s eyes widened when Adam raised his back hand, which was the signal for the black threads to strike.
</p><br><p>Before Erada could even realize what was happening, the black thread flew through dozens of meters, and this time, even her Hybrid instincts couldn’t help her.
</p><br><p>All Erada managed to do was tilt her body slightly to the right.
</p><br><br><p>With a splash of blood, the black thread pierced her already wounded left shoulder with such force and speed that her muscles tore, her bone shattered, and her left arm flew off to the side.
</p><br><p>The spectators, both in the city and beyond, fell silent in shock.
</p><br><p>Even the always calm Xander couldn’t contain his emotions this time.
</p><br><p>"This... This is impressive," he said dryly, but his voice trembled.
</p><br><p>Helasa gulped, staring at Adam in disbelief.
</p><br><p>’Just one attack, one black thread, and such an effect. What’s more, he has several more, and each one is a deadly weapon!’
</p><br><p>That was the moment when Erada’s face paled as she felt the fear of death, a real one she had already forgotten.</p>
