            <br><p>Strangely enough, the Fallen Ring Castle hadn't been this quiet in a long time.</p><br><p>The Light Legion was defeated. If any of their troops remained, they were hiding and posed no threat. Many serpents had fallen as well, and casualties were not few, but the resistance was ready for it.</p><br><p>Now, all the serpents could do was watch the last and most important battle from afar - it would decide their future. Whether or not they could reclaim their lands depended solely on Arnoth's fate.</p><br><p>"It's..." Risha stammered, watching the bright flashes coming from the throne room. "That's not Adam's ability. Arnoth alone is doing all of this?"</p><br><p>Grita nodded weakly, her eyes narrowed. She tried to discern what was happening in the throne room. She wanted to know what their chances were and what they needed to prepare for.</p><br><p>"Yeah, it's Arnoth. That bastard isn't going to give up." Torz confirmed as he glanced down. "Look at what he did to Heret. Damn, hopefully, Adam will avenge our leader.</p><br><p>Next to them lay Vorx and Heret, both unconscious. Each of them did their part, some less, some more.</p><br><p>Grita remained silent. In fact, she was prepared to sacrifice Adam if necessary. She didn't want to do it, but it was the best of the worst options.</p><br><p>Her gaze stopped on the sleeping Heret. 'You lost rather quickly, but Adam continues to fight. That's good. He should win, but... if he loses, that doesn't mean we should accept the same fate.</p><br><p>'By the end of the battle, Arnoth will be exhausted for sure. They've been fighting for quite some time, each taking serious damage now and then. If Arnoth is at the lowest point of his strength, then even if it's with heavy losses, we'll be able to kill him!'</p><br><p>Sure, Grita hoped that a much better and simpler outcome awaited them. She wanted Adam to win and stay alive. But she knew that not everything always went according to plan.</p><br><p>None of them knew that among all the serpents, the Light Legion and the two Phantoms, at the Fallen Ring Castle there was another watcher.</p><br><p>Hygon, as promised to Orel, was keeping a close eye on Risha.</p><br><p>Some time ago, however, his task had come to an end. Risha won her battle, Kreyna would definitely not be able to give her any trouble.</p><br><p>So, he stayed here on his own initiative. He wanted to see how Adam's fight would end, and more than that - he had to make sure that it was actually the end.</p><br><p>'Come on, guy, the sooner you defeat this crusader, the sooner you and you all get back to the tower.'</p><br><p>Could Hygon step out of the shadows and help Adam?</p><br><p>It would take him a few hits to do so. It would be enough for K4-Phantom on the edge of evolution to turn Arnoth into a bloody stain.</p><br><p>But, in reality, Hygon couldn't fight, not here.</p><br><p>If his powerful energy came out, here, at the Fallen Ring Castle, at the place where the black flash appeared, something bad could happen.</p><br><p>It would hardly be a major issue for Hygon, but for the rest, the weak monsters and the two Phantoms, it would be a disaster.</p><br><p>'Tsk, I could have long ago taken Risha and run away, but... I have to give the younger generation a chance to grow and move forward, don't I?' Hygon smirked.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a multitude of bright, white flashes filled the throne room.</p><br><p>Everyone's eyes went wide, hope appeared in the deepest parts. Everyone understood that these were not the colors of Arnoth.</p><br><p>White and purple lines - countless cuts in space were in Adam's possession.</p><br><br><p>Splashes of blood rushed from the dark lines beneath Arnoth's armor. Blood flowed outward in multiple streams, flooding the long-destroyed marble.</p><br><p>Crimson trickles poured into the cracks, crashing in droplets against the flat surface on the first floor.</p><br><p>"Gha...!" Arnoth let out a heavy wheeze as he stepped back.</p><br><p>Neither his shield nor his sword could protect him from Adam's attack.</p><br><p>But his heart continued to beat at its previous pace.</p><br><p>Arnoth knew that if Adam hadn't used this attack before, then he couldn't do it too often.</p><br><p>'He has limitations...' Arnoth thought, feeling the blood run down his arms. 'That's his trump card, he gave away his advantage in return, getting some of my wounds.'</p><br><p>Then, something in Arnoth's posture changed. He nodded his head as if he had heard someone.</p><br><p>Or... Perhaps he was just agreeing with his thoughts?</p><br><p>Without haste, Arnoth raised his head, meeting Adam's cold gaze.</p><br><p>His left hand trembled, but he stopped just at the moment when it might break - a few more swings and his hand would turn into a bloody mess.</p><br><p>"And? What do you plan to do next?" Arnoth waved his hand, dark drops of blood crashing to the floor. "You couldn't destroy my armor or slice my neck. That was your plan, wasn't it?"</p><br><p>With a dim pause, he shook his head.</p><br><p>"It's a shame you couldn't accomplish anything. Hah... I mean it..." he relaxed, his sword and shield pointed to the ground. "You are a hostage to your time and desires. This is your curse, young man. In three months, that attack would lead you to victory... At least, you'd think so."</p><br><p>Adam didn't know what exactly Arnoth was talking about.</p><br><p>Was it praise or an insult?</p><br><p>Making out Arnoth's words was difficult because he was hiding things from Adam that he wasn't supposed to know.</p><br><p>'That's why I have to win, and I'm going to do it right now!'</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam's aura intensified.</p><br><p>A baffled Arnoth lowered his gaze to see a bright star burning in Adam's right eye. He was saving Silvana's strength for this moment.</p><br><p>"You know, you said I shouldn't rely on one ability..."</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"You said it was a big mistake, and I faced the consequences of my decisions. But... I'm ready, no... I want to make that mistake again!"</p><br><p>Now, Arnoth didn't understand what his opponent was talking about.</p><br><p>Soon, he had his answers.</p><br><p>Adam swung his hand, placing a second, smaller needle into the recess on the first needle, perfectly sized.</p><br><p>The darkness and light of his two needles fused as his hands gripped the hilt of his only weapon tightly.</p><br><p>"My true path, my new path, no one has ever seen before. Neither you nor I!"</p>
