            <h4>Chapter 1266: Beetle Chase</h4><br><p>Perhaps Targon was acting like a child, but that wasn’t what Adam was against. Moreover, instead of the difficult or even deadly battles that usually occurred in such situations, Adam received the trials, the most enjoyable ones that were on his path to Phantom.
</p><br><p>Well, at least for him.
</p><br><p>Silvana was constantly on the alert, worrying that something might go wrong for Adam. In this, she was similar to Kara and Toa, who still couldn’t quite accept that Targon actually enjoyed these trials, even though he was a powerful monster.
</p><br><p>Everything eventually came to an end, and the trials at the Glass Bridge were no exception.
</p><br><p>However, before that, he had to pass the last trial, which had already begun.
</p><br><p>Neither Adam nor Silvana knew what was hidden behind the golden firefly, but the rules were simple — Adam had to catch up to the firefly faster than Targon could.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Suddenly, Targon’s great body trembled as he became several times smaller. He did not take his human form, remaining a menacing beast, but now he was only twice as big as Adam.
</p><br><p>If he hadn’t done so, he wouldn’t have been able to compete with Adam on the torn ground, as the beetles were unable to withstand his great weight.
</p><br><p>"Hahaha! Why are you standing there?" Targon laughed. "You had a few seconds to spare while I was transforming, didn’t you? Damn, with that attitude, you’ll never beat me!"
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened as he realized that Targon was right.
</p><br><p>He didn’t need to wait for a countdown or anything like that. With every second, the beetles were getting further and further away, following the golden firefly.
</p><br><p>’Adam, most likely the golden firefly is a special form of energy from some resource growing at the foot of the bridge. Perhaps none of you will make it in time, as the beetles will devour the firefly first.’
</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam jumped off the bridge, jumping onto a crystal beetle as if it were a moving train.
</p><br><p>Targon grinned with a satisfied nod.
</p><br><p>"Hah, he quickly figured out what to do. Alright, Kara, Toa, wait for us, we’ll be back soon!"
</p><br><p>Before the girls could respond, Targon disappeared, reappearing on the beetle next to Adam.
</p><br><p>"What do you say? Can you outrun me?" Targon raised his chin arrogantly, taunting Adam.
</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, watching the golden firefly. It didn’t move particularly fast, maintaining the same pace so that the beetles couldn’t catch up to it, but also so that the distance wouldn’t increase.
</p><br><p>"Why are you talking to me? Don’t you need to hurry?"
</p><br><p>Adam replied as white discs appeared above his hands.
</p><br><p>"Old people are always slower than young people!"
</p><br><p>Without waiting for an answer, Adam threw the threads forward to hook onto the distant beetle. He clenched his hands, pulling himself straight toward the beetle.
</p><br><p>Targon’s smirk widened.
</p><br><p>Halfway there, just as Adam was about to land on the beetle, a shadow flashed to his right.
</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam and Targon exchanged glances as sharp claws easily cut through the silver threads.
</p><br><br><p>Confusion covered Adam’s face, but Targon wasn’t done yet.
</p><br><p>Unafraid of getting cut, he clenched the threads and threw Adam down to the very bottom of the rift.
</p><br><p>Dozens of crystal beetles rushed past him in a single stream while the golden light from the firefly grew farther away with each beat of his heart.
</p><br><p>Countless possibilities rushed through Adam’s mind, hovering around him like fragments reflecting possible versions of the near future.
</p><br><p>At first, he wanted to create new threads. It was easy and didn’t take much energy, but he knew that Targon could easily cut as many threads as he created. The difference influenced this in their strength, and Adam couldn’t change that.
</p><br><p>He could use his new ability or even change the battlefield through the Imaginary Cut. There was also the option of spending a large amount of energy to bounce off the air over and over again.
</p><br><p>But... in the end, Adam settled on something that reflected not his origin or his abilities, but his essence as a Phantom.
</p><br><p>As if completely forgetting his main ability, Adam held out both hands, as if holding an imaginary sword or a needle...
</p><br><p>Targon’s eyes widened as he watched what Adam was about to do first, without realizing it himself.
</p><br><p>Even Silvana was surprised. They had never discussed using this ability in this way. It wasn’t part of their plan.
</p><br><p>However, the path was laid, without a needle, but with Adam’s will. It led straight to the golden firefly. A white tunnel with black floating particles appeared for a moment. That was all it took.
</p><br><p>When Targon realized what was happening, he turned sharply to reach the golden firefly first and stop Adam.
</p><br><p>But, as was often the case when Adam used the path, it was already too late for his opponent.
</p><br><br><p>Adam’s frame trembled as in the next moment he found himself right in front of the golden firefly.
</p><br><p>Ahead, Targon was visible, his massive shadow leaping from one beetle to another. This did not evoke any emotion in Adam, his gaze remained serene as he reached out his hand to the firefly.
</p><br><p>The small creature tried to dodge Adam’s grasp, but soon it was in Adam’s fist. A bright light like stolen sunlight came out of the slits of his fingers as the corners of his mouth lifted upward for a moment.
</p><br><p>Barely audible, he muttered, "Victory..."
</p><br><p>Then, everything went dark as he lost consciousness, sinking deeper into the void, into the dark depths of the rift dividing the two regions.
</p><br><br><p>Targon caught him mid-flight, his other hand holding him from falling as his claws dug deep into the sheer wall.
</p><br><p>"Tsk, kid, what was that?" Targon shook his head. "If you had gotten hurt during my trials, I would have felt terrible. I wouldn’t have had any fun anymore!"
</p><br><p>His eyes looked ahead, watching the dark particles that remained floating where Adam’s path had passed, threatening like black stars, but mysterious and attractive.
</p><br><p>After that, Targon became serious, which was rare for him.
</p><br><p>"You won, and there was a reason for that... After all, sometimes something new appears in this world. Perhaps these changes will be enough?"</p>
