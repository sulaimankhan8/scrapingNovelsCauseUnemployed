            <br><p>Several long minutes passed after the battle. Heret and Vorx glanced around, they weren't sure when they should approach Adam.</p><br><p>Suddenly, an excited female voice came from the side.</p><br><p>"Stop standing still!" Risha exclaimed, her voice shaking. "He's bleeding to death! We have to help him right now!"</p><br><p>Seeing no action from the serpents, Risha rushed forward alone, but after only a few steps, Grita abruptly stopped her.</p><br><p>"What are you doing?!" Risha gritted her teeth angrily.</p><br><p>However, all she saw in response was Grita's calm face.</p><br><p>"Girl, this is their fight. Only Vorx and Heret have the right to decide what should happen next. But, looking at your wet eyes..." Grita shook her head with a bitter smile. "Do you think Adam could die from blood loss?"</p><br><br><p>Risha gulped. "But... They attacked at full force! In the end, Adam lost most of his strength! He suffered many serious wounds."</p><br><p>"Yes, but can't you hear that? You're a Phantom, not a monster, but you should be able to hear his breathing, how his heart beats."</p><br><p>Grita closed her eyes, concentrating on describing to a worried Risha everything in detail.</p><br><p>"It's very slow and heavy, but Adam is breathing. I don't know if he's asleep or just trying to conserve his strength. Either way..." she murmured, afraid to disturb him. "He's alive. If this was a mortal combat, Vorx and Heret would have finished him off by now, but right now, he has nothing to worry about."</p><br><p>However, that was not enough for Risha. She turned to Vorx, wishing she could get help from him at least.</p><br><p>He simply shook his head.</p><br><p>'Khm, that girl, her heart turned out to be much softer than mine,' Vorx thought, glancing at his friend. 'But, panicking right now won't lead to anything good. This guy needs to think hard about what happened.'</p><br><p>Vorx narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>'It was stupid and reckless, Adam. Sometimes it is worth following a plan even if you don't like it.'</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Vorx was absolutely right.</p><br><p>From the beginning of their fight until now, Adam had stuck to the plan, just not their one.</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Countless runes trembled, causing the two main branches of the great tree to bend, pointing their sharp tips toward each other.</p><br><p>Adam watched the scene with a slight smile on his face. After opening the three gates, he knew it would happen sooner or later.</p><br><p>"My two orders... You've been with me for so long," Adam muttered, floating in the darkness.</p><br><p>In a hand sweep, the two streams crashed into each other, shimmering runes shook the darkness, awaiting Adam's decision.</p><br><p>"However, I have no desire to deprive you, but... change must happen. The current me is incapable of helping the serpents and defeating Arnoth, which means I must change."</p><br><p>His blue eyes shone brightly, full of excitement and anticipation.</p><br><p>"A part of me must change!"</p><br><p>Then, Adam crossed his arms, causing the deep darkness to tear into shreds.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree and the familiar inner space appeared before Adam, throwing light onto his face.</p><br><p>It rarely happened, but the Evolution Tree was as silent as Moira and Lone Blaze. No one dared disturb Adam, who was watching one of the most important events in his journey.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Under the unbreakable force of his will, the two main branches broke, moving toward each other. But, soon Adam stopped them.</p><br><p>"No, not like this... I don't know if you will become one or if it will be two new abilities, but each of you must stay in your place, but reach the same peak!" Adam exclaimed, causing the branches to actively grow upwards.</p><br><p>White ripples from a shockwave one after another departed from the Evolution Tree. All the energy from the bark and that lurking inside headed upwards to help the two branches make their hard path.</p><br><p>Many other branches moved aside, making room for the main ones, becoming a majestic crown for the final touch and the bright jewel.</p><br><p>Adam, in awe, watched as the runes ran through the branches, while the two main branches connected with their tips, accumulating all their power in one point.</p><br><p>"Here it is..." Adam whispered, sadness filling his voice, but he couldn't let that feeling ruin everything.</p><br><p>In a lone spark, a white flash covered the entire inner space, even Adam's eyes shone brightly in the real world, but no one noticed it.</p><br><p>At the top of the Evolution Tree, amidst the crown of branches, at the peak of the two intertwined main branches, a large white crystal appeared, perfectly matching the calm darkness around it.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, trying to see what was inside the crystal behind its murky shroud.</p><br><p>Then, shock covered his face, causing joy to flow from the depths as if he saw an old friend even though he had long ago decided that was the last meeting.</p><br><p>The ball of thread floated in a mist, the silver threads quietly moving, wanting to show Adam their two sharp metallic tips.</p><br><p>The first tip was large and rough, the beginning of hard work running the long, almost endless thread.</p><br><p>The second tip was thin and sharp, tiny because it was the end of the road, which is why it could continue further into the unknown.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, wanting to touch the crystal.</p><br><p>[The Branch Crystal had been created.]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree's voice echoed in his mind, mechanical and calm coming from the depths.</p><br><p>Before Adam realized it, he was at the top of his tree as he touched the crystal.</p><br><p>"Hard and cold, but mysterious and indestructible, right?"</p><br><p>Streams of energy full of runes rushed from the crystal, engulfing Adam in its gentle embrace.</p><br><p>The new power was in a hurry to show itself to its owner, to amaze the world and make his heart beat as fast as it did at the beginning.</p><br><p>[The first and second branches joined to create the Branch Crystal.]</p><br><p>That was not the last message of the runes.</p><br><p>[The first and second orders left a legacy.]</p><br><p>Adam smiled faintly, he knew what he would hear next.</p><br><p>[The Branch Order had been created - the Two-Faced Weaver.]</p>
