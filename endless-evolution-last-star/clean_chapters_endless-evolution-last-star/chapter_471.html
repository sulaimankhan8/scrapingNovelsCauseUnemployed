            <br><p>The confrontation between Adam and Dahla had been unexpected, but it had also been quite useful.</p><br><p>Everyone here except Adam and Silvana were familiar with Dahla to some degree, they knew of her caution and reluctance to get involved in dangerous situations.</p><br><p>There was nothing wrong or good about that, it was just a reflection of her background as a surgeon and doctor.</p><br><p>She believed that if a threat could be avoided, it should be done.</p><br><p>Read exclusive content at empire</p><br><p>But, that was a goal Dahla had only adhered to at the beginning of her fiery speech. If Adam would not confront her and respond back, she would continue to press him, trying to get him to change his mind.</p><br><p>In the end, something happened that she couldn't have expected, but... for some strange reason, for Dahla it was the best outcome, no... that's not the right description of the situation, for her it was the most pleasurable outcome.</p><br><br><p>Riska knew the answer to that.</p><br><br><p>Tron put the cup down in the kitchen as he glanced over the broken table.</p><br><p>"Adam and Max follow me." Tron waved his hand walking past Riska and Dahla.</p><br><p>"Sure, boss." Max shrugged nonchalantly, walking forward first.</p><br><p>Adam didn't answer anything, he just followed Max with a slightly sad look. Silvana's gaze darted from side to side, not knowing what she was supposed to do.</p><br><p>The only one who remained calm was Riska.</p><br><br><p>Tron stopped next to Dahla, she was still staring at the floor and breathing frequently. Her sighs were heavy and extended.</p><br><p>Roughly and unceremoniously, Tron's hand fell on Dahla's head, forcing her to meet his menacing gaze.</p><br><p>Though he was a K3-Phantom and she was a K4-Phantom, the power dynamic between them was obvious.</p><br><p>"If you do something like that again, I'll kick you out. We may have different statuses, but for these three months, I'm in charge of the Gray Castle. Do you understand me?"</p><br><p>"Y-Yes..." Dahla said in a trembling voice, but her voice wasn't shaking from fear.</p><br><br><p>Tron nodded and turned around, looking at Riska and Silvana.</p><br><p>"You three, clean this place and then you can watch how the training progresses."</p><br><p>"Sure." Riska nodded with a slight smile.</p><br><p>"I'll help!" Silvana said vigorously.</p><br><p>Then, Tron glanced at Dahla once again. There were a few drops of tea on her face, dripping down her cheeks and leaving a messy and sticky residue because of the large amount of sugar.</p><br><p>With a calm look, Tron pulled a napkin out of his pocket and handed it to her.</p><br><p>"Clean yourself up."</p><br><p>Then, Tron headed forward, Adam and Max were already waiting for him. They were talking about something, but it was only a few short phrases and their voices were quiet so nothing could be heard.</p><br><p>Riska smirked as she watched the look Dahla was giving the departing Tron.</p><br><p>'Your attraction to strong men is dangerous, but I can't blame you.' Riska glanced at Tron, 'Hahaha since I'm the same way.'</p><br><p>"Excuse me, I need to use the restroom." Dahla said before quickly leaving the spectator room.</p><br><p>Riska looked at Silvana with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>"Silvana, as you can see we have a bit of work to do. Adam got angry and had no control over his powers." Riska said pointing to the mess on the floor.</p><br><p>Silvana nodded with a bitter smile.</p><br><p>"Yeah, he's usually calm, but some things can piss him off. I'm glad this one turned out to be intent on keeping his promises."</p><br><br><p>"Ah, it happens. Would you mind helping me out? We need water and some rags, all of which are in the bathroom. I'll clean the glass off the floor for now."</p><br><p>"Sure!" Silvana replied energetically and quickly left the room, not noticing the smirk on Riska's face that she couldn't hide.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Silvana was alone in the restroom.</p><br><p>'Hm? Didn't Dahla go here as well? Well, she's probably gone by now.' Silvana said before walking out with everything she needed to clean up: a bucket of water, a couple of rags, and a mop.</p><br><p>There were two doors leading out of the spectator room, so after exiting one door, she wanted to take a circular walk back to the second door so she wouldn't stop and keep going.</p><br><p>Halfway through her walk, she passed next to a door leading to a technical chamber where she had nothing to do. There was a small window at the top of the sturdy door, through which she could see the far passageway, lit by a few dim bulbs.</p><br><p>There seemed to be nothing of interest there and Silvana walked on, but... something caught her eye that made her take one step back.</p><br><p>Half in the shadows stood a silhouette leaning against the wall.</p><br><p>Looking closer, Silvana realized it was Dahla.</p><br><p>'What? What is she doing here...?' Silvana was baffled.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, she had no more questions, only wide-open eyes and a shocked expression on her face.</p><br><p>Dahla, with a red face and heavy, hot breath was literally sniffing into the napkin that Tron gave her, she hadn't even bothered to use it to remove the traces of tea from her face.</p><br><p>Her thighs were clenched tightly together, her legs rubbing against each other and her eyes rolling with shame and arousal that she couldn't do anything about.</p><br><p>"Tron... Fuck... Fuck... You're weaker, but you're so strong... Agh!"</p><br><p>Silvana gulped as she slowly took a step back, nodded deeply, and headed into the spectator room with a determined stride.</p><br><p>Her gaze became glassy for a while as she pondered on what she saw, this scene wouldn't get out of her head anytime soon. It was one thing to see such things on various websites of suitable subjects, but it was another thing to see it in person and understand why it was happening.</p><br><p>'I see... The calmest, strictest, and strongest one turns out to be a masochist who just breaks down when someone opposes her, be it Adam or Tron... That explains why she didn't argue further with Adam.'</p><br><p>Silvana muttered internally before opening the door.</p><br><p>Looking to the side and seeing Adam in the distance, the scene with Dahla once again appeared in Silvana's mind, making her flinch.</p><br><p>'No... I shouldn't think about that.' Silvana shook her head lifting her gaze to Riska.</p><br><p>"Is something wrong?" Riska asked calmly, sweeping up and putting the shards into one pile.</p><br><p>"No, everything's fine. Let's finish cleaning up quickly."</p><br><p>"Sure." Riska nodded.</p><br><br><p>"So... What's the next phase of training?" Adam asked, scratching the back of his head, he still felt awkward about the past incident. He felt guilty for breaking the table.</p><br><p>Tron smiled slightly looking at Adam.</p><br><p>"Just what you wanted. You're going to fight."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, practically sparkling with anticipation of an interesting battle against Tron.</p><br><p>"Finally! I've wanted to fight you for so long!"</p><br><p>Tron lifted his chin as he grinned slyly.</p><br><p>'Agh...?' Adam was puzzled, he didn't realize what he said wrong.</p><br><p>Then, Tron pointed a thumb at Max, who was standing next to him.</p><br><p>"Not so fast. You have to fight him first."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>Unlike Silvana, he hadn't seen Max fight and even if he did, it wouldn't change his reaction much.</p><br><p>"Wait... He's just a simple man. Is this a joke? Max, no offense, you know."</p><br><p>Max nodded silently.</p><br><p>Tron smirked as he stepped forward.</p><br><p>"Well, that's why we're here." Tron said pointing to this area of the training room.</p><br><p>There were several screens, panels in the walls, and strange platforms on the floor that Silvana had noticed when she first came here.</p><br><p>"You'll enjoy it, Adam, I'm sure. These defeats will be good for you."</p><br>
