            <br><p>"Do you want to buy her some jewelry?" Max asked, glancing at the ring on Adam's finger.</p><br><p>He didn't need to be a mind reader to understand who Adam was talking about and why he wanted to do it. All it took was deduction, logic, and a little mature experience.</p><br><p>Adam nodded, realizing it was impossible to hide anything from Max, but not that it was his goal.</p><br><p>"Yes, Silvana did so many things for me, but in all that time I only gave her a few bags of coffee. It was a success, but I want her to have something that will always remind her of me."</p><br><p>Max smiled slightly, letting a puff of smoke out of his mouth.</p><br><p>"Hah, I see you're looking at rings, but that would be a bad idea, I'd even say that gift would ruin everything."</p><br><p>Adam turned his head sharply towards Max, there was a glint of anxiety in his eyes.</p><br><p>Max shrugged his shoulders.</p><br><p>"Osana gave you a ring, and then you're going to give some kind of ring to Silvana? Come on, that wouldn't just show you have no imagination, it would be insulting."</p><br><p>Adam frowned. He realized Max was right.</p><br><p>"The bracelet, how about the bracelet?" Adam asked when he had an idea.</p><br><br><p>"That's better, much better. But, don't pick something flashy, with a handful of gemstones or made of three different metals. Silvana isn't the kind of woman who would like something like that, that's obvious."</p><br><p>Adam leaned against the wall with a pensive look.</p><br><p>'Yeah... Max is right. A bracelet like that wouldn't suit Silvana, not with her appearance, not with her clothes, not with her personality.'</p><br><br><p>The elevator doors opened as Max stepped outside. He wanted to take a walk before the start of training.</p><br><p>"Oh, don't forget to order cigarettes. You owe me quite a bit, you remember?" Max said with a wave of his hand.</p><br><br><p>"Sure, don't worry, you won't be disappointed. After all, I haven't won once yet."</p><br><br><p>"Well, it's not my fault."</p><br><p>Adam took a few steps forward and stopped in the middle of the hallway, picking out a suitable gift for Silvana.</p><br><p>'Hmm... It should be something simple, yet interesting. It should also show that I really tried and did not just pick the first bracelet I saw.</p><br><p>After a few minutes, Adam realized what might fit his requirements.</p><br><p>After spending some time searching with the AI-helper, Adam was able to quickly find an online store that sold unique custom-made bracelets.</p><br><p>They looked simple, but at the same time were complex constructions consisting of many parts attached to the frame.</p><br><p>In fact, such bracelets were practically a constructor. There was no functionality in them as there was no technology, just quality metal and a well-thought-out design that looked calm and stylish.</p><br><p>And... most importantly.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, the most expensive bracelets from this company were sold as parts. Sure, it doesn't need to be a master to gather them, as the jewelers and engineers made sure that it wasn't difficult, but it would still take some effort.</p><br><p>The advantage of this option was that all parts fit together in any position, which means that each assembled bracelet was truly unique and no one else could have anything similar.</p><br><p>"Damn... The price is a little intimidating.... 125 thousand for a bracelet?" Adam scratched the back of his head, but when Silvana's silhouette appeared in his mind he realized that he needed to get rid of those thoughts as soon as possible.</p><br><p>"Well, if I was having money problems I might have to consider a more budget-friendly option, but now I can just get what I want, can't I?"</p><br><br><p>Adam tapped the screen, and within minutes his order was placed.</p><br><p>Then it was time to go back to his room, where a delicious breakfast prepared by Silvana was waiting for him.</p><br><br><p>'Hmm? Is it just me, or are his eyes glittering like he's up to something?' Silvana pondered watching Adam, who was eating with great appetite whatever she cooked.</p><br><p>Then, Silvana shook her head.</p><br><p>'Never mind, that's not what I should be thinking about right now. Adam's training continues, but I shouldn't fall behind either. Riska...'</p><br><p>Silvana internally muttered as her eyes grew deeper.</p><br><p>'She's the Operator of the K3-Phantom, so I'd rather learn something from her than waste time going through advanced courses in the Fort Norton.'</p><br><p>Silvana nodded, deciding on her plans.</p><br><br><p>The next two weeks continued at a similar pace.</p><br><p>He was constantly fighting against Max and training with heavy weights. Tron would make him train until he was exhausted, then Adam would eat a lot and eat good food and be full of energy again.</p><br><p>Training wasn't as interesting as fighting on the brink of death in the Dead Lands, but for Adam, it was the best way to get stronger, at least for the moment.</p><br><p>His Energy Control was getting better and better, it was still far from perfect, but the results were obvious.</p><br><p>The same was true for the battles against Max.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, Adam was still losing, Max's mastery was too high and was still out of Adam's reach, but he was making significant progress here too.</p><br><p>Ten days later, Max fought with all seriousness and ferocity in each of their battles. Otherwise, he would have lost, so he was giving his best.</p><br><p>Also, the duration of their fights became longer and longer as Adam learned to block attacks, get out of grapples, and react to Max's slick moves.</p><br><p>So, while on the first day of training, Adam had lost more than 30 times, on the fifteenth day he had lost only 7 times.</p><br><p>Sure, it was still only losses, and Max already had a mountain of cigarettes that not even he had time to smoke, but it was obvious that Adam was progressing, and quite quickly.</p><br><p>If the current Adam and the Adam of two weeks ago met in a fight, their battle would be over in a matter of seconds.</p><br><p>Thanks to the Energy Control, Adam had increased his pure power, and his improved mastery made him a more dangerous foe.</p><br><p>But... the Plague Reaper's mastery was still far ahead of Adam's.</p><br><p>It was an opponent he could barely hold on to for a few minutes, using all his abilities and being under three amplifications at once.</p><br><p>However, the gap was closing, and Adam felt that soon he might be able to defeat Max for the first time.</p><br><p>Then, it was the first day in two weeks when something changed in Adam's training.</p><br><p>"Hmm? I'm not fighting anyone today?" Adam tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>Tron shook his head, throwing on his long black coat. He wasn't dressed in a tracksuit today, but more formally.</p><br><p>So was Max, who was getting ready to go out beside him.</p><br><p>"No, Max and I have some things to do today. It is nothing related, it just coincided on the same day, but I knew about it beforehand, so you won't be bored. On the contrary, I'm sure it will be the most useful and informative day for you."</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>Tron smirked as he waved his hand, pointing to Riska, Silvana, and Dahla who were sitting in a room in the training hall.</p><br><p>"They'll explain everything to you."</p><br><p>Then, Tron turned to Max and looked at his NEP.</p><br><p>"Max, let's go, the car should be waiting for us by now."</p><br><p>"Sure, boss." Max shrugged and pulled a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket, brand new with a shiny wrapper.</p><br><br><p>The door closed, and Adam slowly turned around.</p><br><p>Now it was just him, Riska, Silvana and Dahla.</p><br><p>Dahla had a serious face as always, Riska had a kind smile, and Silvana was focused.</p><br><p>Being slightly stumped, Adam slowly approached them and sat down at the table.</p><br><p>He put his hands together and asked:</p><br><p>"So... Is someone going to explain to me what's going on here?"</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, the time has come for you to learn more about K2-Level. I'm sure Silvana has already explained to you that between each level the difference gets bigger, and it takes more and more time to reach the next level."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged as he spread his arms out to the sides.</p><br><p>"Yeah, sure. Also, I heard that K2-Level is something different from K0 and K1, right? I mean, it's supposed to be even harder and even longer, but sooner or later Phantom reaches K3-Level." Find more to read at empire</p><br><p>Dahla smirked as her intense gaze headed towards Adam.</p><br><p>"Well, you're wrong. The point is, if you proceed with caution, take your time, and choose your squads carefully, every Phantom has a possibility of reaching K2-Level."</p><br><br><p>"Sure, in practice it doesn't work out for everyone, some die, and some just give up, but it is possible. However, for many, it's the end of the road."</p><br><p>Adam blinked a few times as his eyes went wide.</p><br><p>Dahla leaned back in her chair as she narrowed her eyes.</p><br><p>"Time, caution, and luck will in no way help you reach K3-Level. Many Phantoms stay at K2-Level forever."</p><br><p>Adam gulped. He realized that after K2-Level, things were getting really tough.</p><br><br><p>"As you realize, it's not about something trivial like genes, essences, or artifacts. All of those can be found without difficulty, and it's not like you'll have any strong need for that type of resource. And... it's not even about something rarer like the Midnight Crystal."</p><br><p>Dahla leaned forward and stared at Adam with a serious look.</p><br><p>"Adam, it's all about the Two Walls."</p><br><br><br><p>Dahla nodded slowly.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you'll have to go through them if you ever want to create the Second Key and make it to K3, but it won't be easy at all."</p>
