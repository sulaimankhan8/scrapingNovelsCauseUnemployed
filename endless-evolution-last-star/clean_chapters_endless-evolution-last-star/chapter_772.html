            <br><br><br><p>[Hurry! The energy... it's heading straight for the pond!]</p><br><p>'Damn! Adam, this is no joke! We can't let the ritual end!'</p><br><p>Neither Lone Blaze nor Silvana knew what was happening in the depths of Adam's inner space. They assumed that he was growing stronger, this was evident in the emergence of dense white energy.</p><br><p>They saw the monsters that had survived Adam's Spirit attack accelerate, channeling their energy into the flames of black rocks.</p><br><p>The red circle quickly filled with bright light, running along the outline and through the black coffin. The energy merged with the remaining trickle of blood that long ago flowed from the dark heart, connecting directly to the pond.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the crimson water in the pond reached its limits, ready to spill over the edge, the same was true for the energy touched the limit.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The serpent statue was shattering into rubble, the old stone unable to withstand the pressure of being too close to the epicenter of all the energy in the temple.</p><br><p>Splashes of blood rose one by one as the stones fell, spilling out beyond the pond.</p><br><p>Just then, Adam slowly opened his eyes, feeling the power running through his body. He didn't know how much stronger he just became, but his instincts told him that guessing was useless, he would only be able to find out for sure during the first fight.</p><br><br><p>Trying to take advantage of his inaction, several of the Vile Believers attacked him, three long spears cutting through the wind aiming straight for Adam's chest.</p><br><p>Deep inside, Adam wanted to dodge, but... for some reason, he didn't see any need to.</p><br><p>White flames shot out in all directions, headed downward in rapid streams, condensing into a single point beneath Adam's will.</p><br><br><p>The three spears stopped abruptly, the Vile Believers hands trembling, they tried to advance further to pierce Adam's chest, yet that goal was out of their reach.</p><br><p>Adam blinked once, revealing his bright, blue eyes, shining like a night sky full of a myriad of eternal stars.</p><br><p>"If you want to fight me... then I'm willing to do it right now. But..."</p><br><br><p>His hand turned into a shadow, a flaming needle sliced the three monsters apart.</p><br><p>"I'm afraid you are too weak to hope to win. That was your mistake."</p><br><p>Twitch. Twitch. Twitch.</p><br><p>The pieces of flesh were trying to regenerate, even burning in the flames they were having some success, the regeneration right next to the pond was at its peak.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes grew deeper as he stretched his arm forward. He didn't need to attack anymore to end their lives for sure.</p><br><p>The white flames disappeared, returning to his inner space, to the Evolution Tree finally ending Adam's evolution, carrying him to the edge of the K2-Level.</p><br><p>His fingers curved slightly as the pure pressure from his aura crashed down on the trembling chunks of flesh.</p><br><p>Distorting the space, the aura smashed the flesh into bloody patches, only dark blobs flying off to the sides trying to escape Adam's wrath.</p><br><p>Then, Adam heard a voice filled with despair:</p><br><p>[Adam... The ritual is complete... We lost...]</p><br><p>Adam shook his head, his expression hadn't changed a bit.</p><br><p>"No, it would happen in any case. If it wasn't the monsters that did it, the energy of the bloody river would be enough. With all my abilities and new power... I wouldn't be able to dry up the river fast enough."</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, she agreed with Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>'But... Adam, the monsters took advantage of your inaction. They finished the ritual, perhaps..... if you had killed them, there wouldn't have been enough energy.'</p><br><p>"You're wrong." he said sternly, "Silvana... You have no idea how dense the energy is here. Just by wave, I can feel it enveloping my hand."</p><br><p>Adam looked around at the monsters retreating to the edges of the temple, their mission was complete. Now, there was nothing they could do to Adam.</p><br><p>"As a last resort, they would sacrifice themselves, so it was inevitable."</p><br><br><p>Lone Blaze's shout pierced Adam's head, but he remained calm.</p><br><p>"Why? When I made the pact with you I pledged to rid you of the fear in the depths of the fortress. Only by destroying its source can you breathe a sigh of relief."</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, the flames from Lone Blaze covering his needle and legs growing powerful and lighter, gaining some of the momentum from his snow-white energy.</p><br><p>"Don't worry. I'll do what I promised. You can be sure of that."</p><br><p>Ripple. Ripple. Ripple.</p><br><p>The surface of the pond trembled, the last piece of the statue disappearing into its depths. The bloody stream headed slightly upward as if something or someone was trying to get out of its shell.</p><br><p>With a splash of blood, a broad gray wing, something between a bat and dragon wing, emerged. It was devoid of feathers, covered in stretched webbed skin, under a slight curve, ending in three sharp claws pointing down.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>With the appearance of that wing, the pressure intensified. Some of the monsters that didn't get far enough away collapsed to the ground.</p><br><p>He expected the second wing to show itself soon, but... it didn't.</p><br><br><p>At a smooth angle, as if someone was pulling on a thread, a silhouette slightly taller than Adam showed up from the pond.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam realized that his opponent was a Crown Type Monster.</p><br><p>'As always...' he muttered to himself.</p><br><p>Slowly, thick blood dripped off the silhouette, it stood confidently on the fluctuating surface of the pond.</p><br><p>The black and red robes were the first to show, a mixture of thick, tight leather and spacious pieces of cloth, especially around the wrists and shoulders.</p><br><p>The garments looked luxurious like a royal person from ancient times, but were not flashy, their purpose was to show status and power rather than bloated wealth.</p><br><p>A long purple snake ran along the chest of the silhouette, leaving its head on its shoulder, the snake's amber eyes instilled fear and terror, gazing at any creature as its victim.</p><br><p>The silhouette's pale skin was revealed last, its blond disheveled hair reaching to the level of its chin and its slightly opened crimson eyes shining like bloody rubies.</p><br><br><p>A lone wing spread out in full force, sending aggressive currents of wind roaming throughout the temple.</p><br><p>Adam's hair tips rippled, that movement alone was enough for the random wind currents to kill the weakest monsters who didn't manage to hide behind the pillars.</p><br><p>"Silvana, who is it?"</p><br><p>Then, for the first time, Adam heard something new from her, her voice full of fear:</p><br><p>'I don't know... This monster had never been seen before."</p><br><p>Soon, a second voice, not Adam's, deep and majestic, reached the temple walls:</p><br><br><p>The silhouette pointed at Adam.</p><br><p>"Who are you? Are you my servant...?"</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, the monster could talk, no monster that Adam faced before was capable of it, just heavy sighs, roars, and grunts, no coherent human speech.</p><br><p>But... even more shocked was Silvana.</p><br><p>Panic rapidly engulfed her soul, as her breathing became intermittent.</p><br><p>The reason was simple - it wasn't a Crown Type monster in front of Adam.</p><br><p>It was the Overlord Type.</p>
