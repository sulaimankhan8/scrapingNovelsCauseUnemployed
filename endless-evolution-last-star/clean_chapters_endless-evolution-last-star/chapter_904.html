            <br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide at Reinz's words. Despite being an Operator, she didn't know about the very top of the higher nobles. It was information beyond her grasp.</p><br><p>Only when she and Adam reach K4-Level would she perhaps have a way to learn about people like the head of the Alderran Family?</p><br><p>Well, Reinz wasn't an Operator, but he was a member of that family and the high noble so he was aware of a lot of things due to his status - by birthright.</p><br><p>"Wait..." Silvana gulped, "Are you saying that the Second Circle is not the limit? Is Damien or anyone else on the Third Circle?"</p><br><p>Baffled, Reinz looked uncertainly at Silvana, he didn't know how to answer her so as not to tell her too much. After all, even the elders had to pay attention to what they said.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam came to his rescue, he understood everything.</p><br><p>"Calm down, Silvana, I think it's obvious here."</p><br><p>Silvana turned in his direction.</p><br><p>"Agh? What do you mean?"</p><br><p>"Well..." Adam shrugged, "Apparently, there are pretty few of the Second Rank Phantoms in the Citadel, and they're all special people or heads of great families/organizations. The path from the First Circle to the Second Circle is so complicated that out of tens of thousands of Phantoms, only a few could make it, isn't it?"</p><br><p>In response, Reinz only nodded weakly.</p><br><p>"So, not all Phantoms of the First Circle are equal." Adam smiled bitterly, "The difference between K0 and K4 Phantoms is monstrous, so I guess at the Second Circl,e there is also some dividing line between people like the head of the Alderran Family and Damien."</p><br><p>Though Reinz said nothing, it was obvious from his look and gestures that Adam was right. He might have been wrong about some of the details, but he immediately understood what Reinz was trying to say in answer to his earlier question.</p><br><br><p>Adam stood up from the table, beckoned Silvana over, and walked over to Reinz. His hand fell on Reinz's shoulder and clapped several times approvingly.</p><br><p>"You are a great guy Reinz, I don't know if praise from a commoner out of the slums is worth something to you, but I say it sincerely."</p><br><p>Reinz didn't answer anything, but he couldn't hold back the bitter smile that covered his face.</p><br><p>Before leaving, Silvana turned around looking at the almost untouched pancakes and unfinished tea with a slight sadness.</p><br><p>'Let's go.' Adam whispered in her ear, 'This time the meal is more than just food - it's healing through conversation.'</p><br><p>Before Silvana could realize what Adam meant, he put his arm around her shoulder and disappeared down the aisle.</p><br><p>A few minutes later, Reinz was still where he was - sitting alone in the kitchen.</p><br><p>It seemed like it was time to leave, but instead, he picked up his knife and fork, slowly cutting a slice off a pancake.</p><br><p>Honey fell in thick drops from the edges smashing against the surface of the plate.</p><br><br><p>Reinz took a deep breath as he swallowed a bite.</p><br><br><p>Then, he proceeded to the rest, intending to eat at least his portion.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Chloe was hitting the middle of a special dummy - its material changed color depending on the strength of the blow. In this way, Erik wanted Chloe to improve her control over her energy. Silvana had gone through this stage in the morning.</p><br><p>It seemed that Silvana and Chloe were going through the same training as their Phantoms, but that was not the case. The most important thing Silvana and Chloe had to learn at this stage was how to use energy more efficiently than controlling it.</p><br><p>All of their energy came from their Phantoms and was linked to their Evolution Trees. However, their abilities were theirs. Adam could activate the Stellar Resonance at any time, but how long it would take was largely up to Silvana, because the power flowed from her.</p><br><p>In this case, Chloe and Silvana were like a rich man's financier. The financier did not earn the money, but it was his task to effectively distribute and spend it. In the end, he got his well-deserved paycheck for doing so.</p><br><br><p>Chloe delivered several seemingly identical blows using energy. However, twice the dummy's chest turned red and once blue. She needed it to turn blue three times in a row. She was close to that, but she couldn't achieve it yet.</p><br><p>What were Erik and Julia doing in the meantime?</p><br><p>Well, they were enjoying the entertainment. Erik's phone showed the entire conversation between Adam, Silvana, and Reinz, in good quality and sound.</p><br><p>Julia put her hands on his shoulder, watching Reinz alone eating cold pancakes, then he went to wash the dishes. Who knows, maybe for a high nobleman it was the first time in his life.</p><br><p>"You know it's illegal, right?" she glanced at him.</p><br><p>"Hah." Erik chuckled evilly, "Maybe you'll sue me then?"</p><br><p>"No... I'm the one who installed the cameras, right? In that case, I'd be setting myself up, wouldn't I?"</p><br><p>She narrowed her eyes into slits.</p><br><p>"So, after those two fools are trained in the Infusive Energy Control, then you'll actually fulfill their wishes?"</p><br><p>"Sure, you know that - I, Erik Wurhen, always keep my word. Do you think it will be a problem for us to send Reinz to the Void Lake? It's a matter of minutes."</p><br><p>"Yeah... but... it's not him I'm worried about." Julia muttered, her eyes growing darker, "The Lower Ring? Adam goes there because of Aiden Henk and as far as I know he's been contacted several times by Wilfred, the head of the Black Swan. It's been a long time for Adam, but for those two... not even a year has passed... for them it's like a couple weeks of waiting and watching."</p><br><p>Suddenly, the slight smile on Erik's face became a sly smirk, a dangerous gleam running across his eyes.</p><br><p>"Aiden Henk and Wilfred? Hah, those two want the same thing but think differently. But... Even I don't know why they want Adam.</p><br><br><p>"It's nice not to know something. It's so intriguing!"</p>
