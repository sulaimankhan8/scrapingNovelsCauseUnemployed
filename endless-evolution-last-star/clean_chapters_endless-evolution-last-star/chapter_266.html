            <br><p>Crown Types were the worst opponents if Phantom needed to fight in close combat and it was a 1 vs. 1.</p><br><p>Crown Monsters were dangerous not only with their mastery, but also with their weapons because unlike many monsters their weapons were not fangs or claws, but something more serious: a sword, a spear, or even a katana like Snow Follower.</p><br><p>The weapons of the Crown Monster were an important part of its power, the same Steel Knight wouldn't have been so dangerous if it wasn't for his two massive swords that almost managed to end Adam's life. He was really close to it.</p><br><p>So... If the Crown Monster deliberately didn't use his weapons in battle, it could only mean one thing - he didn't consider his enemy worthy.</p><br><p>Nessa found herself in that exact position, but she was willing to show Snow Follower that it was a big mistake on his part.</p><br><p>However... The start of the fight was not on her.</p><br><br><p>Snow Follower's fist plunged repeatedly into Nessa's stomach, causing her eyes to go wide with bright pain and her whole body to shake as she struggled to absorb the incoming damage.</p><br><br><p>Nessa grabbed Snow Follower's wrist tightly, stopping the monster's fist just before it was about to reach its target.</p><br><p>Snow Follower tilted his head slightly, looking at her puzzled before running forward harshly.</p><br><p>'What...? What the fuck is he doing...?' Nessa thought being under Snow Follower's calm gaze.</p><br><p>Nessa tensed her legs trying to slow Snow Follower's stride, and gradually she succeeded, leaving long trails on the ground.</p><br><p>However... Snow Follower wasn't so stupid as to let her make her own rules during the fight.</p><br><p>Snow Follower, holding Nessa by the hair lifted her up, using his long joints and the difference in their height so that her feet no longer touched the ground.</p><br><p>Then, Snow Follower took a step to the left, turned his body, and pulled Nessa to the right.</p><br><p>Nessa quickly tried to figure out how to get out of the grip, because as long as Snow Follower held her by the hair, she was like a punching bag to him.</p><br><p>'Agh...?' Nessa blinked in confusion, for before she could do anything, Snow Follower released her hair.</p><br><br><p>Snow Follower stepped forward confidently and leaned his body.</p><br><br><p>Snow Follower's fist, with a whistle of wind, slammed into Nessa's face, throwing her dozens of meters back.</p><br><br><p>A stream of blood rushed from Nessa's mouth as she collided with the wall before falling to the ground.</p><br><p>"Hey, what are you up to?" Adam narrowed his eyes, staring intently at Magnus with obvious skepticism of his actions.</p><br><p>"What do you mean?" Magnus nonchalantly replied.</p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily transferring his gaze to Nessa who was trying to get up off the ground.</p><br><p>"According to her, her max is the strongest of the Blue Threat Level and common monsters of the Purple Threat Level. I exchanged a few blows with her and can confirm that it's true. However, a Top-9 Crown Monster, that's not her level." Adam said seriously.</p><br><p>Magnus nodded, he rested his cheek on his hand, watching the fight as if it were a theatrical performance.</p><br><p>"Don't forget that Nessa is not human. She's a hybrid, human and monster. Monsters and beasts are similar in their habits, so... a beast becomes truly terrifying when it finds itself in a desperate situation. Just give her time and she'll show what her body can do."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, he didn't believe in Nessa's success. It wasn't that he had anything against Nessa or disliked her, no, it was his as an evaluation of someone who had defeated several Top-10 monsters.</p><br><p>And... He had enough competence for his words to be taken seriously.</p><br><p>"Shit... That wasn't bad. At one point I thought my skull was going to explode." Nessa spit up a clot of blood, wiping the blood flowing from her nose.</p><br><p>Nessa smirked confidently, rose from the ground, and turned to Snow Follower with a look filled with the flames of battle, ready to continue the fight.</p><br><p>But... her opponent didn't share her enthusiasm.</p><br><p>"What the fuck...?" Nessa muttered confusedly.</p><br><p>Snow Follower didn't look at her, he turned away and directed his gaze in the other direction to Adam, who was far away and high up.</p><br><p>Then, Snow Follower pointed at Nessa, waved his hand squeamishly like a disgruntled child, and moved his hand to Adam before poking himself in the chest.</p><br><p>Snow Follower couldn't talk, but in this case, words weren't necessary. Everyone understood what he was trying to convey.</p><br><p>'How strange... This monster is different from many, even among the Crown Type...' Silvana internally muttered, shifting her gaze from the monster to Adam.</p><br><p>'He's willing to give Nessa more time to get stronger, otherwise, he would have already killed her... but he still wants to fight someone and Adam would be the perfect candidate for him. But... will Adam agree?' Silvana pondered, feeling slightly nervous.</p><br><p>She wanted to start biting her nails out of habit again.</p><br><p>In response to Snow Follower's suggestion, Adam only shook his head, giving his firm refusal. Then, he serenely looked away, as if to show that Snow Follower was missing something really important.</p><br><br><p>Snow Follower was puzzled as he tilted his head.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a fist slammed into Snow Follower's face, causing it to distort. In a heartbeat, Snow Follower's jaw was knocked out, and he was launched into flight.</p><br><p>"Bastard! If you decided to fight me then stop disrespecting me! You think I'm not worthy of your attention?! That's not how it works!" Nessa exclaimed furiously before she sprinted forward at her extreme speed.</p><br><p>"Oh... I think I'm starting to see what you were talking about..." Adam muttered, amazed at the sight that unfolded before him.</p><br><p>Envy began to brew within him once again.</p><br><p>After Snow Follower had knocked her to the ground with a series of crushing blows and didn't even pay attention to her, Nessa began to attack with a renewed vigor that everyone could see.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes traveled over Nessa's body with interest, watching her muscles that responded to their owner's call.</p><br><p>The muscles grew tighter, seeming to twist around each other like steel threads allowing them to release and withstand power beyond Nessa's limits.</p><br><br><p>Before Snow Follower could reach the wall, Nessa caught up with him, and like a wrestler lifted him above her, gripping his legs tightly and throwing her arm over his neck in an attempt to completely block his movements.</p><br><p>Then, Nessa clenched her teeth tightly, streams of steam seemed to rush from her mouth and her arms tensed to the limit.</p><br><p>Snow Follower's body arched slightly under the insane pressure that Nessa was applying before throwing Snow Follower across herself forward, simultaneously plunging her knee straight into Snow Follower's spine.</p><br><p>There was a loud crack from breaking bones that filled the room like a deadly echo.</p><br><p>Silvana gasped in horror, covering her mouth with her palm. Magnus grinned contentedly, and Adam's eyes went wide for a moment, he was clearly impressed.</p><br><p>Then, for the first time in their fight, Snow Follower's gaze filled with savage pain... but, was this the end for someone who loved to fight?</p><br><p>Well, for Crown Type, it was a call to action to fight for their lives like they always did.</p>
