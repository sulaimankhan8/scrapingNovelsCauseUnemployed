            <br><p>The rebellion had begun, but Heret didn't want Arnoth and Kreyna to find out about it any faster than his allies. The Serpent Folk waited for him to signal from the scarlet cliff, expecting him and his men to deal with the Light Legion Squad.</p><br><p>For this, Heret gave everyone instructions - they should not use abilities or even energy on too great a scale.</p><br><p>Arnoth might not have paid much attention to it, but Kreyna noticed everything. Her goal was to make sure that the Fallen Ring Castle was under their complete control, at least while they were lords here.</p><br><br><p>Jumping out of the shadows, Heret appeared next to a Light Knight, in a sudden motion, grabbing his head and breaking his neck.</p><br><p>With a thud, a Light Knight crumbled to the ground under the shocked stares of his comrades.</p><br><p>But, before they could react, sharp claws pierced their necks like dozens of blades. Each serpent chose his victim, and not a single soldier could last more than five seconds.</p><br><p>The only ones left alive were the two knights. However, a similar fate to the others awaited them.</p><br><p>Adam emerged behind them, his arms raised up, barely reaching their broad shoulders. The Light Knights were quite tall, over two meters, and the heavy armor made them even bigger.</p><br><p>Then, he pressed down on their shoulders, crumpling the sturdy armor. Under the pressure, the Light Knights' knees collapsed to the ground.</p><br><p>"That's it, guys." Adam hissed coldly.</p><br><br><p>His fists, like hammers, came down on the Light Knights' heads, crushing their helmets. Streams of blood rushed through the slits and gapes in their helmets, flooding the ground in crimson bursts.</p><br><p>Thus, in less than a minute, the Light Legion Squad was defeated.</p><br><p>No one said anything, a dead silence hovering over the scarlet cliff.</p><br><p>Making sure all the knights were dead, Heret nodded deeply and walked to the very edge of the cliff, dragging one knight behind him.</p><br><p>His fangs tore through the protective plates on his back, sinking into the knight's flesh - absorbing blood, energy, and strength.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment, he didn't know Heret could do that. Though, it wasn't really any different from normal energy absorption, all monsters could do that.</p><br><p>It was just that Heret was going to use this power right now without directing it into his body.</p><br><br><p>Debris broke off the cliff under his heavy step, as his silhouette loomed over all of the Fallen Ring Castle.</p><br><p>Then, he raised his right hand high, covered in blood, summoning his ominous, green flame.</p><br><p>A few sparks were enough for the active flame to run up his arm, bursting out in a powerful surge to the very top.</p><br><p>The fiery sphere spiraled over the scarlet cliff for only a few moments before exploding in a deafening blast.</p><br><p>Everyone, without exception, noticed it, every member of the resistance, the common serpent living under the oppression of the Light Legion, the knights, and soldiers, as well as Kreyna and Arnoth.</p><br><p>At the same moment, on the borders of the Fallen Ring Castle, dozens of bright flashes unfolded.</p><br><p>Members of the resistance transformed into great serpents, unannounced, unleashing their blazes and tails upon the patrolling Light Legion squads.</p><br><p>The streets and many houses wouldn't be able to stand after the revolt, but that was a price serpents, Vorx, Heret and everyone else was willing to pay.</p><br><p>"If we win, we'll rebuild everything, better than it was before!"</p><br><p>Heret clenched his fists tightly as he watched the first squads work, in the distance he spotted Torz and Grita running amongst the streets in their human forms.</p><br><p>"If we let Arnoth and Kreyna continue to destroy our legacy, what we've been able to accomplish thanks to the King and Queen... Soon we'll have nothing left!"</p><br><p>Then, Heret turned to Adam.</p><br><p>"Move on as planned - first to the main square, then to the bridge leading directly to the throne hall. Leave the first floor of the castle to Vorx and Risha. It is their job to deal with Kreyna."</p><br><p>A cold gleam ran across Adam's blue eyes, his aura trembling, distorting the space around him like a calm beast starving with anticipation.</p><br><p>"Sure... Let's go fight. Each for his own goals, thus we'll help each other in the end."</p><br><p>Without further ado, Adam and Heret twitched, jumping down the slope.</p><br><p>The other serpents exchanged glances and nodded to each other. They had another task, to join the resistance and help their people move from the castle's borders.</p><br><br><br><p>Cold streams of wind blew around Adam's face in their speedy descent to the lowest point.</p><br><p>The resistance would gradually surround the castle, starting its way from the borders and taking over one tower after another. Eventually, when the Fang Spire, the Tail Spire, and all the towers were under their control, all the Light Legion soldiers would have to gather at one point - at the castle.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Heret smashed to the ground, not far from the lava circle.</p><br><p>The shockwave receded from their fall, as a slight shiver ran down their legs.</p><br><p>Adam glanced up, looking up at the scarlet cliff. 'Damn, if it were a little higher, it would be like falling from the top of a skyscraper. I knew my body could take it, but... I thought the recoil would be stronger.'</p><br><br><p>Heret touched his shoulder as green flames covered his hands.</p><br><p>"Go ahead, we must kill every single Light Legion warrior on the path, but we don't stop to help anyone. We must act quickly and sharply."</p><br><p>"Sure..." Adam nodded deeply, watching the raging shadows in the distance. The great serpents were burning and destroying everything around them, light projectiles and blades raining down on them, but their scales were tough enough.</p><br><p>Dense energy, the white flames covered Adam's legs as they tore from the ground.</p><br><p>In only ten seconds, they were at the first one-ring tower, seeing several of the Light Soldiers fighting against the serpents in a human form.</p><br><p>The serpents were trying to hold back the onslaught, but they were outnumbered, soon they would have to retreat or suffer heavy casualties.</p><br><br><p>One serpent's eyes went wide as Adam and Heret swept between them.</p><br><p>Two flashes, white and green, tore the weak S2 monsters apart, leaving only corpses in bloody armor behind them.</p><br><p>Nothing could stop their path.</p>
