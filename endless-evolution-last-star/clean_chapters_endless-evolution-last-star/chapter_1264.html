            <h4>Chapter 1264: Targon, the Crystal Beast (Part 2)</h4><br><p>Like Silvana, Adam decided that Targon was a monster who had grown bored of staying in one place all the time.
</p><br><p>They were able to confirm this when Targon himself said so.
</p><br><p>His goal was to have fun, which was not surprising given his situation.
</p><br><p>In fact, Targon was not unique. There were quite a few similar monsters in different places, but this was the first time Adam had traveled to such distant lands.
</p><br><p>Saegar and Kenward would be good examples, but they both had things to do every day, especially Saegar, because the lives of hundreds of monsters and a large territory depended on him.
</p><br><p>In the deep parts of the Tarnished Lands, and even more so in the Dark Shores, it was not uncommon to encounter monsters who had some kind of job or position.
</p><br><p>Sure, it had to be a strong, intelligent monster, but given their numbers and lifespan, that was not a problem.
</p><br><p>Thus, Adam was willing to entertain Targon if it was necessary to get to the Forgotten Mills, where the Connected Heart awaited him.
</p><br><p>Adam saw nothing wrong with going through ’harmless’ trials if that was what Targon wanted.
</p><br><p>But... he was sorely mistaken about the ’harmless’ part.
</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.
</p><br><p>Like a stone thrown into a lake, Adam bounced off the surface, unable to stop the momentum propelling him forward.
</p><br><p>Only after several hundred meters did his back hit the crystal floor, while two streams of blood flowed from his nose and the corner of his mouth.
</p><br><p>"Fuck..." Adam muttered hoarsely, staring at the bright sun towering above him. "So that’s what he meant by fun. Damn beast, does he even know that I have a battle ahead of me as well?"
</p><br><p>"Adam!" Silvana exclaimed as she was about to rush to his aid, but a voice behind her stopped her.
</p><br><p>"Don’t worry, he’s fine." Targon waved his hand dismissively. "He has a strong body, I would even say too strong for his level. Hah, humans, you can be dangerous!"
</p><br><p>Kara and Toa flinched, knowing that Targon was not joking.
</p><br><p>If they had received such a blow, they would already be dead, but Adam easily got to his feet.
</p><br><p>He did not rush, and Targon did not hurry him, patiently waiting for Adam to return.
</p><br><p>"And? What now?" Adam brushed the blood from his mouth.
</p><br><p>In response, Targon smirked, raising his fist again.
</p><br><p>"One more time. If you can’t stand up or land on your feet, then we have nothing to talk about."
</p><br><p>"Tsk, now it’s turned into a contest of strength? Is that all the trials your imagination could come up with?"
</p><br><br><p>"Of course not! But I’m not going to play with weaklings. Kara and Toa couldn’t do it, so I have to look for other options."
</p><br><br><p>Before Targon could finish, Adam attacked again.
</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Targon’s gaze dropped to Adam’s fist touching his.
</p><br><p>Unlike the first time, when Adam gathered as much energy as he could in one point to deliver the strongest blow possible, now he didn’t even tense his muscles.
</p><br><p>He realized that Targon had tricked him. Targon wanted to test his durability, not his strength, so wasting energy on another mighty punch was pointless.
</p><br><p>"Hah, you’re pretty smart... Well, let’s see if you can figure out how to pass my trial!"
</p><br><br><p>Targon’s second punch was just as fast as the first, but this time Adam was ready.
</p><br><p>He put up a block in advance, condensing energy in front of him.
</p><br><p>Sure, it wasn’t enough to completely negate the entire impact, but it wasn’t as bad as last time.
</p><br><br><p>The strike threw Adam high into the air. He couldn’t stay in one spot, but that wasn’t the only condition for passing the first trial.
</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam gathered energy beneath him, creating a soft cushion that prevented his back from touching the surface.
</p><br><br><p>Adam slowly got to his feet, looking at Targon with the confident gaze of a winner.
</p><br><p>He knew he had outsmarted Targon.
</p><br><br><br><p>Targon slowly clapped his hands, expressing his admiration.
</p><br><p>"Not bad. You knew you couldn’t block all of my power. Hah, looks like you’re one of those without defensive abilities, right?"
</p><br><p>Adam remembered his threads, but nodded.
</p><br><p>"Yes, something like that." He shrugged as he approached Targon. "What now? I understand this wasn’t the last trial?"
</p><br><p>Targon touched his chin, thinking. He had many options, he had to decide what would be best for Adam.
</p><br><p>Then, Targon grinned.
</p><br><p>"Your durability and strength are excellent, but what about your speed and reaction time?"
</p><br><br><p>Targon slammed both fists onto the bridge, causing the runes on the surface to glow brightly.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, a crystal platform about a meter high appeared between him and Adam so that Adam would be comfortable too.
</p><br><p>The platform had exactly six round holes the size of a head.
</p><br><p>Soon, a light flashed in one of the holes as a ghost with red eyes appeared.
</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Targon’s fist slammed into the ghost, forcing it back into the platform.
</p><br><p>Several bursts of energy escaped, forming a bright star for a few seconds—confirming that Targon had managed to strike the ghost before it could hide.
</p><br><p>Adam blinked several times in disbelief. He was sure he had seen similar entertainment in arcade rooms in various bars.
</p><br><p>This was not what he expected to encounter in the middle of the Tarnished Lands, at the point dividing two large regions.
</p><br><p>"What do you say, Adam, intrigued? Toa, you’ll keep score."
</p><br><p>"Yes!" Toa replied instantly.
</p><br><p>Silvana crossed her arms over her chest.
</p><br><p>"What about weapons? According to the rules, players must have a hammer, right? Your hands are big and heavy enough, you don’t need one, but Adam could use a hammer."
</p><br><br><p>"Of course! You read my mind. Hah, Silvana, you have once again proven that you are a good Operator!"
</p><br><br><p>Targon tapped the bridge, and a multitude of crystals grew in front of Adam, gradually turning into a rough hammer with a long handle.
</p><br><br><p>Adam grinned and grabbed the hammer with both hands.
</p><br><p>"Sure, let’s get started!"</p>
