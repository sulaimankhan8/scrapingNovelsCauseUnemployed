            <br><p>After listening to Orel, Adam realized that he was lucky to be born in the Upper Ring.</p><br><p>He was a Natural Phantom, and deep inside he was proud of it and glad that on that very day, he managed to kill a monster and survive. That was the beginning of everything. But, at the Lower Ring, there was nothing special about it, everyone here was a Natural Phantom, just a Phantom, and had gone through a fate similar to his.</p><br><p>But, to a greater extent he was thinking about Silvana and their relationship. At the Lower Ring he would have to find himself an Operator, going through several girls, whether they were candidates or not didn't matter. They both agreed that they wouldn't be able to make contact the first time they met.</p><br><p>Perhaps, using the method Orel had described, Adam and Silvana could become a solid couple, they would match and Silvana would change for him.</p><br><p>However, that was no guarantee. No one knew what would happen in such a scenario. Maybe the way of the Lower Ring would work for them, or Adam's energy would only hurt Silvana as it had with Orel and his first Operator.</p><br><p>Adam folded his hands together, staring at the floor.</p><br><p>'Hm... I have to admit that I probably wouldn't have found my Operator like Orel until the third or fourth try. Maybe I'd need even more, who knows?'</p><br><p>Then, he glanced at Silvana who, like him, was immersed in thought.</p><br><p>'Apparently, I would have a different Operator if I was born at the Lower Ring. I won't hide it, I'd be curious to see an alternative version of myself. But...' he admired Silvana's pensive face. 'I wouldn't give up what I have for anything.'</p><br><p>A few minutes passed in silence under the occasional crunch of chips and sips of beer until Silvana looked up with eyes sparkling with curiosity staring at Misa.</p><br><p>"Misa, I realize that at the Lower Ring, there is no government, the forts, and so on but the Operators do their jobs somehow, right?"</p><br><p>She waved her hand. "I mean, even though most Operators enter this path at the K2-Level, because of the specifics of the Lower Ring, you pass through very quickly, even if in a harsh way. So, doesn't anyone train you? You should know how to behave, help your Phantom, and so on."</p><br><p>Orel and Risha stared at Misa.</p><br><p>"Well, although the government doesn't want to show itself much at the Lower Ring when you're the Operator of the K2-Phantom, it becomes much easier to contact them. They can provide some assistance."</p><br><p>"But..." she drummed on the table. "It's mostly help from the more experienced Operators you have the opportunity to speak to."</p><br><p>Slowly, Misa's hand traveled over Orel's shoulder moving along his back.</p><br><p>"When I became Orel's Operator he was at the K2-Level. Obviously, at the Red Bears, it was far from peak strength. So I consulted and learned from the Operators of the K3 and K4 Phantoms from here."</p><br><p>A slight smile showed on Orel's face. He was pleased with her answer.</p><br><p>Adam chuckled briefly.</p><br><p>"Yeah, Orel, I share your smile. It may have been a difficult path, but you've found your Operator."</p><br><p>"Hah, Adam, you're like a child in front of me," Orel grinned but raised the can of beer like a wine glass in appreciation. "Thanks."</p><br><p>Then, Adam looked at Risha who for most of the conversation silently ate snacks, except for a few moments.</p><br><p>"By the way... Orel said your Operator wears a collar. So, even though you're a K3-Phantom, you're still at the Discord stage, right?"</p><br><p>Risha froze as if petrified.</p><br><p>"But, how is that possible? You should have reached the Harmony Stage at the K2-Level or split up, isn't that right?"</p><br><p>Silvana looked at Orel, expecting him to explain everything as before, but his whole appearance showed that he had no intention of doing so. He watched Risha silently, gloom filling his gaze.</p><br><p>Knowing more than the others, Misa touched Risha, stroking her shoulder. "It's alright. If you don't want to you don't have to answer."</p><br><p>She looked at Adam and Silvana.</p><br><p>"I'm sure they can understand you."</p><br><p>'Agh? Did I ask for the wrong thing?' Adam thought, lost.</p><br><p>"No, it's fine..." Risha shook her head before finishing the can of beer in one go even though it was half full.</p><br><p>"Fuck..." she tossed the can aside hiccupping. "Misa's right, I don't really want to talk about it but... I owe you."</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><br><p>She nodded. "Yeah, you didn't kill me, even though I lost. I mean, you wanted to do it, but I'm alive so consider it my payback."</p><br><p>With a long pause, Risha gulped as her face darkened.</p><br><p>"The thing is, two months ago, my previous Operator died. After that happened, I wanted nothing more than to booze. I went to bars, and nightclubs ate, drank, and fucked anything that moved. I didn't care, I just wanted to take my pain away."</p><br><p>After a heavy sigh, Risha continued.</p><br><p>"This isn't the first time I've lost someone I knew personally. At the Lower Ring, it's not uncommon, especially when you're a Four Beasts member.</p><br><br><p>She turned to Adam, her eyes glazed over ready to burst into a flood of tears consisting of nothing but grief and pain.</p><br><p>"To lose an Operator? It's the worst thing you can imagine... It hurts not only me, but my Evolution Tree because he was part of my inner space, he became part of me, but... he's gone, and that can't change."</p><br><p>Then, a slight smile, and a glimpse of happiness appeared on her face. The tragedy was recent, but she had no right to sink to rock bottom. Life went on.</p><br><p>"Glen, my new Operator up until this point had been a simple waiter. After a few orders and three bottles of whiskey, he realized something was wrong with me... We ended up going to a hotel, I fucked him and made him mine. Something like that..."</p>
