            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1100: World Wipe (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Few Phantoms, let alone ordinary people, knew about the existence of the First Star. For everyone else, the Last Star was just a legend created for one purpose—to explain the origin of their world, where energy came from, where monsters came from, and most importantly, where Phantoms came from.</p><br><p>Some believed that the Last Star existed, others did not. It was not that important, as it was all just theory.</p><br><p>Only the highest members of the government and the K4-Phantoms had accurate information that the two ancient stars, the Last Star and the First Star, actually existed.</p><br><p>Well, the new K4-Phantoms learned about this from their elders, just as it happened now between Adam and Wilfred.</p><br><p>What reasons did they have to believe the words of their elders?</p><br><p>It was very simple. There was evidence of the existence of the First Star and the Last Star. Oddly enough, it was not the Midnight Crystals and the Twilight Crystals.</p><br><p>In order to confirm that the crystals were part of the stars, it was necessary to take samples of each of them and compare them. In that case, it was necessary to see the First Star and the Last Star, touch them, and feel their power.</p><br><p>Soon, every creature living in this world would have that opportunity, and… no one was happy about it.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana sat in complete silence for a long time with their eyes wide open. They couldn’t believe what they heard, even though they understood that Wilfred was completely serious. He simply had no reason to lie to them in such a situation.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam and Silvana had their theories about why some monsters fell into the New Wave category and others into the Hollow Wave.</p><br><p>They were alarmed by the name itself, which indicated both age and consistency.</p><br><p>It could have been a simple coincidence due to the department’s decision to assign that particular definition, but… now everything was slowly falling into place.</p><br><p>“Wilfred, do you… Do you mean that? The Last Star really exists, and it’s going to destroy our world soon. What’s more… you said once again. What does that mean?”</p><br><p>Continuing to look away, Wilfred exhaled a cloud of smoke.</p><br><p>“It’s exactly as I said. This won’t be the first time the Last Star has descended upon our world. Every time it happens, the Last Star seeks to destroy the world, although… that’s not quite the right word.”</p><br><p>Then, he leaned forward while a stream of smoke passed in front of his deep green eyes.</p><br><p>“The world isn’t exactly destroyed, it’s more like it resets, keeping only a tiny part of itself. It’s a full world reset, something like that.”</p><br><p>Silvana gulped as she clutched the fabric of her pants.</p><br><p>“But… Mr. Wilfred, why is this happening? I mean, one day the Last Star will just appear in the sky, crash into the earth, and the world will end?”</p><br><p>“Well, despite how it sounds, you’re mostly right.”</p><br><br><p>Wilfred pulled out another cigarette as the green flame of his lighter lit the tip, igniting the ambers inside.</p><br><p>“You have to understand that this isn’t just because of the Last Star, but the First Star is involved as well.”</p><br><p>Adam frowned. “How? Are they both to blame for the fact that our world is about to end? A-Again…?”</p><br><p>“Hmm, that’s a complicated question. It’s too early to get into some things, but essentially, the First Star is the only reason the Last Star can’t fulfill its mission and destroy our world. As I said, despite the catastrophic consequences, it’s a reset, not destruction, because it’s already happened many times before.”</p><br><p>Wilfred tapped his ashtray before continuing.</p><br><p>“When it crashes into our world, the Last Star carries such incredible power that even the strongest Phantoms and Lords are unable to stop it, but the First Star can. Basically, to put it simply, this is what happens:</p><br><p>“The Last Star accumulates power to crash and destroy the world. At the same time, the First Star gathers enough energy and darkness to absorb most of the power of the Last Star when it collapses. It’s a vicious circle. Neither of the Stars can surpass or overpower the other.”</p><br><p>Adam touched his temple as his pupils trembled, trying to digest the information he just received.</p><br><p>After a moment, he raised his head and stared at Wilfred.</p><br><p>“I guess it’s useless to ask if the Citadel tried to stop the Last Star, right?”</p><br><p>Wilfred nodded weakly.</p><br><p>“Not only the Phantoms, but all the monsters have repeatedly tried to change something. As you can see, you are yet another young talent to whom I am telling this. So, no one has succeeded. The Last Star will fall, the First Star will try to stop it, and in the end, the whole world will be wiped out, leaving practically nothing behind.”</p><br><p>Silvana and Adam exchanged glances.</p><br><p>Despite the shocking revelation about the world, they still had many questions.</p><br><p>What they had figured out so far was that the Last Star was the problem. Its power was trying to destroy the world, while the First Star blocked part of the destructive wave so that the world would not disappear, but… only ruins remained.</p><br><p>“Damn it.” Adam shook his head. “I waited so long for this moment. I wanted to become a K4-Phantom not only for the power but also to uncover secrets. In the end… I find out that the world is about to be destroyed and there’s nothing we can do about it.”</p><br><p>Wilfred shrugged, blowing out a cloud of smoke.</p><br><p>“Yeah, it sucks, doesn’t it?”</p><br><p>Adam grimaced. “You don’t seem very concerned about this problem, do you?”</p><br><p>“Well, you’re on fire right now. You think that every problem has a solution, you just have to try hard enough, and everything will be fine. But, as I said earlier, you’re not the first person I’ve told about the World Wipe, Adam.”</p><br><p>Then, Adam took a deep breath and clasped his hands together.</p><br><p>“And when will it happen? When will the next World Wipe occur?”</p><br><p>Wilfred’s eyes darted to him, devoid of any emotion.</p><br><p>“Seven years. In seven years, the world will be reset again.”</p>
