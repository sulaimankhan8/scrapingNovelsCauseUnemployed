            <br><p>The S-Zone prisoners were very few, excluding Kayla and the newly arrived Adam and Edir, there were only five of them.</p><br><p>However, that day, the fight between Prago and Adam's squad was watched by many more people than five, and the reason was not because of Lola, who was a guide and not a prisoner.</p><br><p>Screens appeared all over the zones, even in the F-Zone and D-Zone, though originally they were not supposed to be there due to the prison conditions.</p><br><p>Each prisoner had the opportunity to watch three K1-Phantoms fighting against a K2-Phantom.</p><br><p>The fairly experienced Phantoms from B-Zone and A-Zone immediately realized that the fight would be interesting because when Adam's squad didn't lose in the aura clash, it meant that they could surprise, and they did!</p><br><br><p>Prago's painful scream spread throughout the S-Zone, blasting throughout Fall Hill Prison over the speakers as if breaking out of the screens to become a living nightmare for anyone who saw the gruesome scene.</p><br><p>"FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! Bastard! I'll rip you to pieces!" Prago roared like a wild beast, swinging his halberd in front of him and holding his face with his other hand.</p><br><p>Adam's attack succeeded, leaving on Prago's face five clear cuts that went through his skin, releasing streams of blood flowing rapidly downward.</p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily. In a way, the fact that he didn't have Nexus was an advantage to him, because he didn't have to save energy to use Nexus Traits.</p><br><p>However, that didn't mean he could use his silver claws constantly, specifically the active part of his Second Order - five released silver threads. </p><br><p>"Hahaha, right on target!" Edir exclaimed with excitement, disregarding the many tearing wounds on his body - received when he crashed into the destructive waves.</p><br><p>Kayla gulped, staring at Prago, it was actually even hard to look at and was scary to imagine the agony Prago was in.</p><br><p>If a regular K1-Phantom had been in Prago's place, Adam's silver threads would have gone through his head, cutting him into straight pieces.</p><br><p>Even if it had been someone at Edir's level, the threads would have gotten stuck in his head, unable to travel any further, but... apparently, that would have been enough to be fatal.</p><br><p>However... Adam was not satisfied with the result.</p><br><p>'Holy shit... How high is his defense?' Adam inwardly muttered, clenching his fists tightly while a single trickle of blood came out of the corner of his mouth.</p><br><p>'I attacked at such close range, but deep cuts are all I could get? However... It's unlikely he can survive another attack like that.' Adam got into a fighting stance, preparing for their opponent's next move.</p><br><p>The silver gauntlet disintegrated into many strands, while in his right hand appeared a needle in the first grip.</p><br><p>Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.</p><br><p>Adam spun his needle quickly, gradually swinging and accelerating, getting ready for a deadly throw.</p><br><p>Edir also decided to change his tactics and brought his hands back slightly with his palms open like spears. His blue flames concentrated on his fingertips instead of his entire hand, greatly increasing the damage but reducing the area.</p><br><p>The cold effect also underwent a change, a thin trail of ice covering his palms. Edir began to exhale a frosty vapor with each breath.</p><br><p>Of the three petals, two were already fully saturated with blood.</p><br><p>Adam and Edir had received their second enhancement, and they only had one more to go, after which Kayla's ability would reach its limit. Also, the golden hands continued to hover in the air, waiting for Kayla's command to attack.</p><br><p>They were on full alert, and their enemy was bleeding. Who would have thought that K2-Phantom would be in this position?</p><br><p>"Hah, didn't you say you were going to tear me apart? You don't seem to be in any hurry to attack at all." Adam smirked, "Well, in that case, I'll do it first!"</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam threw the needle forward - it split the air currents with a whistle as it approached Prago, but Adam wasn't aiming directly at him.</p><br><p>He threw the needle in such a way that it swirled around Prago, aiming the tip at his back, creating two threats at once: the needle and the sharp thread capable of cutting through even steel.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Prago stepped forward and opened his mouth wide with a fierce stare, only to clench his teeth sharply - severing the connecting thread.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, while his needle disintegrated into multiple threads, losing contact with him.</p><br><p>'He's opened up!' Edir appeared sharply behind Prago, about to take advantage of their enemy's vulnerable position.</p><br><p>"How I've had enough of you! It's useless against me!" Prago shouted, grabbing Edir by the neck at the last moment.</p><br><p>His fingertips stopped in front of Prago's eyes, unable to advance any further. There was no longer the fear and incomprehension in Prago's gaze that before - now only anger and a desire for revenge for the pain he had received.</p><br><p>"You'll be the first!" Prago roared, slamming Edir to the ground with all his might.</p><br><p>"Argh!" Edir cried out in pain, with clots of blood gushing out of his mouth.</p><br><p>The ground cracked under Prago's strength as he continued to squeeze Edir's neck, almost breaking it. Then, he didn't think that he had no right to kill prisoners, his anger for his face was too great.</p><br><br><p>Adam's fist plunged into Prago's stomach, knocking him unconscious for a moment, but he couldn't toss Prago away as he would have with a weaker opponent.</p><br><p>Then, Edir freed himself from Prago's grip and with both feet, attacked Prago's face with a sharp, spear-like thrust.</p><br><p>Without further ado, Adam and Edir continued their hail of blows, not intending to stop even for a moment. Kayla swung her hand, sending the golden hands on the attack. Their damage was low, but their numbers were considerable, and they constantly distracted Prago, who couldn't concentrate on Adam and Edir.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Edir continued to batter, covering Prago's entire body with bruises.</p><br><p>'Fine, it's time!' Adam internally exclaimed as he bounced back.</p><br><p>Edir's eyes went wide for a moment as he knew what that meant - they had discussed a similar scenario while making the plan.</p><br><p>That meant that Edir had to hold Prago alone for a few seconds. It was a difficult but possible task.</p><br><p>'Alright, it's my time to shine!' Edir exclaimed internally, pointing his palms towards each other and creating a blue sphere between them.</p><br><p>He didn't wait for it to reach full power and immediately detonated it, releasing a stream of cold fire onto Prago, and leaving a trail of dense ice on the ground.</p><br><p>"It won't work against me! Your fire is useless!" Prago exclaimed, holding out his halberd in front of him.</p><br><p>The dark blade of the halberd cut through the blue flame stream with ease.</p><br><p>"Hah, you idiot. Do you really think I'm naive enough to hope to freeze you with a weakened ability?" Edir smirked insidiously, for this was a distraction.</p><br><p>Unfortunately for Prago - he realized it too late.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Electric shocks traveled through Adam's fingertips, gathering in destructive power.</p><br><p>Prago's eyes went wide, with shivers all over his body, but he couldn't get away as dozens of golden hands flew sharply into him, holding him firmly in place!</p><br><p>"This is going to be a lot worse than those scratches on your face. I promise you." Adam said menacingly before clenching his fist, causing lightning discharges high above Prago.</p>
