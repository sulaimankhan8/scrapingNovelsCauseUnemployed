            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1515: Abyss Guards (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>The encounter with the golems was unexpected for Adam and Alexia, but so far, there was no indication that it would be as dangerous as the battle against the ice worm.</p><br><p>What really caught their attention was the Frost Oasis and the Head Golem’s words.</p><br><p>“Are you sure we’re ready?” Adam asked, confused.</p><br><p>He was ready for battle, but so far, he had mixed feelings about this encounter. He didn’t understand who the golems were: enemies? Allies? Or just observers?</p><br><p>“Yes… I will not ask why you wish to disturb the Frost Oasis… It is not important to me… However… I must be sure that your sacrifice will be worth it…”</p><br><p>Alexia raised an eyebrow, indignant.</p><br><p>“Sacrifice? Pfffft! What does that even mean? We’re not going to die!”</p><br><p>The Head Golem stared at her, then shifted his gaze to Adam. He could see that they were serious.</p><br><p>However, this did not change his opinion of them.</p><br><p>“Your courage is admirable… You will not be the first or the last to make this mistake… But isn’t that the essence of your nature, the nature of humans?”</p><br><p>The Head Golem raised his head, as if wanting to look toward the Citadel.</p><br><p>“You are willing to make the same mistake over and over again… in the futile hope of changing reality…”</p><br><p>Alexia wanted to argue with the Head Golem, she considered it an insult to them, but Adam beat her to it. He didn’t know why, but he liked this monster, it was as if he were talking to a robot that had only recently begun to understand how this unfair world worked.</p><br><p>“Why?” Adam asked with a slight smile on his face. “Isn’t that the main strength of humans? We can adapt to any situation.”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the Head Golem shook his head.</p><br><p>“Young man, you are mistaken… But I don’t blame you. You have lived in this world too little to understand that these lands are the only ones that have truly adapted to the rules of this world…”</p><br><p>The Head Golem waved his heavy hand through the air:</p><br><p>“All the rest, the darkness on one side and chaos on the other… as well as the combination of the two sides in the very center… You are all just trying to change the current rules, not adapt to them…”</p><br><p>Alexia frowned as she struggled to keep herself from yelling at the Head Golem.</p><br><p>‘What is this piece of rock talking about?!’ She exclaimed internally.</p><br><p>However, Adam understood the Head Golem.</p><br><p>‘I see. He’s talking about the Dark Shore, Tarnished Lands, and… the Citadel?’</p><br><p>Adam took a deep breath.</p><br><p>“So, you’re willing to let us pass at the Frost Oasis only if we prove ourselves worthy, and you’re convinced that this will be the end for us. Have I understood correctly?”</p><br><p>The Head Golem nodded.</p><br><p>“Yes… young Phantom. I sense a thirst for battle in your heart… You came here to become stronger… But, regardless of the outcome, I will not stop you. If you are worthy, then you have the right to proceed.”</p><br><p>In response, Adam pointed behind him at the corpse of the ice worm.</p><br><p>“See? We took care of that big guy and suffered no significant injuries. I think that pretty much shows how strong we are.”</p><br><p>Adam expected the Head Golem to step aside or confirm his words, but instead…</p><br><p>“Haha… Hahaha!” The Head Golem laughed while the other golems behind him shook their heads.</p><br><p>It was obvious that Adam didn’t understand something, some principle.</p><br><p>“You decided that I should test your strength? If it were that simple, I wouldn’t have had to stop you… Even though your auras are calm and hidden… That’s enough for me to understand your power level…”</p><br><p>“Arh?” Alexia grimaced. “Then why the hell did you stop us? That worm was strong, we killed it so that we can move on!”</p><br><p>Without waiting for the Head Golem’s response, who was doing everything slowly and unhurriedly, Alexia stepped forward. She wasn’t afraid that the Head Golem or his subordinates would attack her, even if it happened, she was ready for it.</p><br><p>“Pffft! I’m not going to waste any more time, I’m just going to go there and—!”</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Alexia crashed into something with such force that she fell to the ground and grabbed her reddened forehead.</p><br><p>“Ouch!” Alexia exclaimed before opening her eyes.</p><br><p>The wave ran along an invisible barrier that surrounded the abyss. The golems were outside its limits.</p><br><p>“What? Where did this barrier come from?!”</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>“It’s always been here.”</p><br><br><p>Adam looked at the Head Golem.</p><br><br><p>The Head Golem nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“You couldn’t see it before… That’s what I was talking about… Until you overcome this barrier, you won’t be able to reach the Frost Oasis.”</p><br><p>“What? You should have said so right away!” Alexia exclaimed and stood up.</p><br><p>Without warning, she clenched her fist and slammed it into the barrier with all her might. She was sure that the force of her blow would be enough to create a breach.</p><br><br><br><p>The impact threw Alexia to the side. With a whoosh of wind, she flew past Adam, who just looked at her with curiosity.</p><br><p>It was obvious that they would not be able to destroy the barrier by force.</p><br><p>“So, if this barrier cannot be broken by attack, how are we supposed to get through it?”</p><br><p>The Head Golem tilted his head forward, looking into Adam’s eyes.</p><br><p>“You already know the answer, don’t you, young man?”</p><br><br><p>“The ancient energy?”</p><br><p>The Head Golem waved his hand, pointing to the barrier, part of which was now visible. It was pale blue, with a faint purple hue around the edges.</p><br><p>“I won’t hide it… If you were much stronger, you could destroy this barrier by pure power alone… However, in your case, you must use the ancient energy, or rather, accept it…”</p><br><br><p>“And? How do we do that?”</p><br><p>The Head Golem waved his hand.</p><br><p>“You can try, or you… young man… can accept my blow and feel the ancient energy for yourself…”</p>
