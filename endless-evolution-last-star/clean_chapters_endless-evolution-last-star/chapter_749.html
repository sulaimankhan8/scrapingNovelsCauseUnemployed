            <br><p>It didn’t matter if it was the Citadel, the Pacific Lands, or the Wild Lands, battles happened everywhere. It wasn’t always physical, it wasn’t always deadly, and there wasn’t always a winner.
</p><br><p>But, if there was one, it was always the strongest, whether it was simple physical strength, intelligence, amount of money, or energy. Everything that could lead to victory was considered and influenced the further outcome of all beings involved in the battle.
</p><br><p>Did the Blind Commander understand this?
</p><br><p>Sure, but he was pushing this moment as far away as possible. He infamously lost to the first Phantom to enter the fortress, and to some extent that was the end of his mission, since Adam could move on straight to the External Artifact.
</p><br><p>He was badly wounded, but it wasn’t a big problem for him. If he wanted to, he would have joined the battle defending the fortress long ago, but there was no need for him to do so, until now.
</p><br><p>The Blind Commander knew what the monsters inside the fortress, especially the archers, were capable of, how durable the walls were, and that during the Eclipse, the Phantoms would side with them.
</p><br><p>But, the Dormant Lord, his appearance changed everything. Neither the walls nor the archers could stop him, the Blind Commander understood this well, he didn’t act because he had hope in the Phantoms, in Katrin as the strongest of them, but he quickly realized that she wouldn’t last long.
</p><br><p>Naturally, the monsters shouldn’t have cared whether the Phantoms won or lost, but in this case, they were on the same side.
</p><br><p>The Blind Commanders, as a species of monsters, were careless and lazy. For this reason, they often dwelled in abandoned Nests or massive Strongholds, places where they could constantly get energy and do nothing most of the time.
</p><br><p>This was a great option for them, and this particular Blind Commander was no different from his fellows.
</p><br><p>However, they were also not cowards and always honored their commitments, especially to External Artifact, although... in their case a lot depended on personal gain.
</p><br><p>The Blind Commander decided to fight because he realized that if the Dormant Lord won, he and the waves of monsters would destroy the fortress. Continue your saga on NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>True, nothing bad would have happened to the Blind Commander, in a worst-case scenario he would simply escape from the fortress and continue his journey.
</p><br><p>But... who wanted to lose their home?
</p><br><p>Neither monsters nor humans would stand by and watch as an enemy force destroyed the place where they set roots - if they could protect it, if they had the strength to do so, then they would surely do their best.
</p><br><br><p>The Blind Commander slowly approached the hilt of his sword, the only part of his weapon that was not the key to one of the three statues. This part made him different from the other two Commanders, who, unlike him, fell long ago, plunged forever into darkness.
</p><br><p>Bright blue flames continued to shoot from the top of the spire, unabated. At the Fortress of the Lone Serpent, there were many sources of purple flame, red and amber flames, but the blue one was only one and gave off no heat at all, as did the Blind Commander.
</p><br><p>Clash. Clash. Clash.
</p><br><p>At the same time, in front of the northern wall, the two flashes continued to clash fiercely, but if a few minutes ago they had been on an equal footing, now the white flash was quickly taking the lead.
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord was getting faster and stronger, his physical and energy reserves were still near their peak, but the same could not be said for Katrin.
</p><br><p>She tried to do her best, to use all her experience and knowledge of her enemy. Her abilities were as strong as she was, even among her level she was an outstanding Phantom, but it wasn’t enough.
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord wasn’t just better than many, he was one of the few best. Unfortunately, Katrin could not claim the same position despite her wild desire to reach the top.
</p><br><br><p>Shaking his head, with an annoyed grunt, the Blind Commander raised the hilt of his sword. Then, casting a disgruntled glance at Katrin, he headed towards the blue flames.
</p><br><p>Without fear of burning or turning into a block of ice, the Blind Commander sat down directly in front of the stream of flame, his legs crossed as he watched his intermittent reflection in the clear blaze.
</p><br><p>The tight bandages didn’t seem to prevent him from savoring this view - one last time. And, he would miss not the flames, but his appearance.
</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, the Blind Commander pointed his hand directly into the fire, holding the hilt of his sword tightly.
</p><br><p>A thin layer of ice quickly began to cover his skin, the flames taking just a few seconds to permanently turn the monster’s hand into part of an ice statue.
</p><br><p>Yet, the Blind Commander was not going to lose his arm or die, it was too early for that.
</p><br><p>With the hilt pointing downward, the Blind Commander brought his hand down sharply, straight to the gape where powerful flames were bursting out from the depths running along the tall spire.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Fortress of the Lone Serpent lost its brightest source of light. The blue flames that lit up the vast expanse of land vanished, the spire simply faded away, and only one creature knew why.
</p><br><p>With a slight wheeze, the Blind Commander gripped the hilt tighter, the cracks in the ground were saturated with bright light, the flames were about to erupt.
</p><br><p>If the fire didn’t find a way out, it would destroy any obstacle in its path, which meant the Blind Commander was first on the list.
</p><br><p>However, this was what he was seeking, this was what he had to do a long time ago, but he didn’t need all this headache. If he had the chance he would stay here for the rest of his life, enjoying the gorgeous view from the top of the spire every day.
</p><br><p>Yet, life was always changing, and those who couldn’t keep up with the pace were out of the race for survival.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Then, as the flames reached their maximum strength about to lash out at the Blind Commander, an active shudder went through the entire fortress, attracting even more attention than Katrin’s fight against the Dormant Lord.</p>
