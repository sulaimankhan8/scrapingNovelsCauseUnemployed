            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1210: Blaze Ring (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>The abilities of Operators depended on their Phantoms, and they also tried to compensate for their partners’ weaknesses.</p><br><p>In this regard, Fromund and Adam were quite similar. They both preferred to rush into battle and use their abilities to overwhelm the enemy. Sure, their strengths were very different, but they weren’t the type to rely on defense or stealth like some Phantoms.</p><br><p>Thus, Silvana had the ability to heal Adam, which didn’t make him immortal, but was a great help considering the circumstances.</p><br><p>Arayna, on the other hand, had no healing abilities, but she had another way to help Fromund, who always fought against large groups of enemies, as that was his specialty.</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Fromund opened his eyes and looked at the dark debris around him.</p><br><p>Just before Marhen’s white needle was about to reach Fromund and blow him to pieces, a protective dome made of dense material saturated with Arayna’s energy appeared around him.</p><br><p>Each stone was fused with another by their combined flames, turning the barrier into a solid structure for maximum protection.</p><br><p>However, even this could not completely protect Fromund. Almost nothing remained of Arayna’s barrier, and there was an obvious wound on his shoulder. However, if it weren’t for Arayna, Fromund’s situation would have been much worse.</p><br><p>“This monster… He turned out to be much stronger than I expected,” Arayna muttered.</p><br><p>Fromund nodded, stepping forward, pebbles rolling at his feet.</p><br><p>“Yes… His aura isn’t as intimidating as Bathild’s, but something’s not right about him. He’s too good, I don’t even know how to describe it. His mastery is great.”</p><br><p>With a deep nod, Arayna agreed with him.</p><br><p>“I noticed that, too. What’s more, I’ve been watching Adam’s fight as well, and… Bathild doesn’t look as strong as I expected. Her energy and aura are enormous, and her lightning bolts are terrifying, but I don’t see why Adam should lose and why the other monsters should follow her.”</p><br><p>It was unclear where these thoughts would lead them, but they didn’t have time to think about it.</p><br><p>The thunder monsters gradually approached, bypassing Fromund.</p><br><p>Before the explosion, there had been several meters of solid rock and caves between them, but now there was only a crater and floating dust, nothing else.</p><br><p>One of the monsters grinned.</p><br><p>“Hah, he turned out to be much stronger than I thought!”</p><br><p>“Yeah, but what else could we expect from Adam Vinter’s partner?”</p><br><p>“Enough talk! As long as he’s alive, we can’t relax!”</p><br><p>Some of the monsters decided that victory was close. Marhen’s attack hadn’t killed Fromund, but they believed that Fromund simply had no way to fight back and would gradually break down under the pressure.</p><br><p>Others, more experienced, remained patient, waiting for their enemy’s next move or orders from Marhen.</p><br><p>From time to time, tremors could be felt from above, reminding the monsters that another important battle was taking place on the surface, between their leader and the famous young Phantom.</p><br><br><p>Fromund plunged his spear into the ground as it disappeared in a shower of sparks.</p><br><p>Then, he spread his arms wide, looking at the monsters as if they were his guests in a throne room.</p><br><p>“Well, well, do you really want to defeat me so badly? I’m afraid you haven’t seen what I’m capable of yet!”</p><br><p>Fromund and Arayna had one trump card, as did every K4-Phantom, but he wasn’t going to use it, not now.</p><br><p>He had other methods for battle.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>His aura grew more powerful as flames ran through his frame, turning into long pieces of red-hot fabric hanging from his shoulders and sleeves and loosely covering his body.</p><br><p>Then, behind Fromund, a wide, spinning ring of dense blaze appeared, casting light on the dark caves around them.</p><br><p>And deep in his eyes, around his pupils, amber rings appeared, full of excitement and anticipation of battle.</p><br><p>The monsters looked at each other, puzzled. They knew well about Adam’s abilities, but Fromund was an unknown Phantom to them. All they could do was watch or take a risk and find out what he was capable of now.</p><br><br><p>Fromund stepped forward, leaving a bright trail on the ground from his now bare feet. Along with the flames, his clothes and boots disappeared, replaced by a cloth outfit.</p><br><p>“Come on, which one of you will be the first? I know there are many impatient ones among you. I don’t judge you, because I am the same!”</p><br><p>Before Marhen could give the command, two monsters rushed forward. They were the same monsters that had attacked Fromund at the very beginning.</p><br><p>They were going to attack him and overwhelm him using the same attacks, but this time, Fromund was ready.</p><br><p>He didn’t need a weapon to fight them, as his body was a weapon.</p><br><br><p>At that moment, the outline of a hammer appeared in the blaze ring behind him.</p><br><p>Marhen’s eyes widened as he threw his arm forward.</p><br><p>“Fuck! You two idiots, stop!”</p><br><p>However, his shout didn’t reach them, and they had no intention of stopping as they were already right in front of Fromund.</p><br><p>“Hahaha, you’re finished! We’ll quickly deal with you and watch Bathild tear your friend to pieces!”</p><br><p>“Yes! That’ll be quite a sight!” the second monster agreed as his lightning-filled claws were about to touch Fromund’s shoulder.</p><br><p>With a fleeting grin, Fromund stepped forward.</p><br><br><p>One step was enough to shake the surface.</p><br><p>Then, he clenched his right fist tightly and slammed it with all his might into the second monster. Fromund didn’t aim for the head or any weak spot, no, his fist moved straight for the monster’s chest to hit its target.</p><br><p>And that’s exactly what happened.</p><br><br><p>Flaming lines ran across the monster’s body as incredible physical power crashed into it like a steel hammer, blowing the monster to pieces.</p><br><p>Drops of blood fell on Fromund’s face as his heart began to beat faster. He finally felt like he was in the middle of a worthy battle, even though he had to start with weaklings.</p><br><p>The second monster instinctively jumped aside, but Fromund’s knee was already moving toward him, ready to do the same thing it had done to his partner.</p>
