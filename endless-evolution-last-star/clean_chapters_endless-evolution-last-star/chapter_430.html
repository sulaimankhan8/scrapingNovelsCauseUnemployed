            <br><p>Slice. Slice. Slice.</p><br><p>The Vinter Family gathered around a table, the main course of which was a large lasagna with a huge amount of cheese, meat, and sauce.</p><br><p>Even six people could hardly eat it all at once, but... there was one Phantom among them, who unlike ordinary people could consume much more calories than the others.</p><br><p>Leona cut the lasagna into several pieces, putting a piece for each of them. However, the pieces were not the same, only hers and Gary's. The smallest piece was reserved for Trici.</p><br><p>Sure, she demanded that she get as large a portion as possible, but Leona realized that it would be a miracle if Trici ate that much. After all, the satiety of a particular food was not determined by size, but by the amount of calories, and the type of calories.</p><br><p>Eating two bars of chocolate with a total of one thousand calories was very easy, it had a lot of carbohydrates and sugar, which did not satiate very much and was loved by the human brain because it was a quick source of energy.</p><br><p>But, eating a thousand calories in foods like cheese or meat, which are low in carbs and high in protein, was a different story and a much more difficult task.</p><br><p>It could be compared to soda and milk. Drinking a liter of soda was easy and quick, moreover, it didn't even quench thirst, but drinking a liter of milk was a great challenge even though they had the same amount of calories.</p><br><p>"Mom! This piece is too small!"</p><br><p>Trici exclaimed puffing up her cheeks and crossing her arms over her chest unhappily.</p><br><p>"I haven't eaten all day! I can eat a piece twice as big! That's for sure!"</p><br><p>Leona smiled bitterly, shaking her head.</p><br><p>"I already told you, if you eat this then I'll give you another piece. I'm not greedy, but you'll have a hard time eating this one."</p><br><p>Trici cast a glare at Leona before looking at Adam. Unlike Trici, to him, Leona put the biggest piece since she knew that Phantoms had a much higher appetite than ordinary humans.</p><br><p>"Pffft! It's not fair for him to have such a big piece!" Trici snorted. It was the typical whims of any child and little sister.</p><br><p>"Hmm. Maybe you should do a test then? I'm sure Adam will eat his big piece faster than you eat your little one." Leona said confidently putting her hands at her sides and looking at Trici with a smirk on her face.</p><br><p>But... before Trici could give her answer, Adam spoke up: "No."</p><br><p>Trici and Leona looked at him, clearly expecting a different answer.</p><br><p>Adam picked up his knife and fork, beginning to carefully and slowly cut his piece into smaller ones.</p><br><p>"I don't want to rush into anything. I've been waiting to eat lasagna like this all my poor life. I want to savor this moment."</p><br><p>Adam said calmly, bringing the fork up to his mouth.</p><br><p>"However, if you want you can have a competition with each other. I won't get in your way."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged before finally getting a taste of the dish he wanted so badly and waited so long for.</p><br><p>Waves of pleasure spread throughout his body while the red sauce gushed into his mouth like divine juice.</p><br><br><br><p>Red drops flew in front of Glara's face, a torrent of blood rushing from Redcore Wolf's left paw.</p><br><p>A flash of pain reflected on the monster's face as his eyes went wide in disbelief, unwilling to accept reality.</p><br><br><p>The plasma charge ripped a chunk of flesh from Redcore Wolf's paw as well as a single claw that flew off to the side and crashed into the wall, leaving a red stain.</p><br><p>A few drops of blood landed on Glara's pale face, running down her cheeks in crimson trickles.</p><br><br><p>Immediately, following her instincts and her body's desires, Glara thrust her right leg forward, closing the distance between her and the Redcore Wolf.</p><br><p>Her shotgun only had eight charges, just how many shots it had enough energy for.</p><br><p>'Seven more shots left...'</p><br><p>Glara internally muttered seeing only Redcore Wolf in front of her, it seemed that the rest of the world no longer mattered.</p><br><br><br><p>Glara aimed her shotgun at Redcore Wolf's head before pulling the trigger.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The plasma shotgun shuddered, purple energy lines running down its black body, gathering all the power within.</p><br><p>Then, a second later, a powerful plasma charge flew out of the double-barreled muzzle, ending up in front of Redcore Wolf's shocked eyes.</p><br><p>It was unknown if Redcore Wolf could withstand a direct blast of the plasma projectile to the head, but like Glara, he had instincts that couldn't allow him to stand still.</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, Redcore Wolf jerked his head, partially dodging the shot.</p><br><br><p>Before Redcore Wolf could recover, Glara took another step forward, removing her block.</p><br><p>The monster's right paw immediately collapsed downward from the previous inertia, but since Glara had taken several steps forward, the red claws crashed not into Glara, but into the steel floor behind her.</p><br><br><p>Glara swung her shield twice as a plasma disk, its sharp blades spinning at tremendous speed.</p><br><p>Bursts of blood rushed from Redcore Wolf's chest, where it left an x-shape deep cut with charred flesh due to the high temperature.</p><br><p>'That shield. I didn't know it had another function. Good thing I was told about it.'</p><br><p>Glara pondered as she took the last step and crashed the shield into Redcore Wolf's chest with its broadest part as if she was trying to push the large creature away.</p><br><p>Sure, even with Code D, the human body didn't have enough strength to do that, Redcore Wolf's entire body was several hundred kilograms and his body was strong and stable.</p><br><p>But, technology could bring its adjustments in a deadly battle between a human and a monster.</p><br><p>After all, Glara was now utilizing the successes of two free scientists at once.</p><br><br><p>The shield shuddered before red pulses traveled across its surface. Then, they came out in a single point, crashing down on Redcore Wolf's chest like an energy wave, throwing the monster to the other side of the room with great force.</p><br><br><p>Glara exhaled hot steam as her gaze darkened.</p><br><p>'This is bad... There's only three minutes left...'</p>
