            <br><p>Click. Click. Click.</p><br><p>Silvana clicked the remote control with a bored look, flipping through the TV channels. She rarely watched TV, but this evening she had nothing to do. Adam hadn't given her any assignments, so far he wasn't going to be involved in missions and there were no sudden problems.</p><br><p>Sure, this wasn't the first time Silvana had free time, after all, everyone should have a rest. But, usually in her free time she was researching or learning something, in general, she tried to make the most of it.</p><br><p>However, today she had the urge to spend her time on some nonsense, as if someone who had always eaten properly had the urge to eat something unhealthy but tasty.</p><br><p>"Hmm... I wonder what Adam is doing now?" Silvana muttered as she continued to click the remote control and change channels, so far nothing had managed to catch her attention.</p><br><p>After a while, Silvana shook her head.</p><br><p>"Damn, I have to stop thinking about him all the time. We just recently finished a difficult, long mission, so this is the best moment to use the time for my pleasure, isn't it?"</p><br><br><p>Pondering and muttering to herself, Silvana suddenly reached some of the last channels, and... this was something children weren't supposed to see until they reached a certain age.</p><br><p>Perhaps someone in Silvana's place would have been embarrassed or baffled and rushed to turn off the TV, but she only smiled slyly as she watched the curious scene unfold before her eyes.</p><br><p>"Well, a free, lonely evening, couldn't think of a better time for a young lady, could it?" Silvana smirked, setting the remote aside, not intending to touch it for a long time yet.</p><br><br><p>Maybe in a different way, but Adam was also immersed in pleasure, making sure that not only he was enjoying himself, but also the one who was no longer his girlfriend today.</p><br><p>Well, his relationship with Jena wasn't initially burdened with any rules and prohibitions, it was Jena's whim that Adam had agreed to so he could feel a new experience and try the unknown.</p><br><p>It allowed them to avoid arguments and negativity, instead enjoying each other. They lived in different worlds, but they were both stressed out at work. Adam was a Phantom and Jena was a medic...</p><br><p>Sometimes, she had to face absolutely desperate situations. Adam could still make a difference on the battlefield, but when a wounded person couldn't be saved, Jena could only watch the imminent death.</p><br><p>She realized that it was normal since she was a medic and was prepared for it, but that didn't mean she didn't care and it didn't affect her in any way.</p><br><br><p>Every day there were thousands of encounters in the world, this day there was one that involved three people, and... while two were enjoying themselves in similar ways but in different methods, the third one was ready to wake up to plunge into the depths of animal fear.</p><br><p>"Agh... Where am I? What's going on...?" Glara muttered clutching her head.</p><br><p>She didn't know how much time had passed or where she was, but her head ached slightly, everything in front of her eyes was blurry.</p><br><p>It was only after a few minutes that her vision cleared, allowing her to see a large room with white walls and bright lights.</p><br><p>She was lying on a wide, white bed wearing the same clothes.</p><br><p>Panic quickly began to bubble up inside her, her heart beating faster and adrenaline ready to rush through her entire body.</p><br><p>Glara knew nothing about Morton Observatory or the purpose of her kidnappers, but she knew that this could not end well for her.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, before Glara could even reach the point of despair and truly terrifying thoughts, the doors opened, revealing three silhouettes, one was tall and the other two were considerably shorter.</p><br><p>With a sharp jerk of her head, Glara saw Gladius, who stood calmly in the center of the doorway, his hands were placed behind his back and there was a slight smirk on his face.</p><br><p>Beside him were two girls in black robes, not too tight and not too puffy, something between nurse and maid outfits.</p><br><p>"Welcome to Morton Observatory, to a place where there are no miracles, no technology, and no morality, but there is hope for a bright future, though not for everyone." Gladius said poetically with a slightly raised hand in the air.</p><br><p>At the same time, the two girls stepped forward simultaneously, approaching Glara.</p><br><p>"No. Go away! Don't touch me!" Glara exclaimed, crawling back to the far side of the bed until she reached the headboard.</p><br><p>However, the girls weren't going to stop.</p><br><p>"Glara, calm down, there's no point in fighting. These two are ex-military, so they can easily immobilize you if necessary."</p><br><p>Gladius said softly addressing Glara, then his gaze went to the assistants and his voice guarded more sternly.</p><br><p>"Don't you dare harm her. She is potentially part of an important experiment. I think you know what happens in the case of failure." Gladius uttered as an eerie aura began to emanate from him.</p><br><p>The girls gulped and nodded simultaneously, a shiver ran through their bodies.</p><br><p>Then, one of them reached forward, showing Glara a kind smile on her face.</p><br><p>"Mrs. Glara, please follow us, I don't want to use force."</p><br><p>However... feigned kindness could only be useful when the target wasn't scared to death, such a trick couldn't work on Glara anymore.</p><br><p>Glara turned around and saw a white vase on the nightstand next to the bed, without hesitation, she smashed the vase with her fist, grasping the sharp splinter tightly, holding it in front of her like a knife.</p><br><p>Streams of scarlet blood flowed down her delicate arms, pain spreading through her body, but it was only a resource her mind used to protect itself.</p><br><p>Gladius raised an eyebrow, it seemed he had not expected Glara to act so determined. A satisfied smirk showed up on his face.</p><br><p>"Not bad, not bad at all, strong women are always attractive."</p><br><p>The other girl snorted, blowing away a lock of hair that hung annoyingly in front of her face.</p><br><p>"Well, you decided to complicate things, so now don't blame us for what happened."</p><br><p>Before Glara could do anything, the sharp splinter disappeared from her hand, finding itself clutched between the girl's fingers. Instinctively, Glara lunged forward to retrieve her weapon.</p><br><p>The second girl smirked, pulled a rope out of her pocket, and got behind Glara. At this time, the first girl pressed down on Glara's back, pinning her to the bed.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Glara's hands were firmly bound, not allowing her to move freely.</p><br><p>The assistants made everything quick, efficient, and as painless as possible.</p><br><p>"Come on, we've already been threatened by Gladius because of you, but if we piss off the man in charge, that's when it gets really scary." The second girl uttered before picking up Glara and throwing her onto her shoulder.</p><br><p>Even though they were about the same height, the second girl's strength far surpassed Glara's, to her Glara was as light as a feather.</p><br><p>"What...? What's going to happen next...?" Glara muttered in a trembling voice as the second girl walked past Gladius.</p><br><p>Gladius smirked, a dangerous gleam running through his eyes.</p><br><p>"Do you want the sweet lie or the bitter truth?"</p><br><br><p>"The truth... tell it like it is."</p><br><p>Gladius spread his hands apart, shaking his head.</p><br><p>"Well, there are three options. One, we fail and we bring you home. Two, you die, and... Third, the most interesting one, you become a Phantom!"</p>
