            <br><p>After about ten minutes, the ice had melted considerably, and all the members of the Scarlet River Squad were free.</p><br><p>The Phantoms were able to break their crystals when their upper body became unbound, and then they helped the Harvesters, for they couldn't do so. Without the help of the Phantoms, the Harvesters would have had to wait for the ice to completely melt.</p><br><p>"Mirage..." Dargo muttered with a deep gaze, "We had no information about it... Damn, the chances were so slim, but it still happened."</p><br><br><p>"Only Adam and I were able to get through the trial, luckily we were able to destroy the Mirage, though it took some sacrifices for us to do so..." Zera replied. She was calm, but deep inside, she regretted that they didn't know about the Mirage because things could have been different.</p><br><p>If more Phantoms, or at least Dargo and Hazel had come through, the four of them would have easily defeated all the anomalous monsters, and even the Steel Knight wouldn't have been an obstacle in their way.</p><br><p>"How many casualties do we have...?" Hazel asked, biting her lip, "If we saved even half of the squad, it would already be a miracle considering the circumstances."</p><br><p>Zera smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"Well... In this case, I have good news for you, if it can even be called that. Thanks to Adam, the fact that he defeated Crown Type one, we've only lost 25% of the Harvesters and 10% of the Phantoms."</p><br><p>Hazel nodded deeply.</p><br><br><p>Then, she looked intently at Adam and, to his surprise, bowed low.</p><br><p>"Thank you. I may sound cynical, but 25% and 10% is infinitely better than losing 100%! I thank you not only for saving the lives of the members of the Scarlet River Squad but also for the fact that I can now speak and breathe. I failed the Mirage trial, and if I had died, it would have been my fault alone."</p><br><p>Dargo glanced at Hazel, nodded slightly, and did the same. He wasn't as wordy as Hazel, but his posture said it all and without words.</p><br><p>Adam was embarrassed as he scratched the back of his head. He turned to Zera, trying to start a conversation with her somehow to dispel this awkward situation, however... Zera bowed low too, without raising her head.</p><br><p>Then, Adam turned around, looking at the Phantoms and Harvesters, they, one by one, began to do the same.</p><br><p>Recognition and respect were the least they could give Adam for saving their lives.</p><br><p>Sure, some of them had lost friends or even family today, but they were alive, and that was the best thing that could have happened to them in Dead Lands.</p><br><p>Adam didn't bother to say anything, he accepted their intentions with a serious look and nodded, not wanting to reject their sincere feelings.</p><br><p>After a while Zera looked up, Hazel and Dargo followed, soon everyone else returned to normal.</p><br><p>"Khm. I think it's about time to get to the fun part, don't you?" Zera coughed, then her gaze traveled upward.</p><br><p>Where Mirage had started, where the center of the anomaly cluster had been, there was now a huge sphere of misty blue energy that slowly rotated as if a hurricane was inside.</p><br><p>On the ground, there was a stone disk, a third of the cells of which shone brightly, but there was nowhere else to get energy because the crystals as well as the Mirage had been destroyed.</p><br><p>"Go ahead. You have to do it." Zera pointing to the disk, "Break it and get the Mirage treasure!"</p><br><p>Adam nodded, clenched his fist tightly, and brought it down on the disk.</p><br><p>He had almost no strength left after the fight with the Steel Knight, but he could still land one punch.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The disk cracked, and it shattered, releasing all of its energy.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the misty sphere shuddered and in a moment opened up, revealing several artifacts hovering above the ground.</p><br><p>At the center of the First Rarity Artifacts was a single Second Rarity Level - in the form of a crystal azure eye with a vertical pupil. </p><br><p>Considering that on their way to the center, the Scarlet River Squad found about ten Zero Rarity Artifacts and zero First Rarity ones, this bounty was enough to cover all the loot from the entire anomaly cluster!</p><br><p>Naturally, the main treasure was the Second Rarity Artifact. While the First Rarity was 10 times rarer than Zero ones, the Second one was 100 times rarer!</p><br><p>However, these were not the correct numbers, because not every anomaly could contain a First or Second Rarity Artifact. The anomaly had to be either large enough or in a dangerous region. Well... sometimes could really get very lucky indeed, but it was rare.</p><br><p>"Adam... You want to take it...?" Zera muttered, looking at the Second Rarity Artifact.</p><br><p>"No." Adam replied sharply.</p><br><p>Adam didn't know what this artifact was capable of and wasn't willing to risk it. His artifact, False Orb, already had Three Traits unlocked, it wasn't the limit. He could further develop his artifact and go beyond Traits.</p><br><p>Zera nodded. She had seen the fight from afar and realized that it didn't make sense for Adam to change his artifact. He had to improve his artifact, which was his weapon and part of the power he was used to using.</p><br><p>Phantoms sometimes changed their artifacts, but many preferred not to because it was like losing a weapon you had been using for a long time, only to replace it with something new, not sure if the new one would be better than the old one.</p><br><p>After all, the experience was a priceless resource, because to earn it you had to spend another priceless resource - time.</p><br><p>"In that case, you should take the First Rarity Level Artifacts, it would be a worthy exchange." Zera suggested.</p><br><p>"Sure. I was going to do exactly that. This was my first Mirage, and hopefully, I won't have to face something like this soon." Adam muttered with a deep gaze.</p><br><p>He had received many rewards, ranging from combat experience to artifacts with Power Gene. However, this was no easy ride, but a dangerous mission, for no one was safe from the death that was always around in Dead Lands.</p><br><br><p>Zera clapped her hands together, drawing attention to herself.</p><br><p>"Alright! Help will be arriving soon, but until then, we have to get all the artifacts and monster parts for the missions department! Let's go! We don't have much time! It's time for you to get to work!"</p><br><br><p>The members of the Scarlet River Squad simultaneously replied, spreading out across the anomaly cluster area. The artifacts, whether Zero or First Rarity Level, were waiting for someone to collect them, and the Scarlet River Squad had enough containers for that.</p><br><p>In the meantime, Adam stepped aside, sat down on a cold iron block, and closed his eyes with a deep sigh.</p><br><p>He had seen it for a moment during the battle, but at that time, all his attention was focused on the Steel Knight instead of the artifact.</p><br><br><p>First Trait - Lightning Reflexes</p><br><p>Second Trait - Lightning Step</p><br><p>Third Trait - Thunder Punishment]</p><br><p>[The maximum number of Traits has been reached!</p><br><p>You must evolve the artifact to Second Rarity Level in order to gain further Traits!]</p><br><br><p>1 - 10 Purple Threat Level genes</p><br><p>2 - 10 of any Zero Rarity Artifacts</p><br><p>3 - 1 Essence of a suitable element!]</p>
