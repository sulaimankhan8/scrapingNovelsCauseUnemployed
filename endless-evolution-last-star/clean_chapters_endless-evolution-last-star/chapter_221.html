            <br><br><p>Prago ran forward, stepping on the blood-covered salt ground. He was probably the only one here who could walk straight towards the three strongest monsters without fear of being killed instantly.</p><br><p>'What's next? Take on Obsidian Armadillo and Jade Lady? Yeah, in your condition you'll be able to hold them off for a while, but no more than that. You can't stand up to two of them at once.' Adelia said with a serious voice.</p><br><br><p>"Don't worry about it. Like I said earlier, I'm not going to fight Jade Lady. I have a better candidate for that. However... I need to act quickly." Prago's look became serious as he appeared next to Obsidian Armadillo.</p><br><p>No one had noticed him yet, but thanks to his instincts, Obsidian Armadillo had managed to curl up, taking on a protective form that seemed impossible to penetrate. But, Prago wasn't going to do that, at least not now.</p><br><br><p>A water disk appeared in front of Prago's palm as he attacked the monster. Sure, such a simple attack that was Prago's First Order couldn't hurt Obsidian Armadillo, his dark crystals just absorbed all the damage, but... the force of inertia from the momentum didn't go anywhere.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Obsidian Armadillo shuddered violently as the impact threw the dark disk aside, several meters away.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>Just now, one of them had been attacked, but Obsidian Armadillo was not his ally. In this case, it didn't matter whether Phantom or Monster, Thunder Demon just wanted worthy opponents, and Prago could be one.</p><br><p>"Rgha... Rgha... Rgha..." Thunder Demon threateningly wheezed, as he was about to step forward to greet Prago.</p><br><p>However... Prago wasn't going to stay here for too long, after all, he didn't come here to fight.</p><br><p>Prago extended his hand towards Jade Lady, as a water vortex appeared around his wrist.</p><br><p>Jade Lady was wary, she narrowed her eyes at Prago and prepared to deflect the attack.</p><br><p>Prago smirked as several powerful tentacles emerged from the water stream. Before the Jade Lady could realize anything, the tentacles were around her from all sides, preventing her from even opening her wings.</p><br><p>Anyway, Prago was a K2-Phantom, and this was his Second Order. Even the strongest Purple Threat Level monsters couldn't easily resist his attacks.</p><br><br><p>Multiple Ladies, simultaneously attacked the tentacles, trying to free their leader from captivity, but... their swords couldn't even leave a scratch on the tentacles.</p><br><p>"Hey, sorry for the intrusion, but I'm going to have to take her away. I think it would make sense to have one lady fighting against another, don't you?" Prago smiled bitterly before drawing his hand to his side.</p><br><p>Naturally, the Jade Lady couldn't resist, though every time she swung her sword she chopped off parts of the tentacles.</p><br><p>Then, Prago swung his arm sharply and tossed Jade Lady to the side, moving her from one point on the battlefield to a completely different one.</p><br><p>That wasn't the end of it, for Prago leaped forward, grabbed Jade Lady with his tentacles again, and lowered his gaze downward.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, below him, a few meters away was Tirana, who was watching Prago with wide-open eyes.</p><br><p>Deep inside, she hoped it was just a coincidence because Prago couldn't have done all this on purpose, could he?</p><br><p>Well... She was soon to realize that her hopes were futile.</p><br><p>"Good luck!" Prago smiled broadly, waving at her like an old friend before throwing Jade Lady straight at Tirana.</p><br><p>"Bastard!" Tirana exclaimed furiously, as her eyes shone brightly and a massive flaming sword appeared in her hand.</p><br><p>It seemed that Jade Lady was supposed to continue hunting Prago, but by the time Jade Lady reached the ground, Prago had already disappeared, ending up next to Obsidian Armadillo.</p><br><p>Jade Lady obviously realized that she couldn't defeat Prago, at least not without severe wounds, so she needed to choose an easier target.</p><br><p>Tirana bit her lip to the blood as she looked at the dozens of Ladies striving to defend their leader. She realized that she could have died in this battle because she was facing the third strongest monster a K1-Phantom like her could encounter.</p><br><p>Thus, Thunder Demon was left alone once again. Prago quickly made Obsidian Armadillo and Jade Lady find opponents, and only Thunder Demon had none.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>It was starting to really annoy him, Thunder Demon gritted his teeth, releasing outward electrical discharges from his jaw.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a water explosion occurred not far from Obsidian Armadillo Prago, who was already actively fighting. Then, a pillar of light and a flaming blast appeared in another part of the battlefield.</p><br><p>"ROOOOAAAAAAAAARRRRRRR!!!"</p><br><p>Thunder Demon roared furiously, releasing random lightning discharges, turning the salt lands around him into a field of molten black mass.</p><br><br><p>Before Thunder Demon decided to unleash his righteous anger, several misty arrows headed towards him.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon's eyes narrowed as he stretched forward his arm, catching the arrows and simply breaking them like fragile matches.</p><br><p>If North Keeper could stop Fred's most powerful arrow, it was no problem for Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>"Rgha... Rgha... Rghaa..." Thunder Demon growled while staring intently at Fred.</p><br><p>Fred was more than a hundred meters away from him, but his eyes were calm and filled with confidence.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon waved his hand nonchalantly as if to say, 'You may be weak, but I will fight you. It's better than nothing and endless boredom!'</p><br><br><p>Thunder Demon took a few steps forward, about to speed up, but something made him stop.</p><br><p>The monster abruptly turned his head to the side, only to see a black silhouette sprinting across the salt hills and rapidly approaching him.</p><br><p>Adam's legs were covered in electric shocks, and in his hand was a snow-white needle. He may not have been at peak strength due to fatigue, but that only limited his abilities. His physical stats and the needle were with him.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Thunder Demon realized everything as a wide grin appeared on his face, spreading across his entire face.</p><br><p>"Rgha...?" Thunder Demon got a baffled look when Adam disappeared behind the salt hill. The monster turned around, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't figure out where Adam, who was in his field of vision, was hiding!</p><br><br><p>Several salt crystals, quite tiny, flashed before Thunder Demon's eyes. In the last of them, he saw a dark spot that quickly grew larger, for it was Adam's reflection!</p><br><br><p>Thunder Demon roared, lashing his tail behind him, fully confident that Adam had circled him from behind.</p><br><p>However... The fist coming down on his face was clear proof of how wrong he was.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>All of Adam's muscles tensed to the limit, his punch was executed with perfect speed and trajectory, and his feet held him firmly to the ground, allowing him to unleash the full force of his body into a single point.</p><br><p>A pulse, traveled through Thunder Demon's head, making his skin tingle and spreading in waves across his face.</p><br><br><p>The massive body of the Thunder Demon flew off to the side, causing the eyes of all the spectators to go wide.</p><br><p>But... not even a second later, the Thunder Demon spun in midair, bringing his powerful legs down to the ground.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon's eyes narrowed as he licked the trickle of blood coming out of the corner of his mouth, while the flames of battle were actively burning in his gaze.</p>
