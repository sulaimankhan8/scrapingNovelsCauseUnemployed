            <br><p>What was Adam doing?</p><br><p>Well, he simply put his palms to the ground, activating his Nexus, the capabilities of which he hadn't yet demonstrated.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, after his defeat at Damien's hands, Adam's mind was filled with knowledge of what his Elemental Root and Nexus were capable of, but... some things were still unknown to him.</p><br><p>His Power Gene - Desecrated Sword, still showed no signs of life, remaining a mystery to Adam.</p><br><p>Douglas, Dahla, and Damien watched Adam's actions, some were puzzled, and some had just a mild curiosity.</p><br><p>However, Silvana could clearly see that Adam was now looking a lot like one of his strongest opponents.</p><br><p>'Steel Knight...' Silvana muttered internally. Looking at Adam's stance, she saw Steel Knight, who was ready to cause a shaking comparable to an earthquake with the vibrations he could control.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam's Nexus had nothing to do with Steel Knight. Only his Power Gene had a direct connection to Steel Knight, as it previously belonged to him and became part of Adam's power after his death.</p><br><p>But... something was certain, Steel Knight was part of Adam's history and himself.</p><br><p>The stronger the Phantom became, the more the Evolution Tree and inner space gained capabilities and energy, wanting to adjust to its owner.</p><br><p>Thus, even though his Nexus initially had very different functions and origins, things were now different.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Light vibrations came from Adam's palms, traveling across the entire chamber at high speed.</p><br><p>At first, the vibrations were faint, almost unnoticeable, but after a few seconds, the momentum peaked.</p><br><p>Energy passed quickly through the threads of Adam's gauntlets, making them shake like dozens of strings. All that power traveled down Adam's arms, straight to the ground, releasing calm and steady vibrations that soon led to destruction.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The stone slabs could no longer withstand the pressure, cracking and shattering.</p><br><p>Then, the same happened to the walls, reaching even to the ceiling, which was the only part of the chamber that had not yet been damaged.</p><br><br><p>Damien looked up, whistling at what was happening.</p><br><p>"Well, well, even though I said the military would fix it, there's just no point in repairing it now. They'll have to make everything from scratch." Damien rubbed the back of his head.</p><br><p>He felt a little bad for Douglas since with his words he gave Adam permission to use his Nexus.</p><br><p>But... Damien only felt it for a second, then he didn't care.</p><br><p>"Hah, not bad, not bad at all." Damien grinned widely shifting his weight from one foot to the other.</p><br><p>Even a man with his experience and perfect body control needed to make an effort to keep his balance, but this was just the beginning of the consequences of Adam's trembling.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crack.</p><br><p>The ground began to separate, causing Damien to jump from one slab of stone to another. Then, chunks of concrete began to fall from the ceiling like stalactites in caves. Some of them plunged into wide cracks becoming spikes, others crashed into the floor turning into obstacles.</p><br><br><p>Damien deftly jumped from one part to another, trying not to fall into the fractures. He didn't seem to need to expend that much energy on it, he was a K2-Phantom now, so... what could happen to him if he fell into the rift of some big crack?</p><br><p>Well, Damien had two good reasons for acting this way. First, he didn't want to lose his position and find himself in a tight place without being able to move freely, it was fraught with the risk that Adam would just crush him with attacks from above without allowing him to get out.</p><br><p>But... that wasn't as important as the second reason. Damien could easily block all of Adam's attacks and use this situation to his advantage.</p><br><p>'Damn, that looks threatening.' Damien internally muttered intently glaring at Adam before taking another leap.</p><br><p>His gaze was directed towards the cracks that were closest to Adam, about ten meters around him. They were different from all the others, for amongst the earth and concrete, Damien could clearly see the silver glint from the threads.</p><br><p>The threads tried to hide their presence, but every now and then they showed their tips or opened fully when they left the ground for a moment like snakes only to return.</p><br><p>'Hmm... I don't know if he can extend the radius of his threads more than ten meters, but he can probably control them to point them in one direction and reach a target that's further away from his protective circle.' Damien pondered, making assumptions regarding Adam's ability.</p><br><br><p>'That's probably his maximum. The trembling is gradually getting weaker, but the threads are in no hurry to leave. However, he doesn't have that much energy and strength to cover a large area with his threads, but... it's a dangerous ability, especially in Dead Lands against a mass of enemies.'</p><br><p>Damien nodded, before jumping away from the debris and heading for the ceiling, a concrete plan of action already in his mind.</p><br><p>Though Adam's Nexus changed significantly, but his weapon retained its original function of fighting against multiple enemies.</p><br><p>Damien was not a good target for Adam's Nexus, but he realized how terrifying this ability was on the battlefield.</p><br><p>If it wasn't Damien fighting against Adam, but dozens of monsters, each individually much weaker than Damien, Adam's Nexus would be enough to defeat every one of them.</p><br><p>The weakest of the monsters would fall into the rifts from trembling and lose the ability to move, then, if fate was not on their side, the earth would simply crush them with its might.</p><br><p>The stronger and smarter monsters would reach Adam, bypassing the cracks and trembling. They would have thought that Adam was defenseless since his palms were pressed against the ground to send shivers, so it seemed that there was no way he could defend himself.</p><br><p>But... as soon as these monsters got within ten meters of Adam, dozens of silver threads would emerge from the ground and pierce their bodies like sharp blades. The threads would do everything to protect Adam, so the monsters would die before they could even reach Adam.</p><br><p>It was a powerful ability, but like any ability designed to fight against multiple opponents, its effectiveness dropped when there was only one opponent and he was too damn strong.</p><br><br><p>Damien jumped to the ceiling, grabbing the edge of the slab. Then, with a sudden movement of his hand, he pulled on it, causing the massive piece of concrete comparable to a rock to move away from its mountings and fall, heading for the ground.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Damien let go of his hand and clutched his two short black rods tightly.</p><br><p>His eyes narrowed, filling with seriousness and precision.</p><br><br><p>With a few quick swings, Damien shattered the rock into dozens of pieces, each was a hard stone capable of bringing medium destruction when used properly.</p><br><p>"Wha..." Damien let out a strange wheeze as the muscles in his arms tensed to the limit and his gaze became more focused than ever during their fight.</p><br><br><p>Moving at his top speed, Damien attacked with his rods, but not the sharp ends but the blunt ones, for one purpose - to throw the stones straight at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide watching Damien's actions. What he was doing was possible both physically and technically, but... in practice, it required exceptional mastery and control over the body.</p><br><p>The speed, the trajectory of the attacks and the moderate force to not destroy the stones but to launch them at Adam like projectiles from a cannon were all necessary to make this improvised attack.</p><br><p>So, a few seconds after Damien jumped up, Adam watched as a multitude of rocks flew towards him at a dangerous speed.</p><br><p>'Wait... Should I even dodge? When I was a K1-Phantom, ordinary bullets or knives could barely injure my body. Now I'm a K2-Phantom, so... my defense due to body strength and energy has become much higher, that's for sure.' Adam pondered.</p><br><p>But... after a moment he realized that this could have been his fatal mistake.</p><br><p>'No... It's Damien... If during his attacks he channeled energy into the rods infusing the stones with it, then... Fuck! I have to run!' Adam inwardly exclaimed as he realized what awaited him.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam jumped as far away from his spot as possible, managing to escape the hail of rocks at the last moment.</p><br><br><p>A multitude of stones like missiles flying out of a cannon rained down in a single point, shaking the entire chamber and raising up a thick cloud of dust.</p><br><p>The sound and destruction were comparable to a powerful explosion, but they were just stones thrown with tremendous force and filled with energy.</p><br><br><p>Damien landed with a slight smirk on his face. The threads in the rifts were gone. As he expected, Adam had to keep his palms against the ground for his ability to work correctly.</p><br><p>"Good for you for stepping back, otherwise Dahla should work hard to get your life back, Hahaha." Damien smirked with excitement on his face.</p><br><p>Nodding slightly, Adam glanced at Damien.</p><br><p>"Yeah... That was dangerous. I couldn't make an attack like that, it was incredible."</p><br><p>Damien didn't respond anything to the praise. He only shrugged his shoulders carelessly.</p><br><p>"What's next? Do you have anything else left besides Nexus? You still can't make me bleed." Damien asked with a serious face. He was ready to end their sparring if Adam tested all of his abilities.</p><br><p>"Well, you're wrong."</p><br><br><p>Damien tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>Without further ado, Adam raised his arms, which went back to normal after two gravity blows.</p><br><p>Then, he turned to the spectator room, looking at Silvana.</p><br><p>"Hey, I hope you're enjoying the fight, but... cover your ears. I don't want you to get hurt."</p>
