            <br><p>Katrin watched wide-eyed as Nessa killed the monster using its horns as a weapon. It wasn't just humiliating, but also showed how much difference in physical strength there was between them.</p><br><p>"Rgh... I should already be fighting the strongest, but instead, I have to waste my time on trash like you. It's kind of annoying." Nessa growled, glaring menacingly at the two remaining monsters.</p><br><p>They were slightly smaller and didn't look as strong as the monster she had just killed.</p><br><p>Nessa's instincts were calm, if these monsters posed a threat to her, she would have sensed it. But... then she only felt completely superior to them and she didn't stop that feeling from slowly consuming her mind.</p><br><p>Whoooooooosh. Continue your adventure with empire</p><br><p>Running up to the first monster, Nessa thrust her palm into its throat, piercing the tough hide as if using a great spear.</p><br><p>"ROOOAAAAAAARRRR!!!"</p><br><p>The last monster of the trio realized that escape was impossible, the only option was to fight.</p><br><p>The monster opened its jaw wide, about to fight for its life.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Nessa turned around as her right leg came into motion. Her foot like a broad halberd blade, slammed into the monster's head from bottom to top.</p><br><br><p>The impact was powerful enough to tear the monster's flesh, and break bone, and the momentum threw the head aside like a ball.</p><br><p>'What the hell is going on here...?' Katrin internally muttered unable to believe what she was seeing.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam could easily handle these monsters too especially in his current state, Katrin realized that. However, she saw that Nessa didn't use her abilities as well as her Nexus.</p><br><p>Then, Katrin realized something.</p><br><p>'Oh, she knew where she was going, so she must have used her abilities while still in the fighter, right? Yeah, in that case, everything falls into place. Most likely her abilities are focused on body strengthening and physical power, it's not the most common case, but it's nothing unique.'</p><br><p>Besides Katrin, Nessa was also being watched closely by Osana and she did not share Katrin's thoughts at all.</p><br><p>She was completely sure that Katrin wasn't using any abilities, she just didn't feel any energy emanating from Katrin.</p><br><p>Because of the nature of her abilities, Osana was good at detecting this and she was more perceptive than Katrin, who just wanted to understand what Nessa was doing here. Osana needed to find out who Nessa was.</p><br><br><p>Nessa stepped forward, casting a careless glance at the three dead monsters lying at her feet. Her gaze dropped to her ankle. She felt a slight unpleasant burning sensation as if she had accidentally bumped into something.</p><br><p>When she killed Purple Threat monsters, this didn't happen. The monsters' skins were much tougher and their bodies stronger, and she had felt it firsthand.</p><br><p>'I see. Even if they're pretty weak they're still Light Yellow Threat monsters. Damn, and they're all afraid of that bastard?' Nessa pondered before staring ahead at Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>Adam and Plague Reaper continued to fight. They looked like black and blue flashes, disappearing from time to time only to reappear elsewhere in another clash.</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam glanced at Nessa before turning back to his battle against Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>Did he expect Nessa to show up here?</p><br><br><p>Only Magnus, Refesa, and Douglas knew about it.</p><br><p>Adam was surprised, but he had no time to express his emotions since every second of inaction could end with the black blade of the scythe cutting off his head.</p><br><p>Nessa frowned heavily, clenching her fists tightly.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly Refesa's calm voice sounded in her ear.</p><br><p>'Did you come here to fight and defeat the Top-1 monster or to watch Adam Vinter? As your temporary Operator, I strongly suggest you finally get to work.' Refesa said with a slight smirk on her face.</p><br><p>Nessa didn't like Refesa's tone, but she couldn't help but admit that Refesa was right. She had come here with a clear purpose and she had to fulfill it.</p><br><br><p>Nessa ran forward quickly, getting faster with each step.</p><br><p>The ground bore deep marks from her powerful stride as her eyes focused on Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>While she had flown here on XH-01, Refesa, and Magnus had told her everything she needed to know about Plague Reaper, as well as what fighting style these Crown Monsters used most often.</p><br><p>'Adam... I'm sure your opponent is strong, but with my help, we definitely can defeat him. Against the two of us, Plague Reaper can't do anything!' Nessa exclaimed internally before appearing behind Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>Nessa often went to Dead Lands to learn how to fight against monsters and gain real combat experience.</p><br><p>Her favorite opponents were Crown Type monsters, as she could use the full potential of her body to counter them.</p><br><p>Crown Monsters used not only their physical power but also real mastery gained through many victories in bloody fights. They were capable of both grappling and hitting vulnerable spots, so they were the best sparring partners for Nessa.</p><br><p>'Your abilities are actually frightening, but I gather you've already used most of them. I'm sure your skill won't be enough to surpass mine and my honed instincts!' Nessa internally belligerently spoke before guiding her palm towards Plague Reaper's back.</p><br><p>She was going to pierce his flesh with her palm like a spear to immediately give Plague Reaper a serious wound while she had the advantage.</p><br><p>Sure, Nessa realized that Plague Reaper had sensed her presence long ago, but he was still distracted by Adam and didn't know what Nessa was capable of.</p><br><p>'Yes... Almost, just a little more.' Nessa muttered inwardly looking at her palm sweeping through the wind currents like a sharp blade.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>A scythe with a long bone handle and black blade flew upwards from the powerful throw of its owner.</p><br><p>Nessa's eyes traveled upward for a moment, but she immediately returned her focus to Plague Reaper.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper's pale back palm touched Nessa's wrist, with enough force to pull her arm aside.</p><br><p>Nessa's surprised eyes reflected Plague Reaper's hand reaching for her.</p><br><p>Then, a shiver ran through Nessa's body, all her instincts screaming that she shouldn't let him grab her.</p><br><p>Nessa jumped back sharply.</p><br><br><p>Nessa flinched, realizing that she couldn't budge. Lowering her gaze she saw that Plague Reaper's foot was pinning her foot firmly to the ground, not allowing her to take a single step away from that spot.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper's fingers went through Nessa's crimson hair, clutching her locks tightly, with enough force to easily tear them out.</p><br><p>At the same moment, electric shocks erupted behind Plague Reaper, and a silver glint reflected in Nessa's startled eyes.</p><br><p>Well, Nessa had failed her first attack, but even so, she had distracted Plague Reaper and Adam was going to take advantage of that. If he could seriously wound Plague Reaper, Nessa was already proving useful.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper cast a quick, calm glance at Adam before running forward.</p><br><p>He dragged Nessa along with him, one hand holding onto her hair and the other grabbing her face.</p><br><p>But... Plague Reaper wasn't about to run away, for after a few steps he bent his body forward, forcibly plunging Nessa's face into the ground, causing it to claw against sharp rocks and literally bleed on the hard surface.</p>
