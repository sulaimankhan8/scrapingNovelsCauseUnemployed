            <br><br><p>The woman with the long brown coat brought the man to the ground with a series of quick blows, although they were fighting, she had no purpose to injure the man or bring him pain.</p><br><p>"Agh!" The man cried out, trying to get up and continue the fight, but he was unsuccessful. The woman was much stronger than him and wasn't about their skill or talent.</p><br><p>They were both Phantoms and were simply on different levels, the gap in their strength was more on an impassable gulf, so the outcome of their fight was known from the start.</p><br><p>But, the man hadn't come here to win.</p><br><p>His goal was quite simple - he like several other Phantoms came here to prove that he was strong enough to fight against Adam Vinter.</p><br><p>Sure, only a small fraction of the Phantoms from the Branch Squads of the Marzo Family decided to answer the call and volunteer.</p><br><p>However, the desire to accept the challenge and become the second fighter in The Rule of Power was not enough. The Marzo Family needed a victory, so they could only fight someone capable of defeating Adam Vinter.</p><br><br><p>The woman took a few steps back looking at the man who was shocked at how quickly he lost.</p><br><p>Then, she stared ahead at the remaining candidates and menacingly said in her stern voice: "Next! Hurry up! Don't waste my time! We must find someone who can stand up to Adam Vinter! I'm sure at least one of you will be a worthy fighter!"</p><br><p>The woman folded her hands behind her back, watching as the Phantoms chose which of them would go to try their luck next.</p><br><p>"Khm. Do you think any of them can pass your selection?" A girl, considerably younger, standing next to the woman asked.</p><br><p>The woman shrugged slightly with a deep sigh.</p><br><p>"Shall I tell you honestly? I don't know. The problem is that we don't know how strong Adam Vinter is. After he became K2-Phantom he hasn't done a single mission in the Dead Lands yet."</p><br><p>The girl's eyes went wide for a moment, then she nodded since it was true.</p><br><p>"So, we can only guess how strong he's gotten over the past three months, from the looks of it he's been training all this time." The woman waved her hand.</p><br><p>The girl was silent for a while before speaking: "I see, but he's probably become as strong as possible for a K2W0-Phantom, right? I mean, if that wasn't the case, then he wouldn't have participated in The Rule of Power, right?"</p><br><p>The woman's eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>"That's our basic position. Anyway, let's get back to work. Even though we work for the Marzo Family, we can't affect The Rule of Power in any way anymore, the fight is inevitable."</p><br><br><p>At that moment, the next fighter stood across from them.</p><br><p>And... a moment later, he was lying on the ground, unable to stand up.</p><br><br><br><p>Zarot and Mariel hoped that among the Branch Squads, there would be a strong enough Phantom, but they didn't put all their cards on it.</p><br><p>They had one option that was likely to lead them to victory on The Rule of Power, and that would force Osana to go back to her role as bride and marry Nirosh.</p><br><p>But, they might have to put a lot of effort into convincing this Phantom to fight.</p><br><p>"Really? He lives here?" Nirosh frowned as they approached one of the poorest areas of the Third Ring.</p><br><p>Sure, there were normal houses here, clean roads, and fairly quiet life, but compared to any place in the First Ring, this place was actually poor, it was evident in every detail from the condition of the roads to the look of the houses, everything was old and dilapidated.</p><br><p>To Nirosh who came from a great family, it was more like a slum in general, and he wasn't too much wrong since this neighborhood was almost on the border between the Third Ring and the slums.</p><br><p>"Well, it's his choice where to live, though I have to admit I'm as confused as you are."</p><br><p>Zarot said getting out of the car before glancing at Mariel.</p><br><p>"Didn't you say he worked quickly and efficiently since he needed the money?"</p><br><p>Mariel sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"That's true, but it seems like there's something we don't know. He got quite a lot of money for the missions he completed. Maybe it wouldn't be enough to buy a house in the First Ring, but it's sufficient to not live in the cheapest part of the Third Ring." Mariel explained before heading forward.</p><br><p>Reinal did not bother to go with them. He didn't see any need as he couldn't help them in the negotiations, so he decided it would be better to go straight to the ninth wing.</p><br><br><p>Mariel, Nirosh, and Zarot approached the old wooden doors. It was late, but a few of the windows were still lit, and a pleasant smell was coming out of the cracks in the door as if someone was busy cooking.</p><br><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p><br><p>Zarot knocked on the door several times.</p><br><p>They expected to hear footsteps on the other side and see the owner of the house open the door, but instead, there was only a rumble as if a storm was coming at them.</p><br><br><br><p>"Give it to me! You're always the first to...!"</p><br><p>Indistinct voices came from within the house, too young, as if from children.</p><br><br><p>With a loud squeak, the door opened, revealing three short silhouettes.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, they were three girls, about twelve to fourteen years old. They were teenagers by now, but they were still kids and were acting overly active.</p><br><p>The girls raised their eyes, looking baffled at Zarot, Nirosh, and Mariel, they didn't know what to say or why these people came here.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a tall figure emerged from the doorway.</p><br><p>"Hmm? We have guests?"</p><br><p>A young man with blue eyes gazed at Zarot and the others with a slightly surprised look. He was dressed casually and was now wearing a stained white apron, holding a large wooden spoon in his hand.</p><br><p>Mariel smiled kindly and stepped forward, walking past the girls.</p><br><p>"Hello Fromund. We haven't met, but you worked for my family, the Rouzet Family some time ago, you were in one of the Branch Squads and had a great performance." Mariel said quietly, standing in the middle of the aisle.</p><br><p>Then, Fromund's face changed slightly, for a moment he became serious, but regained his calm expression again.</p><br><p>His gaze traveled over Zarot, Mariel, and Nirosh, he nodded slightly and pointed toward the kitchen with his spoon.</p><br><p>"Don't stand outside, dinner's almost ready so come on in, we'd be happy to share." Fromund waffled nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"No!" One of the girls suddenly exclaimed.</p><br><p>"We only have four burgers! I'm not giving mine to anyone!" Elva, the older sister with chest-length hair exclaimed.</p><br><p>"I agree! We don't even know these people." Liv, the middle sister with shoulder-length hair puffed up her cheeks.</p><br><p>"Ughum! What's more, we still have pizza! I want to eat it all by myself!" Tilda, the younger sister, her hair only reaching to her neck, crossed her arms over her chest.</p><br><p>Nirosh frowned, looking at the girls with an annoyed look.</p><br><p>"Pffft. Do you think I want to eat some burgers and pizza from Third Ring? Keep those crap for yourself." Nirosh snorted.</p><br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda flinched at such a rude response and their faces turned slightly pale.</p><br><p>Obviously, this couldn't please their big brother.</p><br><p>Fromund narrowed his eyes and the wooden spoon in his hand was ready to crack.</p><br><br><p>Zarot's palm slammed into the back of Nirosh's head, a loud slap spreading throughout the house.</p><br><p>"Pardon this fool, we would welcome anything you offer us if you would be so kind, wouldn't we?" Zarot uttered, staring intently at Nirosh, his eyes were narrowed with a dangerous glint.</p><br><p>Nirosh wanted to be indignant since he didn't think he did anything wrong, but when he saw the gaze of his father he didn't dare to disagree.</p><br><p>"Yes... That's right." Nirosh gulped, scratching the back of his head which hurt a lot.</p><br><p>Read exclusive adventures at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Seeing this scene, the sisters' cheeks puffed up before they exploded in laughter.</p><br><p>"Hahaha! You're funny!" Tilda said.</p><br><p>"Pffft, it looks like he's just really stupid." Liv snorted, throwing a sideways glance.</p><br><p>"Agh, let's just go to the kitchen already. We've waited too long for this dinner to stand any longer." Elva shook her head, heading forward.</p><br><p>Tilda and Liv glanced over at each other before heading after their older sister.</p><br><br><p>Fromund approached Zarot and Nirosh, made sure his sisters were far away and could hear nothing, then he spoke in a cold voice, almost whispering: "The High Nobles came here, to the far side of the Third Ring at this late hour... It seems you are in desperate straits and need my help."</p><br><p>Before either of them could reply anything, Fromund took Nirosh by the collar, practically colliding their foreheads.</p><br><p>"In that case, you better behave yourself, you're in a foreign house, mind your manners."</p><br><p>Fromund calmly stated before his gaze grew darker.</p><br><p>"If you dare to be rude to my sisters one more time, you may not even think about my help. I'm sure it will be the worst possible outcome for you judging by what an arrogant bastard you are."</p><br><br><p>Fromund tossed Nirosh aside, he hit his back against the wall and his eyes went wide with shock and anger.</p><br><p>"Tsk." Zarot shook his head walking next to Nirosh, "Are you an idiot? This guy is your hope of getting Osana, and you thought it would be a good idea to intimidate his sisters?"</p><br><p>Nirosh gulped, he was too afraid to answer anything.</p><br><p>Mariel smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"Let's forget about this... unfortunate episode. We can still come to an agreement."</p><br><br>
