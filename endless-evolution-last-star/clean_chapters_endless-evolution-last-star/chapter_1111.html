            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1111: Touched Ones (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Phantoms couldn’t absorb energy directly like monsters, everyone knew that, but that only applied to Phantoms, not their Evolution Trees.</p><br><p>If it was necessary to advance further, for evolution or healing, a Phantom could absorb essences, such as the Midnight Crystal or even the Twilight Crystal, although this was a much rarer occurrence.</p><br><p>But if monsters could always absorb energy and Phantoms could only do so in specific scenarios to break their barriers, what about ordinary humans?</p><br><p>Well, for ordinary people, energy was destructive. Sure, it was all about quantity and source, but the threshold had to be very low in order not to harm an ordinary person and only bring benefit.</p><br><p>If a K4-Phantom with powerful healing abilities uses all of its power on an ordinary person, that person will simply die. It doesn’t matter that the energy is supposed to heal them; the pressure alone is enough to stop a person’s heart or tear them apart.</p><br><p>Sure, if the Phantom is weaker or a K4-Phantom controls the density of its energy, then all negative consequences can be avoided.</p><br><p>This is a scenario in which one person helps another, which is practically impossible in the Dead Lands where energy is everywhere, especially when interacting with the Midnight Crystal.</p><br><p>Nevertheless, right now, sitting in front of them was proof that it was possible. A human could absorb the Midnight Crystal.</p><br><p>“The Midnight Crystal?” Adam gasped. “You mean the shard is right inside you now? In your body?”</p><br><p>“Well.” Douglas lingered, smiling bitterly. “It’s only for the time being. I absorbed the Midnight Crystal a very, very long time ago.”</p><br><br><p>“How long ago? You look much older than the other K4-Phantoms. Although… Damn, you’re not a Phantom, are you?”</p><br><p>In any case, he had to know the answer.</p><br><p>“Hah, I’ll tell you. It happened several World Wipes ago. Hundreds of years have passed since that day, and the Midnight Crystal has completely dissolved in my body.”</p><br><p>Under Adam and Silvana’s shocked gazes, Douglas continued:</p><br><p>“At first, it was a large crystal that found a place in my chest. Then, it broke into large fragments, then into shards, until it turned into crystal dust before beginning to flow through my veins as easily as blood.”</p><br><p>Douglas waved his hand.</p><br><p>“To simplify it greatly, you can compare it to the Essence Type Monsters. Over time, the artifacts completely merge with their bodies, becoming part of them, but at first, the artifact is clearly visible and can even be removed.”</p><br><br><p>Douglas had practically described what had happened between Adam and the Essence Thunder Demon many months ago.</p><br><p>It is unknown whether Adam would have won if the Essence Thunder Demon had not had a weak spot in the form of its exposed core—the recently absorbed artifact. That was where Adam’s final attack landed.</p><br><p>“So, are all the members of the Gamma Division ordinary people like you who absorbed the Midnight Crystal? Are they all several hundred years old?” Adam asked, puzzled. “I mean, no offense, but the people who checked us before Heaven Island looked much younger than you or Andreas.”</p><br><br><p>Douglas laughed out loud as he emptied his glass in one gulp.</p><br><p>“Damn! How dare you complain about bad news when you’re telling me straight up that I’m a decrepit old man?! You need to learn some manners, Adam! Hahaha!”</p><br><p>In response, Adam rolled his eyes before taking a sip.</p><br><p>“Pffft, it’s obvious to everyone that you’re not weak. It’s just a fact. You’re old, that’s all!”</p><br><p>Calming down, Douglas nodded with a slight smile.</p><br><p>“You’re right, Adam. All members of the Gamma Division have a Midnight Crystal in their bodies. There’s no other way to get the power I have.”</p><br><p>Adam scratched his cheek. “I see, but if they all live quite a long time, how do they survive the World Wipe? It’s clear with you, that you’re strong enough, but I doubt that all members of the Gamma Division are capable of fighting on equal terms against a K4-Phantom.”</p><br><p>“Hah, now we’re getting to the interesting part. That’s one of the reasons why we’re trying to create new members of the Gamma Division, albeit very slowly. The World Wipe has virtually no effect on the Touched Humans. Well, unless they’re under Queen Elisa’s barrier, of course.”</p><br><p>With that, Douglas turned to look at the center of the floating island. Just like hundreds of years ago, Queen Elisa’s tree stood here, ready to protect them seven years later.</p><br><p>“But how is that possible?”</p><br><p>Douglas filled his empty glass.</p><br><p>“Well, because the Midnight Crystal is part of our bodies, we have very good resistance to the energy of the Last Star. Without the barrier, we wouldn’t be able to survive the energy of the First Star, but with the barrier, the shockwave is almost harmless to us.</p><br><p>“At least that’s what we’ve believed for hundreds of years. Even if a person absorbed the Midnight Crystal just a month ago, they would be able to survive the World Wipe.”</p><br><p>Adam was silent, he had nothing to say, unlike Silvana, whose gaze grew darker.</p><br><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes.</p><br><p>“So far, it all sounds too good to be true. There must be some very serious drawback, right? Something that prevents all humans from becoming the Touched Ones.”</p><br><p>She was right. If that were possible, the government would gradually fill the Citadel with Touched Humans until there were only Touched Ones left. In that case, the World Wipe would cease to be such a great threat.</p><br><p>“Of course there is.”</p><br><p>Douglas sighed heavily; even he found it unpleasant to talk about it.</p><br><p>“Firstly, there are relatively few Midnight Crystals. We break them down into small pieces so that humans can absorb them and so that we can use our resources effectively, but we barely have enough Midnight Crystals for the Phantoms, let alone to create millions of Touched Humans.</p><br><p>“However, that’s not the main problem. The probability of a successful procedure is our stumbling block. Hundreds of brave soldiers die to produce just one new member of the Gamma Division.”</p><br><p>With a stern look, Douglas clenched his fists tightly.</p><br><p>“Still, we’ll keep doing it as long as we can. We have to.”</p>
