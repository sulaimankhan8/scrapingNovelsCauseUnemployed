            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1156: Who leads the Crimson Path?</strong></p><br><p>Strangely enough, for Adam, the most important moment at the Corrosive Lakes was not his victory over Lyrod, who was a Flash Carrier and the target of his mission, but Frida’s spear, which saved his life for the second time.</p><br><p>He had seen the Lords fight, even a True Lord, although Saegar had not used all his power despite having to use his Lord Title. However, Adam had never seen what the Second Rank Phantoms were capable of when they were not holding back.</p><br><p>His training fight against Damien?</p><br><p>Now, he understood that Damien hadn’t used even 1% of his true power, and that he might have needed much less to defeat Adam. That’s not even taking into account that their fight had many conditions to weaken Damien as much as possible.</p><br><p>In silence, Adam ate in the hall at the spire. He had returned to base a few minutes ago, and all he wanted was to eat in peace.</p><br><p>No one bothered him, not Silvana, not the Gamma Division members, because he had completed his mission and deserved a rest.</p><br><p>What about the reward?</p><br><p>Sure, several million credits had already been transferred to his account, which was managed by Silvana. It didn’t matter anymore. The last time he had worried about money was several months ago when he was just a K2-Phantom or even lower.</p><br><p>At this level, money no longer mattered, as he was now part of one of the highest circles in the entire Citadel.</p><br><p>There were secrets, places, and tasks that even he did not yet have access to, but he was aware of most things, at least those that a First Rank Phantom was supposed to know.</p><br><p>If he or his family needed money or any kind of help, he could simply turn to the Gamma Division, as they combined the power of the military and the government, ruling the entire Citadel in secret from the public.</p><br><p>The only luxury he couldn’t have was what belonged to other Phantoms, factions, or the Twelve Branches, because that was part of their territory.</p><br><p>‘Hmm…’ Adam hummed thoughtfully, looking at the three meatballs in tomato sauce. ‘The Azure Lotus, the Dark Order, and the Crimson Path. Hmm, Damien with the Dark Order, Frida is the leader of the Azure Lotus, but what about the Crimson Path?’</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam had virtually no interaction with the three main factions, although this was not the case for most Phantoms.</p><br><p>Part of the reason for this was that Adam was always busy and rarely needed help from any of the factions.</p><br><p>In fact, he had once had a conflict with the Azure Lotus when he was imprisoned, and the Dark Order had once helped him when he was training with Tron and Max in an attempt to take the first steps toward breaking down the Two Walls.</p><br><p>But the Crimson Path?</p><br><p>Adam wasn’t sure he had ever met a member of that faction, and he didn’t even know who their strongest Phantom was.</p><br><p>The fork pierced the meatball as Adam raised it to his eyes, thick tomato sauce dripping down like dark blood.</p><br><p>“Well, they must also have a Second Rank Phantom at their head, but not just any Second Rank Phantom, one like Frida and Damien. I don’t know yet what the difference is between the Second Rank Phantoms, but Damien and Frida are a level above the others.”</p><br><p>Adam already knew that the difference in strength between the Lords was much more varied than between the Second Rank Phantoms, but he didn’t know what exactly set Damien apart from the other Second Rank Phantoms.</p><br><p>‘The Crimson Path… Unlike the Azure Lotus, who focus on maintaining order, and the Dark Order, who seek power, their main value is the purity of their blood.</p><br><p>Although it’s rather strange, blood purity definitely increases a person’s chances of becoming a Phantom, but can that matter considering that once every 250 years, everything disappears?’</p><br><p>He was thinking in the right direction.</p><br><p>No one who wasn’t strong enough was protected from the World Wipe. It didn’t matter if you were a simple person or a High Noble with incredible blood purity. Unless you were a K4 Phantom or one of the strongest K3 Phantoms, you had no chance of surviving even under the Queen’s barrier.</p><br><p>For blood purity to have any meaning even with the World Wipe, the children of two Phantoms had to reach K4-Level before the next World Wipe and not die, which was often a difficult task.</p><br><br><p>Adam put his empty plate aside and grabbed his favorite soda before heading upstairs.</p><br><p>“Whatever the Crimson Path is up to, I don’t think I need to worry about it. Although, it would be interesting to see their leader.”</p><br><p>Then, Adam’s eyes widened as he remembered something.</p><br><p>“Oh, right… the Red Feast. I haven’t been to that place in a while. Magnus said something about the head of the Crimson Path being behind it. Is… the food somehow related to blood purity?”</p><br><p>Different ideas came into Adam’s mind out of nowhere.</p><br><p>At one point, there were so many that he shook his head vigorously from side to side, trying to get them out of his head.</p><br><p>‘Fuck! Stop thinking about it! I have to find out where to find the Midnight and Twilight Crystals and understand what hearts the Path Construct is talking about!’</p><br><p>Thus, Adam ascended to the top floor of the spire in the teleportation chamber where the same people who had welcomed him to these lands were waiting for him.</p><br><p>The woman in the white outfit stepped forward as she bowed slightly.</p><br><p>“I’m glad you’re back, Mr. Adam. I watched your battle against the monster when you made it to the surface. It was impressive.”</p><br><p>Adam shrugged carelessly.</p><br><p>“Yeah, but not as impressive as the spear that destroyed half the area. Alright, it’s time to go home! I’ve got a lot of work to do!”</p><br><p>The woman smiled faintly and pointed toward the platform.</p><br><p>“Of course. Your Operator warned us, so everything is ready. We can begin at any moment. This time, the negative effects of teleportation will last for much less time. You can be sure of that.”</p>
