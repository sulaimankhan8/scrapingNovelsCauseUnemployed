            <br><br><p>What he heard sounded more like monster behavior, though... Adam didn't see monsters eating their kin of the same species. Even for monsters, cannibalism at this level was not common.</p><br><p>In fact, cannibalism was condemned by all of society for a very simple reason - it was most often murder and there were always ways to find food.</p><br><p>If there was no one else in the world except humans, and there were no fruits, vegetables, cereals, or any other source of food except the flesh of another human being, there would be no such term as cannibalism at all, because there would be no other way to find food.</p><br><p>But, this was a theoretical situation in an impossible world, humans and all other living creatures needed something to eat to grow muscles, which in fact was meat.</p><br><p>Even monsters would only resort to cannibalism in extreme cases because they could feed on other monsters rather than their relatives or what the distant regions of the Dead Lands offered.</p><br><p>"I don't even know what to say... Damn, is it even safe to go to the ninth wing? We won't have any problems?"</p><br><p>Stay updated with My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Adam asked uncertainly, running his fingers over and over.</p><br><p>Before Osana could say anything, a satisfied voice came from the driver's seat:</p><br><p>"Hah, don't worry, Kogen is a great guy, albeit a little weird. Well, you won't hold the power in the ninth wing any other way. It's a special place!" Gladius laughed briefly before speeding up and making a sharp turn, causing everyone to jump up in their seats.</p><br><p>Rosalind listened intently to the story about Kogen, even though she knew about it, it was interesting and frightening every time.</p><br><p>So, when Gladius turned sharply, Rosalind immersed in thought wasn't expecting it and didn't have time to grab onto something to keep her balance.</p><br><br><p>"Ouch!" Rosalind yelped as she crashed into Gladius.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, he didn't push her away, but instead threw his arm over her shoulder.</p><br><p>"Hey, I didn't expect you to be so active, but I don't mind." Gladius smirked, looking at the blushing Rosalind with satisfaction.</p><br><p>"No. It was an accident!" Rosalind exclaimed, almost in a panic before throwing off Gladius's arm and returning to her seat.</p><br><br><p>"Too bad, too bad." Gladius chuckled.</p><br><p>Adam shook his head, he felt sorry for Rosalind, Gladius was playing with her like a child and she didn't even realize it.</p><br><p>"By the way, about the ninth wing, tell me more about this place. I know all wings are different in some manner, but it seems the ninth wing, the last one, is special, right?" Adam asked looking at Osana.</p><br><p>Osana nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"You're not wrong. As far as you know, if we talk about ordinary people, they have different incomes on average depending on the wing where they live. So, on paper, a family from the first wing earns much more than the same family in the ninth wing, the difference between them is the maximum among all the wings."</p><br><p>She sighed heavily before continuing:</p><br><p>"Sure, that doesn't mean that the ninth or the eighth wing is a slum level, it's still the First Ring with its wealth and luxury. But... everything I said has nothing to do with the ninth wing."</p><br><p>Adam blinked a few times, not realizing what he just heard.</p><br><p>"Wait... How's that?" Adam tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>Osana glanced to the side, they were approaching the ninth wing, passing through a circular road in the center of the Citadel from where they could access any wing.</p><br><p>"Because the ninth wing is the most uncontrolled area of all. Mafia, bandits, robberies, incredibly high crime rates, contraband trafficking, where otherwise illegal drugs are the most harmless thing you'll find here."</p><br><p>With a wave of her hand, she went on to list the features of the last wing.</p><br><p>"Police or government officials don't exist here at all. Or rather, they do, but they work for some gangs or organizations that are most often subordinate to some specific families or individuals."</p><br><p>Osana directed her gaze at Adam.</p><br><p>"The military are in the same position and often work as mercenaries. And... with all things considered, this isn't some slum like I said earlier. It's a developing and thriving place, but operating under very different rules."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, silently listening to her. He hadn't expected a place like this to be in the First Ring. It wasn't how he'd envisioned the top of the Citadel.</p><br><p>"In the ninth wing, everything is run by either corporations or gangs/organizations, and it works just fine for regular people. Nothing is stopping them from working for some company, or baking bread at the bakery, ordinary people are just used to the fact that there might be a shootout in the street or some important person's car blowing up."</p><br><p>Osana smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"It's a place with perfect, agile competition using all methods. In the ninth wing, everything is ruled only by force, power, and money, there are no rules and laws, or rather in the ninth wing they are not followed."</p><br><br><p>"I mean, why would you seek help from laws that don't work if you own a restaurant? In the ninth wing, it's much more efficient to seek help from some organization or the corporation you work for. They'll solve all your problems, often with bribes to the police, military, and so on."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment. All this time he felt like he'd heard about his original home, though that wasn't the case.</p><br><p>He couldn't help but get the feeling that the ninth wing was the same as the slums in essence, but with more money, resources, and people, and a working system that elevated it to an absolute with its distinctive features.</p><br><p>'Yeah... not a gang of thugs robbing a counter, but a gang who, when attempting to do so, are confronted by an equally powerful force who already hold their territory.'</p><br><p>Toward the end, Osana waved her hand.</p><br><p>"And of course, all of this hasn't turned into utter chaos and become the ruins of civilization thanks to the existence of the Noukx Family. They operate like a canvas on which everything that happens in the ninth wing fits, and no one has the power to tear that canvas, thus forcing the whole region to operate according to established rules, but not governmental ones, rather like an ecosystem."</p><br><p>Adam smirked, for some reason, he got the feeling that he would be more than comfortable in the ninth wing.</p><br><p>"I take it, without reputation and power, you're a nobody in the ninth wing, and... Kogen Noukx is someone who is either feared or respected by every resident of the ninth wing."</p><br><p>Osana flung her arms out to the sides.</p><br><p>"I guess you're right. Being in charge in the ninth wing is like sitting on a throne in the hell kingdom."</p><br><br><p>Gladius suddenly laughed.</p><br><p>"Osana is exactly on the mark since you can't sit on that throne without being a demon yourself! Hah, at least inside." Gladius smirked insidiously.</p><br><br><p>Everyone was lit up by a bright light as they pulled out of the deep tunnel. Their trip that took over an hour was finally coming to an end, not much longer before they would be at their destination.</p><br><p>Far ahead, a few kilometers away, the lights were visible as well as the high walls - the entrance to the ninth wing.</p>
