            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1094: K4-Level</strong></p><br><p>It was unknown how much time had passed since the beginning of Adam’s evolution, especially considering the fact that they were in the inner space.</p><br><p>Sooner or later, it was coming to an end. The evolution was complete, as became clear with the last tremor of energy in the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana exchanged glances. His lips parted as he was about to say something when—</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With an active tremor, a massive dark orb the size of a great rock appeared in his inner space. Its darkness was the same as that of the Twilight Crystal, ancient and impenetrable like an actual black hole.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana could easily make out the dark orb in the inner space.</p><br><p>The dark orb did nothing, remaining a mystery to the confused Adam and Silvana.</p><br><p>“This? Could it be related to my further progress? Adam muttered.</p><br><p>Silvana nodded slightly. “I think so. I think it’s something like the Crystal Gates, but you’ll have to find a way to find out what’s inside. In any case, it’s not our top priority right now.”</p><br><p>“Yeah, it’s too early to move on, although…” Adam chuckled. “I know I’ll want to do it pretty quickly.”</p><br><p>Suddenly, a low voice came from above.</p><br><p>[This will be harder than anything you’ve done before, Adam…]</p><br><p>Adam turned, directing his gaze toward the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>“Do you know anything about this?”</p><br><p>[Unfortunately, no… Like you, I can only feel the energy of this orb. I compare the dark orb to the Two Walls and the Crystal Gates, and the situation is not promising. It will be very difficult for you.]</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam only smiled faintly and shrugged.</p><br><p>That was essentially what he had expected to hear. After all, there were no more Keys or the Lock, or chains holding back the power of the Evolution Tree. Now he had to do something completely different because he had another goal.</p><br><br><p>Adam approached the dark orb, casting his gaze over the mysterious object. The dark orb hovered serenely in the void, without the slightest tremor, rotation, or movement — a completely static object that seemed not to exist.</p><br><p>Adam could easily verify this, which is what he was about to do.</p><br><p>Under Silvana’s anxious gaze, Adam reached out his hand. His fingertip was about to touch the dark orb, but something stopped him.</p><br><p>“Agh?” Adam blinked in confusion.</p><br><p>No matter how hard he tried, he simply couldn’t move his hand any further. What’s more, he couldn’t feel anything. It wasn’t like he was pressing against a solid wall.</p><br><p>‘How strange, it’s as if there’s nothing there. If I need to find out what’s inside, how the hell am I supposed to do that?’</p><br><p>Then, Adam shook his head and turned back to Silvana.</p><br><p>He satisfied his curiosity and was ready to return to the real world, but something stopped him again.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A burst of flame erupted from his Initial Gene as it headed toward them both.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze appeared before them, but something in her baffled Adam.</p><br><p>“What? What happened to your hair?”</p><br><p>Once red, Lone Blaze’s hair, burning in flames, was now abundantly filled with white curls, strongly resembling Adam’s silver threads.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze sighed, her gentle eyes turning to Silvana and then to Adam.</p><br><p>“I was able to use all of your energy to create a new ability. When you’re ready, you can use it freely. However, your energy was so overwhelming, especially after you absorbed the Twilight Crystal, that it changed me.”</p><br><br><br><p>‘Now I see it. It’s not just her hair, she’s become a little taller and her gaze is sharper, as if she’s grown older and is only gaining advantages from age.’</p><br><p>“Will you be okay?” he waved his hand. “I mean, my power will only grow, so these changes weren’t the last, were they?”</p><br><p>Lone Blaze slowly shook her head.</p><br><p>“Don’t worry. All the changes that have happened to me because of your energy have only a positive effect on me. I hope you’ll like my work.”</p><br><p>Then, Lone Blaze’s frame trembled as she returned to Adam’s Initial Gene, which became her home. Now, only she and the Evolution Tree remained in Adam’s inner space, as it was unlikely that Moira would ever return here.</p><br><p>“Adam, I think it’s time for us to go too. Wilfred looked like he didn’t want to wait too long.”</p><br><p>In response, Adam turned his gaze to his Nexus. He felt the energy from his new weapon flowing through his body. Usually, this only happened when Phantom touched his Nexus.</p><br><p>Adam was used to this feeling, as his Nexus was almost always on him due to its convenient shape, but he still felt the difference clearly.</p><br><p>“Yeah, you’re right. What’s more, we still have to get out of here. Judging by the monsters’ auras, we’re at the very bottom of the Cave Grid. They’re much stronger than the Red Threat Monsters.”</p><br><p>Then, they closed their eyes as they exited the inner space.</p><br><p>The dark sphere that surrounded Adam during his evolution actively trembled, attracting Wilfred’s attention.</p><br><p>He lowered his gaze to the almost empty pack of cigarettes. He had only two left, not counting the one between his fingers.</p><br><p>Then, the dark sphere burst, revealing Adam and Silvana. Dense energy surrounded them, thickening around Adam.</p><br><p>“Almost on time. A little longer and you would have had to get out of here yourselves,” Wilfred took a drag, releasing a cloud of smoke.</p><br><p>Adam glanced to the side, and several monsters were still hiding behind the ice crystals in the distance.</p><br><p>They were too afraid of Wilfred’s aura to come even a step closer, but they couldn’t do anything about their curiosity.</p><br><p>Some of them, the bravest ones, had hunger in their eyes. If it weren’t for the energy from the dark sphere and Wilfred’s presence, dozens of monsters would have already attacked Adam and Silvana.</p><br><p>The bursts of his energy during his evolution had the same effect on the monsters as a light source on fireflies.</p><br><p>“Well? Ready to go home?” Wilfred asked.</p><br><p>Adam gave him a confident smile.</p><br><p>“Sure! I’ve had enough of caves and forbidden lands!”</p>
