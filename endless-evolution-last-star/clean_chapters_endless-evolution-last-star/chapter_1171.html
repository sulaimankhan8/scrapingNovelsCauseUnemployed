            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1171: To be alive or not? (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>When Adam encountered Mariam and heard her proposal for the first time, he immediately decided that he would not even consider it. Children and starting a family were not something he intended to think about in the near future.</p><br><p>He had other goals, he had to become as strong as he could be. However, in the end, Mariam’s words made him think.</p><br><p>Whether he liked it or not, she was right about many things.</p><br><p>The chances that he would be able to change anything in this world and save his family from the impending World Wipe were not just slim, they were practically non-existent.</p><br><p>Sooner or later, he would have to come to terms with the fact that the last day he would see his mother, father, and younger sister was coming. What’s more, he even knew when it would happen — in just seven years, when he turned 25.</p><br><p>After that, a new phase of his life would begin. As a K4 Phantom, he could live for hundreds of years and see several World Wipes. If he became a Second Rank Phantom, even a thousand years or more would not seem impossible, although Adam did not want to think about something so long.</p><br><p>“So…” Adam’s quiet voice rang out. “You think this is my best option?”</p><br><p>Mariam nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“In a way, you’re lucky. You won’t have to wait long for the next World Wipe, and in just seven years, you can get down to business. Not counting the Twelve Branches, very few Phantoms have living families, because the K4-Phantoms must be among them.”</p><br><br><p>Then, she gently touched his hand.</p><br><p>“I know you don’t like the whole idea because it means you’re accepting the death of your family in the future, but… It’s going to happen anyway, Adam. Don’t dwell on it and waste hundreds of years. It’s better to try to create a family of your own, where you’re the father, not the son. You have a good chance of succeeding.”</p><br><p>Adam got the impression that Mariam was trying to persuade him for some kind of benefit, but she made it clear that she was just one of many options.</p><br><p>Just… she was right, and Adam didn’t want to accept it.</p><br><p>“Fuck.” Adam sighed heavily as he leaned back in his chair. “The World Wipe, every time I hear about it and learn more details, I feel like shit. Damn, start a family? Mariam, I was a teenager myself not long ago. I’m just not sure I’m ready to even think about it!”</p><br><p>Mariam shrugged as she picked up her glass.</p><br><p>“Well, you became a K4-Phantom quickly, too quickly, so moving at a fast pace isn’t something you’re unfamiliar with. I’m sure if you decide to do this, which I hope you do, you’ll figure it all out quickly.”</p><br><p>She waved her hand slightly.</p><br><p>“The only advice I can give you is not to wait until the last day. You should make your decision three years before the World Wipe. That would be a good time to discuss everything with Silvana or the other women and start gradually eating large quantities of monster meat.</p><br><p>“In the best-case scenario, your woman should give birth to a child in the first year after the World Wipe. That way, in less than 20 years, you’ll know if that child became a Phantom or not. If you have several children, it will only increase the chances.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded, but then his gaze darkened as he bit his lip.</p><br><p>“Tsk, you’re right, it would be good if my child became a K4-Phantom, but… that’s the best case scenario. What about the rest? You’re carefully avoiding that topic.”</p><br><p>“Well, because it’s not the most pleasant topic, and you understand everything yourself.”</p><br><p>Gritting his teeth, Adam nodded.</p><br><p>“Yeah. If my children become Phantoms, most of them will die before reaching the K4 level. Also, the children who don’t become Phantoms, I’ll have to watch them die of old age in a hundred years or again from the World Wipe, won’t I?”</p><br><p>Mariam had no choice but to agree. Adam was right.</p><br><p>“Sure. Unfortunately, neither you nor I can do anything about it. Many Phantoms die in the Dead Lands, and ordinary people don’t live very long. That’s life, those are the rules we have no power over.”</p><br><p>Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>“You’re wrong. I have control over some things.”</p><br><br><p>“I can decide whether my children are born or not. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to have children knowing that most of them will die, either at the hands of a monster or from old age. There’s only a tiny chance that one of them will become a K4-Phantom.”</p><br><p>In exasperation, Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>“Who would want to be born into this world knowing the whole truth?!”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Mariam took his question calmly.</p><br><p>“You can ask yourself that question.”</p><br><p>“Agh? What are you talking about?”</p><br><p>Mariam glanced away.</p><br><p>“Your parents, Adam, decided to give birth to you in poverty, without your consent. Considering how much you know about the world, answer me one question.”</p><br><br><p>“If you had the chance to go back in time, would you stop your parents? Would you rather have been born or never have been born?”</p><br><br><p>The answer was obvious.</p><br><p>No matter how difficult things had been at times and what he had learned about the world, he simply couldn’t give up on life, not now, not when he was collecting scrap metal to sell to help his family.</p><br><p>“Fuck… Instead of helping me make a decision, you’re just making it more complicated.”</p><br><p>“Hah, I’m not going to force you. I just gave you all the options and made you look at the situation from different angles. The choice is yours.”</p><br><p>Then, Mariam slung her purse over her shoulder and got ready to leave.</p><br><p>“If you want to choose me, contact me three years before the World Wipe. I’ll be waiting. Also… If you want to join the Crimson Path, just contact me. We’ll always welcome you.”</p>
