            <br><p>Blood clots one by one crashed to the ground falling from Risha's battered face. Her lip was torn from one of a dozen skirmishes, her eyes practically empty and her heart beating rapidly trying to keep her alive.</p><br><p>Adam threw Risha forward, her body collapsing amongst the garbage face up.</p><br><p>Even though Adam was the winner, this fight wasn't easy for him as it was against three thugs. Hot steam was coming out of his body, his breathing measured and deep trying to calm down.</p><br><p>His eyes were bright compared to Risha's, but it had taken a lot of effort for him to defeat her. However, for him, it was only a fraction of that, while Risha was on the verge of death. Any attack would be enough to kill her.</p><br><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, the metal scrap crumpling under his boots. Energy surged through his body as he lifted his leg towering over Risha.</p><br><p>"Wait..." Silvana muttered breathlessly. "Adam... Are you going to kill her?"</p><br><p>"Yeah..." he wheezed. "That's right. This is the Lower Ring, Silvana. What's more, I promised her a fight to the death, so - that's the only logical ending."</p><br><p>Perhaps it was unnecessarily cruel for Silvana, but she wasn't going to stop Adam. She knew she had to adapt faster to the way the Lower Ring was set up, or they would be in trouble.</p><br><p>Adam's leg came into motion.</p><br><p>Silvana wanted to close her eyes, but she forced herself to watch the execution. If she didn't try to stop Adam, then she approved of it, at least that's what she decided for herself.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, an unknown figure appeared in front of Adam, smashing its foot into his, stopping Adam's strike right above Risha's face.</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Adam's body. He felt as if he had hit a steel beam.</p><br><p>Adam looked up to see a young man with short, the same spiky crimson hair as Risha.</p><br><p>'Who is this bastard...?' Adam pondered looking at the young man wearing a slight smile. 'No, more importantly. He's much stronger than Risha!'</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam bounced back and lunged forward sharply intending to deliver the attack.</p><br><p>But, before he realized it, a fist plunged into his stomach.</p><br><p>"Gha...!" Adam gasped in pain, being folded almost in two.</p><br><p>"Shh. I didn't come here to fight," the young man said in a sweet voice. "Hah, though at the Lower Ring that doesn't happen often."</p><br><p>Adam looked up, staring intently at the quiet young man.</p><br><br><p>"Oh? Did I forget to introduce myself?"</p><br><p>The young man pointed to Risha, who was looking at him with hope and a strange irritation.</p><br><p>"My name is Orel, and I am the older brother of that girl that shamefully lost to you in less than one minute."</p><br><p>From the last of her strength, Risha clenched her hand into a fist and kicked Orel in the leg. It was almost unnoticeable to Orel.</p><br><p>"I wish I could say I'll just walk away and leave you alone, but..." Orel's aura grew stronger. "I'm afraid as captain of the Red Bears, I can't pass up an opportunity like this."</p><br><p>Undeterred, Adam jerked towards Silvana, primarily concerned for her safety.</p><br><br><p>Orel's fist slammed into Adam's jaw, with enough force to knock him to the ground in one high-speed hit.</p><br><p>A dark shroud covered Adam's view as he tried to get up.</p><br><p>But, all he could do was watch as Orel threw Risha on his shoulder and moved slowly toward the trembling Silvana.</p><br><p>"No... Stay where you are..." Adam wheezed trying to reach Silvana.</p><br><p>Naturally, Orel didn't bother to stop, careless stride approaching Silvana who got into a fighting stance.</p><br><p>"Oh, going to fight?" Orel smiled slightly studying Silvana's posture. "Not bad, especially for an Operator from the Upper Ring, but you don't stand a chance against me."</p><br><p>Silvana was breathing heavily, her heart was beating vigorously while waves of goosebumps ran through her body.</p><br><p>She wasn't going to give up even if she couldn't win.</p><br><br><p>Silvana shifted as her fist headed for Orel.</p><br><br><p>Orel swept by her like a ghost, easily dodging her attack. Adam's eyes went wide for a moment, something similar to what he had seen from Erik at the end of their exam, except Erik was much faster and his movements cleaner.</p><br><p>With a shocked face, Silvana collapsed to the ground quickly losing consciousness.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Orel deftly caught her, throwing her onto the same shoulder where Risha was. He wasn't a giant so two girls could fit on his one shoulder, so he just threw Silvana right on top of Risha like a weight.</p><br><p>Before the darkness was to cover Adam, he heard Orel's voice.</p><br><p>"Don't worry. She'll be fine just like you. After all, I have to apologize for what I did."</p><br><p>'What...?' Adam's eyes closed seeing only Orel's boots. 'What's he talking about?'</p><br><br><p>Disregarding the four main organizations called the Four Beasts, the Lower Ring was divided into two main areas - the Outer Field and the Inner Field.</p><br><p>This worked the same as the ring system at the Upper Ring, but while there were three separate zones besides the slums at the Upper Ring, there were only two zones at the Lower Ring, at least for ordinary people...'</p><br><p>The Four Beasts shared the entire Lower Ring, both the Outer Field and the Inner Field.</p><br><p>Sure, there were many other organizations at the Lower Ring, but they were all subordinate to the Beast they were in.</p><br><p>However, it was easy to understand who was in charge at the Lower Ring thanks to the four towers rising at the Inner Field.</p><br><p>Each tower was different in color and bore the banner of one of the four organizations.</p><br><p>Obviously, for the Red Bears, it was a dark red color in an iron, gloomy tower as if it came from a dark world, sitting in the middle of the busy city streets like some skyscraper at the Upper Ring.</p><br><p>In one of the rooms of this tower, lay a young man who slowly opened his eyes, still feeling the ringing in his ears after his brief defeat.</p><br><p>"Gh...?" Adam wheezed dryly. "Where am I?"</p>
