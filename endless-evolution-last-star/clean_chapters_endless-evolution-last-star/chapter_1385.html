            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1385: Reward for the Lands</strong></p><br><p>For Adam, the battle at the White Spire, passing numerous trials, and defeating the enemy from the past, was a long and arduous journey. He would not have been surprised if it had taken him several weeks or even a whole month.</p><br><p>But, in reality, not even a single day had passed. He didn’t have to wait for the trials to begin. Everything moved at the same pace as him.</p><br><p>Additionally, Adam rested only once, and although he passed one more trial than all the contenders before him, it was still incredibly fast compared to his training to rebuild the Energy Axis, which had lasted several months.</p><br><p>Norax’s tea party, which had started 12 hours ago, was still going on because he felt that Adam would soon finish his stay on the island.</p><br><p>The others were still not so optimistic.</p><br><p>“Boss, I think you’re wrong.” Misty took a sip of tea. “It’s been quite a while, still, the Silver Beacon hasn’t shown a new light.”</p><br><p>Nollura gulped. “Do you think he’s dead?”</p><br><p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p><br><p>Karso scratched the back of his head with a complicated expression.</p><br><p>“Well, on the other hand, there hasn’t been a black flash either, right? Although Misty is right, Adam’s time is coming to an end. If the Silver Beacon doesn’t shine in the next hour or two, then we shouldn’t expect anything good.”</p><br><p>Watching them, Norax just grinned and crossed one leg over the other.</p><br><p>“Hah, what kind of bunch of pessimists are these? Do you think the young man hunted by the Befallen Crown will lose in some trials?”</p><br><p>Misty’s sharp gaze darted to him.</p><br><p>“Boss, if the energy of the White Spire decides to act, it could cause Adam to fail. I think you know what I’m talking about.”</p><br><p>Narica raised an eyebrow, puzzled. “The energy of the White Spire? Didn’t he die several hundred years ago?”</p><br><p>“This…” Norax bit his lip. “It’s a complicated situation. When such a powerful Ancient Artifact dies, it’s quite difficult to kill it completely. Something, some part of it, always remains. If Adam actually encounters this energy, things could get dangerous, but… I think he can handle it even so.”</p><br><p>Their argument could have continued for a long time, nothing was stopping them, because there was enough tea and sweets to last several months.</p><br><p>However, a slight tremor at the Silver Beacon was enough for all of them to turn in its direction at once.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Silver Beacon trembled as a crystal clear light flashed at its top, as bright as the stars in the night sky if they were much closer.</p><br><p>Nollura was the last to react, but she was immediately mesmerized by the beauty of the light.</p><br><p>“Is this… the crystal clear light you were talking about?” She asked in a trembling voice. “Does that mean it’s…?”</p><br><p>“Yes!” Norax slammed his fist on the table. “That means the little bastard made it, and my bet paid off! Hahaha, I was right as always!”</p><br><p>Adam hadn’t arrived yet, but the rewards for the Forgotten Mills were not long in coming.</p><br><br><p>A multitude of bright flashes burst from the Silver Beacon, crashing into the misty lands like meteors from the sky.</p><br><br><p>Each flash, upon reaching the surface, unfolded into a whirlwind of silver threads above which hovered a bright orb, full of energy.</p><br><p>Since Adam had gone to the Silver Beacon at Norax’s suggestion, the energy orbs only covered the Black Cut territory, leaving the Gray Needle and White Thread behind.</p><br><p>Perhaps for someone like Norax, Karso, Misty, and Narica, this didn’t matter much, but for Nollura and other members of the Black Cut, it could be a game-changer.</p><br><p>“This orb…” Nollura gulped, staring at one of the whirlpools. “Even from here, I can feel how much energy is in it.”</p><br><p>Norax smiled broadly.</p><br><p>“Exactly, and as you understand, these orbs are not of much use to me, but they will help you, Ureyn, and other members of our faction become stronger. What’s more, we’re the only ones who got them, and that’s not all!”</p><br><p>“Agh? There’s more?” Nollura turned around when, amid the bright light of the Silver Beacon, a multitude of threads appeared.</p><br><p>The threads headed toward the ground, filling both the surface and the deep, depleted layers with fresh, energy-rich air.</p><br><p>Some of the threads headed towards the borders of the Black Cut territory, especially towards the side where the crimson peaks began.</p><br><p>Now, Nollura watched as the Black Cut territory not only received many sources of energy but also increased in size as the threads connected with the crimson peaks and the misty lands.</p><br><p>Naturally, the other monsters of the Forgotten Mills couldn’t help but notice this.</p><br><p>Deep within the Gray Needle territory, an old man with a white beard frowned deeply.</p><br><p>“Tsk. Norax, that bastard. Did his crazy idea work?” Draug muttered through clenched teeth. “Who knew that one young man would cause so many problems? First, he took Ureyn from us, then he made the position of the Black Cut stronger? Damn it!”</p><br><p>Draug could be angry as much as he wanted, it wouldn’t change the situation anyway.</p><br><p>In most cases, Draug’s position would have been correct, as he was one of those who preferred not to take risks but to develop slowly and remain loyal to his techniques and the work of his allies.</p><br><p>The White Tread had similar beliefs. Among the three factions, only the Black Cut constantly took risks and was not afraid to incur the wrath of everyone else if they believed they were doing the right thing.</p><br><p>Obviously, the main reason for all this was Norax himself. Even Misty and Karso, who were his closest subordinates, would hardly have risked Adam’s life at the White Spire trials.</p><br><br><p>“As always, the boss was right, right?” Misty thought to herself as she looked at Norax, who was watching with complete delight as the bright light covered his lands.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a bright star streaked across the dark sky as the Silver Beacon emitted its last, most powerful pulse.</p><br><p>‘So it’s time to meet him.’ Misty nodded slightly to herself. ‘He’s done well. He really achieved his goal, and betting on it was an excellent decision.’</p>
