            <br><p>The show began, the hall was in darkness, and only the stage was not lacking in light from the bright spotlights.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana had center seats, having a perfect view of the stage, they were not too far away but not too close.</p><br><p>The theater production unfolded in a medieval setting, with knights, guards, bandits, princesses, and princes. It was a popular classic where both newcomers just passed their final exam and experienced actors could prove themselves.</p><br><p>Lona, a girl of medium height with shoulder-length blue hair and azure eyes, she played the role of one of the three princesses who wanted to become a prince's wife. However, this was not destined to come true as the prince was only interested in power and the coming war, not wanting to waste time on love.</p><br><p>Adam was bored, or rather, he did not find the performance itself interesting, but he was curious to see Lona, as she was Max's only relative.</p><br><p>Adam and Max were hardly friends, but they had been fighting every day for over a month and were in the same building for three months. They talked often and learned a lot about each other.</p><br><p>So, they were definitely not strangers, moreover, in Adam's eyes, Lona was the restraining factor that kept Max from becoming a Phantom. However, now, there was nothing else that could stop Max from going to the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>Adam's gaze was almost always on Lona.</p><br><p>Anyone watching from the outside would think Adam was a fan of Lona or had a crush on her, but he just didn't know where else to look.</p><br><p>Silvana had mixed feelings, watching the performance with a semi-bored look, leaning on her arm.</p><br><p>Her face was slightly frowning as she didn't expect that she wouldn't experience the excitement from the show. It wasn't about a bad performance or inexperienced actors, it was about herself. It was as if she was like a person who went from bland food to very spicy food and now could no longer enjoy what she used to eat all day long.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Damn, this is weird. I feel like this is no different from the many times I've been to theaters. On the contrary, it's a surprisingly good show, yet... I can't escape the feeling that I'm not impressed.'</p><br><p>Silvana glanced at Adam, who was watching Lona with a calm gaze.</p><br><p>'Well, watching him fight in Dead Lands, and fight against Tron and Max in live action, is more exciting than a predictable theatrical production.'</p><br><p>After a while, as the performance approached its midpoint, Adam decided to glance around.</p><br><p>Besides the standard rows where they sat, there was also a second floor behind where there were cheaper tickets since the seats were much farther away.</p><br><p>However... the seats on the first floor weren't the most expensive.</p><br><p>On the sides of the theater, on the level between the first and second floors, there were many chambers. Each chamber had a great view of the stage, but from below, one could not see what was inside.</p><br><p>Adam looked toward one of the chambers for a while before leaning over to Silvana and whispering: "What are those places at the top? Who is up there?"</p><br><p>In any other situation, Silvana wouldn't have started a conversation during the performance, but she saw this as an opportunity to dispel her boredom. She couldn't pass up a chance like this.</p><br><p>Silvana smiled and headed towards Adam's ear so as not to disturb anyone.</p><br><p>"These are chambers for very important guests. I don't know how many of them are occupied, but most often nobles sit there, especially those from the Twelve Branches. Well, there's room for other influential people there too, if you know what I mean..."</p><br><p>Adam nodded as he returned to his seat.</p><br><p>He expected to hear a similar response, after all, they were in the First Ring, specifically in the eighth wing, so he went back to watching the show, immersed in his thoughts.</p><br><p>'Max... So even though you have the ability to become a Phantom at any moment, you've held back for years and all for her?' Adam pondered, staring intently at Lona.</p><br><p>Adam rightfully thought Max was a unique person. He didn't know for sure, but he was certain that there were very few people with such fighting skills because sooner or later, they became Phantoms.</p><br><p>'I don't know if it's your decision or if you promised someone to take care of her, but it's the right thing to do. I doubt she could successfully get through her tests if she lost the last person close to her.'</p><br><p>Pondering Adam, slowly turned around, looking at Silvana, who was trying to force herself to show any interest in the performance.</p><br><p>'Yeah, to have someone so near and dear is a real stroke of luck.'</p><br><br><p>Silvana felt a push in her shoulder, she turned around and was about to say something, but no sooner had the words escaped her lips than her eyes went wide.</p><br><p>Adam leaned his head against her shoulder, watching the performance with a slight smile on his face. Now, the show was not the most important part of this evening.</p><br><p>Silvana was confused for the first few seconds, but she certainly wasn't going to disturb Adam.</p><br><p>'Ah... This training was the best decision Adam has ever made in all the time we've been together.'</p><br><p>Silvana internally muttered with a happy smile on her face.</p><br><p>'Not only did Adam get stronger and a bit more mature during this time, but our relationship has become notably closer. I always thought that once I became an Operator, I would just do my job well, but...'</p><br><p>Silvana looked at Adam again as her left hand came into motion. Almost instinctively, following only her inner desires, she put her arm around Adam's shoulder, as if trying to pull him even closer to her.</p><br><p>'Already in the first weeks, I realized that having a purely working relationship is not an option for me, nor any Phantom or Operator. We're together all the time and our relationship only grows as we care for each other.'</p><br><p>Her eyes dropped down to her metal bracelet, it was a gift that let Silvana properly release her emotions for one evening, and Adam took it all in.</p><br><p>Slowly, Silvana let out a deep sigh, just enjoying the current situation, completely immersed in her thoughts. For a few minutes now, she was unaware of what was happening on stage, though her gaze was directed there.</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam smiled faintly, he was glad that Silvana not only didn't refuse him but moved into action herself.</p><br><p>'Hah... I guess it's pretty weird since we have to switch places, but... I'm fine with it.' Adam muttered internally before closing his eyes, feeling the warmth from Silvana's hand caressing his shoulder.</p><br><p>The next time Adam opened his eyes wasn't until an hour later when the show was over.</p><br><p>The lights in the audience that were off all this time turned on, and that woke Adam up, forcing him out of his sweet slumber.</p><br><p>"I guess I shouldn't ask you about the ending, you didn't see anything anyway, right?" Silvana said with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>Adam glanced at the stage, the corners of his lips curved up.</p><br><p>"Well... I have a couple of guesses, but I don't think it's important right now."</p><br><p>Silvana nodded, looking at the people leaving the auditorium, but... hardly any of them were going home.</p><br><p>"Come on, we shouldn't be the last to arrive at the banquet."</p><br><p>Silvana said, getting up from her seat.</p><br><p>"Banquet...?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p>
