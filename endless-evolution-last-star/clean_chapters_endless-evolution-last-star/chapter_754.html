            <br><p>The change in temperature, the new irregular energy and the four ice towers all significantly changed the battlefield and the balance of power, the monsters had new targets and problems besides directly attacking the fortress.
</p><br><p>However, the battle between Katrin and the Dormant Lord has not lost its relevance at all. It didn’t matter that the frost monsters were now defending the towers, that the fire monsters were weaker and focused on fighting the fog, all of that was irrelevant in front of the Dormant Lord’s victory.
</p><br><p>If he needed to he would destroy all four towers in less than a minute and return the situation to its previous state. None of the ice monsters or Phantoms would be able to stop him, well... at least one of them tried.
</p><br><br><p>Katrin crossed two black swords in front of her as the Dormant Lord’s fist slammed into her very center.
</p><br><p>The impact went through her entire body with a deafening shudder, the momentum made her arms go numb but she managed to stay on her feet.
</p><br><p>Stay connected via Freewebnovel
</p><br><br><p>Her eyes reflected a white fist, in a heartbeat smashing into her face. This time the momentum threw Katrin back several meters.
</p><br><p>Yet, she struggled but managed to regain her balance, slipping back a few meters. Her torso tilted forward, her legs bent and her short sword thrust into the ground, she stared ahead at her opponent who, unlike her, stood confidently on his spot.
</p><br><p>Katrin’s eyes lost their former light, the flame surrounded by darkness still burned, but it was dimmer and weaker, significantly.
</p><br><p>Blood dripped from the corners of her mouth, her coat had crimson stains in many places, and her entire body was covered with numerous bruises.
</p><br><p>In a way, she was lucky that the Dormant Lord didn’t use his light blades, unleashing the full power of his fists on her, but it didn’t bring her any closer to victory.
</p><br><p>"Fuck... Why are you so strong... Shit..."
</p><br><p>Katrin spat out a clot of blood, wiping her mouth.
</p><br><p>"I’m unlucky, though I have powerful abilities, but... the Dormant Lord, his light just destroys my darkness."
</p><br><p>Alan felt that Katrin was at her limit both physically and mentally. They both realized that her defeat was coming and there was nothing anyone could do to stop it.
</p><br><p>’I think you should retreat. There are plenty of Phantoms in the fortress, albeit with a lot of casualties, but you can defeat him. Katrin...’
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Alan continued:
</p><br><p>’I know how you feel about this, but it’s a hundred times better than you dying... Please think of yourself.’
</p><br><p>Katrin’s gaze grew darker, she bit her lip and shook her head with a heavy sigh.
</p><br><p>"I can’t back out, even if I run away then besides the Dormant Lord, we have a second problem-"
</p><br><p>Before she could finish, her expression froze - a tall silhouette appeared in the distance, its aura was no weaker than the Dormant Lord’s, though it was as calm as a lonely frost.
</p><br><p>"It’s..." Katrin gulped staring at the Blind Sinner, "That’s the Blind Commander? Do they look like that? Shouldn’t he be badly injured...?"
</p><br><p>Her voice trembled and her eyes were full of disbelief. Then, the Blind Sinner slowly stepped forward, his chains, his lean build, and long sword giving him an intimidating appearance.
</p><br><p>Yet, no matter how hard Katrin tried, she couldn’t help but stare at his bright eyes. They were all-consuming and majestic.
</p><br><p>Alan told her that it was the Blind Sinner, what happened on the spire, but she didn’t listen as if under a powerful hypnosis.
</p><br><p>It wasn’t until the Blind Sinner was right in front, when a shadow fell over her, that Katrin finally came to her senses.
</p><br><br><p>She looked up, the Blind Sinner towering over her, but for some reason, her instincts remained calm.
</p><br><p>Alan didn’t understand that, he was screaming for her to run away - one swing of the ice sword was enough to end Katrin’s life, but... the Blind Sinner wasn’t going to fight her.
</p><br><br><p>Taking a step back, the Blind Sinner thrust his sword into the ground and pointed at Katrin, he slowly moved his hand to the rest of the Phantoms, only to them.
</p><br><p>Then, he showed one finger, Katrin quickly realized what he meant:
</p><br><br><p>Katrin blinked a few times trying to understand his gestures.
</p><br><p>"Are you talking about the first Phantom to come here? About the Unknown Phantom?"
</p><br><p>For some reason there was hope in her eyes, she wanted to know what the Blind Sinner was going to tell her.
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the Blind Sinner nodded deeply showing that she was right.
</p><br><p>Then, he reached his other hand forward, slowly unclenching his fist. The bloody bandages lay in his palm, the next stream of wind blew them away, but the message reached Katrin - that blood, the wounds that soaked the bandages of the Blind Sinner, it was all done by the Unknown Phantom.
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, the Blind Sinner squatted down, his eyes level with Katrin’s.
</p><br><br><p>His hand turned into a shadow, pulling out a black bug from beneath a layer of sand it was trying to hide from the rapidly falling snow.
</p><br><p>The bug’s legs twitched quickly from side to side, trying to break free from Blind Sinner’s death grip.
</p><br><br><p>His two fingers flexed slightly, crushing the bug no harder than a seed. Then, the Blind Sinner stood up, pulled his sword out of the ground, and tossed the bug aside.
</p><br><p>Taking a step forward he looked at Katrin over his shoulder and pointed at the bug, his eyes were full of disappointment and contempt, to him she and the bug had no significant differences.
</p><br><p>Naturally, Katrin realized this, her confusion quickly changed to blind rage. She had gone through too much, her pride was practically trampled by this one move.
</p><br><p>"You bastard! I may not have won and I may be weaker than the first Phantom, but I won’t let myself be compared to some bug!"
</p><br><p>In a burst of rage, Katrin clenched her teeth to a crunch pouncing on the Blind Sinner with all her strength.
</p><br><br><p>Before her swords could reach his back, a heavy chain reflected in her eyes, throwing her dozens of meters back into the clumps of snow near the closest hill.</p>
