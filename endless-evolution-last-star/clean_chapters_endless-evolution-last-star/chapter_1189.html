            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1189: No Chase (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>The Corrupted Volcano was located quite far from the Thunder Peaks, although these territories shared a border. This was one of the reasons why the Kirani Queen had made a deal with Bathild.</p><br><p>So, Bathild and her people would need time to reach the Kirani Colony. Neither he nor the other monsters under Bathild’s command would end up at the Corrupted Volcano, as they would immediately be transported to the Kirani Colony.</p><br><p>In the underground of the Thunder Peaks, there was a direct path from the ruined kingdom straight to the depths of the Kirani Colony.</p><br><p>The Kirani Bugs and thunder monsters rarely used this path, as they rarely had any joint matters. However, now that the Kirani Queen had asked for help, which she was fully entitled to under the agreement, the situation had changed.</p><br><p>Marhen went to the underground level, while Bathild remained at the top of the highest peak. She had no intention of going underground to lead her people, she always left that task to Marhen, who was a much better commander than she was.</p><br><p>Bathild was the leader of the Thunder Peaks for another reason—she was the strongest.</p><br><p>The thunder monsters would follow Marhen through the underground passage straight to the Kirani Colony because they knew that Bathild would be there before them.</p><br><p>For some reason, the Kirani Queen had decided to ask them for help. They knew that as long as Bathild was on their side, they could accomplish any task.</p><br><p>As a result, they will get the Twilight Crystal.</p><br><p>Sure, it will go to Bathild, but that wasn’t a problem for the thunder monsters. On the contrary, they, like Marhen, wanted Bathild to become as strong as possible.</p><br><p>If she goes through a few more evolutions, she will reach the level of the Lords and become a Baron.</p><br><p>This was the best scenario for all the monsters that had remained in one region for a long time and obeyed some monster. In this case, they could count not only on a bright future and denser energy in the territory due to Bathild’s influence, but also on something more crucial — survival.</p><br><p>The World Wipe will happen very soon.</p><br><p>The Black Threat monsters could survive the World Wipe, but only if they were under the protection of a more powerful monster.</p><br><p>The phantoms were in the same situation. If it weren’t for Queen Elisa’s barrier, the situation would have been much worse for them.</p><br><p>Sure, Damien, Frida, and the other Second Rank Phantoms were strong enough to create their own barriers.</p><br><p>However, those barriers would not have been as large as Queen Elisa’s, and there was another reason why they would not have been as effective as a barrier created by a Lord.</p><br><p>Unlike humans, monsters were similar to each other on the deepest and most fundamental level because they were born from energy.</p><br><p>Sure, many monsters were born in different ways, but they still had the energy of their parents, and unlike humans, who were always born as ordinary people, a monster could be born quite strong right away.</p><br><p>The young Kirani Bugs were not the White Threat Monsters; they immediately turned out to be the Yellow Threat ones and very quickly reached the Black Threat Level, all thanks to their energy and bloodline.</p><br><p>This was impossible for humans; their blood and energy did not work the same way.</p><br><p>The best humans could hope for was to increase the chances of their children developing the Spark. Mariam explained this to Adam in detail, but that was pretty much the extent of the advantages of having strong parents.</p><br><p>Thus, if humans did not have Queen Elisa, even Damien would not have been able to save many people.</p><br><p>Only those K4-Phantoms whose genes were quite similar to his would have survived. If it had been Frida or any other Second Rank Phantom, the situation would have been similar.</p><br><p>Queen Elisa’s energy was special, as was her current state; she was dead and alive at the same time, being the eternal guardian of all humanity. Well, only if it was a Phantom, a strong enough Phantom.</p><br><p>Monsters didn’t have that problem.</p><br><p>Any Lord, even if it was a young Baron, could protect many Black Threat Monsters. They were all connected to each other. They didn’t need similar genes, and their overall resistance to the World Wipe was slightly higher than that of humans.</p><br><p>Unlike humans, who only received the energy of the First Star and Last Star after reaching K3 and K4 levels, monsters were born with the energy of two stars in their bodies as their foundation.</p><br><p>So, for every monster of the Thunder Peaks, Kirani Queen’s call for help was good news.</p><br><p>Well, only if they and Bathild could kill the intruders, the two Phantoms who had forced Kirani Queen to take this desperate step.</p><br><p>The thunder monsters had no doubts about that.</p><br><p>With broad grins on their faces, licking their fangs, they looked at Marhen, who announced the plan of action and their leader’s decision.</p><br><p>Many weaker monsters looked at the Black Threat ones with envious glances. Marhen saw no point in taking the Red Threat monsters with him against the two K4-Phantoms.</p><br><p>That would only put the monsters at unnecessary risk.</p><br><p>But Bathild was the most excited of all.</p><br><br><p>With a mad gleam in her eyes, she lunged forward, leaping from the highest peak. The ground behind her cracked as rocks fell, but Bathild had no intention of landing on the ground.</p><br><p>The raging lightning ahead did not scare her; these were her companions, for of all the monsters at the Thunder Peaks, she was the strongest in this element.</p><br><br><p>Condensing behind her an energy that looked like a cluster of electrical discharges, Bathild leaped forward, leaving behind a lightning blast.</p><br><p>“Alright, Adam Vinter, show us what you’ve got. Show us why the First Star invited you to the Dark Shore, show us why you’re one of the few stellar Phantoms.”</p><br><p>She chuckled, anticipating not only their fight but her future.</p><br><p>“K4-Phantom with two star energies in his body. Perhaps this will be my reward instead of the Twilight Crystal!”</p>
