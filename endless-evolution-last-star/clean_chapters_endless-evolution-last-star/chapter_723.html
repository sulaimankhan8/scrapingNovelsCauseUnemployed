            <br><p>Events above had just begun to gather momentum, but the essential things that could change everything were happening in the depths of the fortress.</p><br><p>With a loud crack the massive gates slowly opened, crimson mist came out filling every crevice, it did not run like a wild wind from the shockwave, the mist was a hunter looking for worthy prey.</p><br><p>Adam watched the fog like a mesmerized man, the darkness behind the gate growing larger as the gate moved.</p><br><p>As the fog came, the energy began to change, making it not only denser but completely replacing its effect.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam could feel it in the coldness running down his arms, going along his back.</p><br><p>'What a strange feeling... I've been standing in the same place for a while now, but I can feel that the energy changed.'</p><br><p>Very soon Adam realized that it wasn't just the saturation of the energy, but its qualities as well.</p><br><p>With the arrival of the crimson mist, a new Irregular Energy appeared, with new unknown effects.</p><br><p>"Hey, Silvana, I don't know if you've only noticed it visually, but this energy has its own features. Do you have any information about it?"</p><br><p>However, for a long time, there was only silence on the other side. Silvana did not ignore him, she would not dare to do so. Gradually, Adam got an answer, though she didn't say a single word. He knew her too well.</p><br><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, his eyes closed pondering the situation.</p><br><p>"So you know nothing about the gate or this mist, and... the effects of the Irregular Energy are also unknown..."</p><br><p>Soon, a humble whisper was heard.</p><br><p>'Yes, sorry... No record of the Fortress of Lone Serpent mentions this gate as well as crimson mist. Some things changed like runes, some stayed like Shadow Walkers and Commanders, but... some things were never known about...'</p><br><p>"Good, I'm perfectly fine with that."</p><br><p>Without haste, Adam stretched his shoulders, waiting for the gate to fully open. The loud creaking and rumbling of stalactites falling from the ceiling didn't bother him, he tried to remain calm, but he had a hard time doing so.</p><br><p>Now and then, a wide grin tried to break out on his calm expression, his anticipation was too strong to keep it in check.</p><br><p>However, soon, Adam's face hardened as his eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>From far away, a strange, clicking, half-squeaking sound echoed through the cave like a frightening but clumsy roar.</p><br><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.</p><br><p>With a loud crunch of throbbing muscles, a shadow slowly emerged from the darkness behind the gate.</p><br><p>Two red legs stepped crookedly, seemingly ready to fall at any moment, but they managed to maintain a fragile balance.</p><br><p>The crimson skin covered the ghoul-like creature, it possessed an anthropomorphic build and was no bigger than a man, but... something was not right with the monster.</p><br><p>Adam gulped, goosebumps went down his body.</p><br><p>"What the hell...? Who did this?"</p><br><p>The monster had arms, but it couldn't use them because of the wide chunks of quivering flesh covering it on all sides like a shell. Bumps from the twitching elbows were visible here and there, but the monster had no way to get out of its confinement.</p><br><p>Tentacles grew from the monster's back... no... it was more like bloodthirsty vines, feeding not on water and sunlight but on the blood and suffering of both its host and its victims.</p><br><p>The vines moved vigorously, bending at strange angles, trying to find someone to satisfy their hunger. They had no eyes or sense of smell, but they were excellent at detecting energy, better than anything else.</p><br><p>'Why...? Why is this creature here?'</p><br><p>Silvana's uncertain, lost voice stumped Adam. He realized that she knew nothing about the gates and crimson mist, yet she recognized this strange monster.</p><br><p>'Adam, this is the Sacrificial Holder, Mid Yellow Threat monsters and they're usually pretty weak since they don't have any unique abilities. I mean, their energy and physical power are high, so they are Mid Yellow, with nothing unique about them.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Silvana continued:</p><br><p>'But... Those vines aren't in any of the images in the database, not in any of the several hundred... Even the Prime Ones have never noticed anything like that.'</p><br><p>"Well, he can't use his hands even though he has them, so I'm just going to assume these vines are his weapons."</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, extending his right arm out to his side. Silver particles slowly emerged from the energy streams, piece by piece gathering into a long needle, into Adam's first and primary weapon.</p><br><p>So far, it was the only part of him that hadn't changed dramatically. His essence, his beginning remained at his original firm point.</p><br><p>Gusts of wind gently passed over the top of the blades like a snow-white veil, noble and sure of its victory.</p><br><p>With an unpleasant crunch, the Sacrificial Holder turned to Adam, his jaw swaying from side to side. A long purple tongue lay between black teeth, and deep-set eyes peer out from beneath taut skin.</p><br><p>"RRRRRRRSSSSSSSKKKKK!!!"</p><br><p>A deafening scream rang out from Sacrificial Holder's throat as he opened his mouth wide. Explore stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>It was the beginning of the battle.</p><br><p>Adam's corners of his lips went up, feeling that something he had waited so long had begun.</p><br><p>"Let's go, this is it!"</p><br><br><p>The vine shuddered abruptly, turning into a swift shadow. Before Adam could realize anything, the vine swept through the cave like a harpoon jabbing into his left shoulder.</p><br><br><p>Streams of blood rushed outward, Adam's eyes grew wide and his smile changed to a shocked expression. He couldn't believe it happened, but the vivid pain and drops of blood flying in front of him were real.</p><br><br><p>Without a moment's hesitation, Adam sliced the vine in two and lunged forward quickly finding himself in front of Sacrificial Holder.</p><br><p>There was no hesitation or pity in his gaze. He knew he had to destroy his opponent right here and now.</p><br><p>With a precise long swing, he sliced off the monster's head, but he didn't stop there.</p><br><p>Slash. Slash. Slash.</p><br><p>Silver flashes appeared one after another, several per second, following the lightning-fast movements of the long needle.</p><br><p>Even chunks of flesh flew off to the sides until there was nothing left of Sacrificial Holder but two legs, everything else no longer able to be put back together.</p><br><p>"Fuck... What was that? How can he be weak...?"</p>
