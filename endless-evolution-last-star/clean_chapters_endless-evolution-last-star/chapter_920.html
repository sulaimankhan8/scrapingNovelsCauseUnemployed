            <br><p>The three thugs attacked Adam primarily because they needed Silvana. Adam and Silvana were not idiots, they were well aware of the purpose of needing a beautiful young girl even if they didn't explain it.</p><br><p>When they found out that she was an Operator, her value in their eyes skyrocketed. To one degree or another, Adam understood why that was so.</p><br><p>However... Risha paid no attention to Silvana. Adam wanted to understand why.</p><br><p>Risha pointed at Silvana, answering Adam's second question.</p><br><p>"You people from the Upper Ring don't know how things work around here, do you?"</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly. Risha was right this time, he didn't deny it.</p><br><p>"First of all, even if I were looking for an Operator right now, I have no use for a woman! We just can't get together, no way!"</p><br><p>'Makes sense...' Adam muttered internally.</p><br><p>"Secondly, those three wimps were only thinking of grabbing her and selling her. Hah, until the very last moment, they didn't even realize that she wasn't just an Operator, but the Operator of the K3-Phantom.</p><br><p>"If they had realized it sooner, they would have run away in fear, but deep down, they would regret that they weren't strong enough to take her away from you. K3 Operator from the Upper Ring? Hah, a deal like that would get them any kind of terms in any organization. It's more than a jackpot!"</p><br><p>Risha waved her hand, preparing to fight, her eyes deepening.</p><br><p>"I'm not interested in this. I don't need her as an Operator for personal use, and I have no incentive in the form of money or connections for selling her - I have this. I came here to fight you - Adam Vinter."</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Risha tore forward, turning into a crimson flash.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, but not because of her speed or strength but because of what she said at the last moment.</p><br><p>'Agh...? I introduced myself and Silvana, but...'</p><br><p>His eyes reflected Risha's silhouette, who was about to bring down on him an axe full of her wild energy.</p><br><p>'I only told her our names. How the fuck does she know my last name?'</p><br><br><p>The crimson blast rained down on Adam, tossing Silvana aside. She didn't often find herself on the battlefield, but something like this couldn't shatter her. She stepped back, energy flowing over her body.</p><br><p>Somehow, using Adam's energy for amplification, she was becoming much stronger than ordinary people.</p><br><p>However... one Risha's boosted energy attack would be enough to cut Silvana in two like she did to the bald man.</p><br><p>"ADAM!" Silvana exclaimed, defending herself against the gusts of wind.</p><br><p>The smoke screen dissipated, revealing two silhouettes.</p><br><p>The broad blade of the axe was half plunged into the ground. Risha's attack landed on Adam's right but failed to hit him.</p><br><p>"What...?" she blinked a few times. "Did I miss?"</p><br><br><p>A cold voice echoed from above.</p><br><p>"You hit, almost. I just evaded. You weren't fast enough.</p><br><br><p>"That's not what's important right now."</p><br><br><p>Before Risha could react, Adam grabbed her by the neck, squeezing with brutal power.</p><br><p>Risha's veins swelled from the pressure, her face immediately reddening with suffocation.</p><br><p>"You..." Adam wheezed, a cold vapor drifting over his shoulders. "Unlike those three idiots, you didn't just hope someone or something interesting would show up at the dump. You knew that a Phantom from the Upper Ring would probably end up here."</p><br><br><p>Adam bent over, his blue eyes growing wider, engulfing the trembling Risha who was trying to loosen his grip.</p><br><p>"You knew it would be me - Adam Vinter, not some random Light Phantom."</p><br><p>Veins ran up his arm, the muscles on his forearm quivering.</p><br><p>"How did you know that little bitch!?"</p><br><p>Risha only muttered something inaudible as she raised her left arm, her eyes glittered.</p><br><p>The silhouette of the beast's paw covered her hand, coming down on Adam in a wide sweep.</p><br><p>In a swift move, Adam shifted backward.</p><br><p>Three sharp claws sliced through the air, slicing through the air right in front of his face. The tips of his hair rippled in the wild currents of wind.</p><br><p>"Bastard... Gha!" Risha coughed, holding onto her throat. "How do you have so much strength in you?"</p><br><p>Simultaneously, they both moved from their spots about to collide in the center. Adam gathered energy around his right arm, intending to defeat Risha with one powerful punch from his Global Gene.</p><br><p>Suddenly, Adam's eyes went wide as he saw something he didn't expect at all.</p><br><p>A star appeared in Risha's right eye - just like the one he and Silvana got while using the Stellar Resonance.</p><br><p>'What...? The Stellar Resonance? How...? How did she and her Operator achieve it considering the way Operators are treated in this perishing place?'</p><br><p>In a broad swing of her axe, Risha tossed Adam aside. A few drops of fresh blood fell on her face, making it more serious than ever - no trace of her playful demeanor remained. Adam's one attack showed her that she could actually die.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..." she breathed heavily, watching Adam pierce the mounds of debris with his back. "Why the fuck is he so strong? I've heard that Phantoms from the Upper Ring are weak! No! I've personally tested a few of them!"</p><br><p>A bright flash of light caused Risha to look away. She gasped, seeing Silvana's left eye glow.</p><br><p>Before Risha could realize what had happened, Adam had already emerged in front of her. Silver threads ran down his body along the swollen veins, while a four-pointed star intersected with the amber grid in his right eye.</p><br><br><p>Adam's hand dropped to Risha's face, holding her above the ground with ease. He ducked slightly before bouncing off the ground, leaving behind a crater-sized dent.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam turned into a white flash sweeping across the junkyard. All Silvana could hear was the rumbling and Risha's rare attempts to fight back.</p><br><p>The ground shook harder with every second, even with shared sight. Silvana couldn't understand what was happening between Adam and Risha.</p><br><br><p>After only one minute, Adam returned to his original position.</p><br><p>The steam was coming out of his body, his hand tightly gripping Risha's hair, dragging her along the ground, under her ragged breathing on the verge of death.</p>
