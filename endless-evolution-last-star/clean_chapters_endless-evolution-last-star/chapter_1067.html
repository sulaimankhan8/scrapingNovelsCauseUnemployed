            <h4>Chapter 1067: Two Barons and the Main Course (Part 2)</h4><br><p>Even if they were Barons, the weakest among the Lords, the lowest of the three stages of the Lesser Lords, they were still extremely strong monsters.
</p><br><p>Almost all Barons, as well as Lords, were monsters of the Hallow Wave time. Just like among the Phantoms, there was a pretty slim chance that someone from the new generation would be able to reach the top.
</p><br><p>They were always running out of time until the inevitable happened.
</p><br><p>The two guards at the dark wall, the female and male demons, had lived for dozens or even hundreds of years, killed thousands of monsters and Phantoms along the way, perhaps many more. They had both gone through countless obstacles on their way to evolve and become stronger.
</p><br><p>And... where did that get them?
</p><br><p>Now, they were on Gladius’s plate, empty, there was nothing but them, for they were the main course.
</p><br><p>All they could accomplish was to satisfy the hunger of the devil, who continued to watch them with a sly smirk.
</p><br><p>"No! Nothing... nothing works!" The woman exclaimed as she watched her flame disappear into the darkness.
</p><br><p>No matter what she tried to do, the energy inside the sphere was consuming all her attempts to get out, to gain freedom and a chance at life.
</p><br><p>"Don’t worry, I’ll get us out of here!" the man wheezed.
</p><br><p>No, he couldn’t. There was no way out for them.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>He gathered all the power of his fire in one point, throwing the orb high up with a powerful flame burst.
</p><br><p>Once the orb would explode, there would be an outbreak of great magnitude. Such a force would be enough to destroy the Fallen Ring Castle, along with Arnoth and Kreyna, with all the Serpents, leaving behind only a crater and charred edges.
</p><br><br><p>The devil opened its mouth, swallowing the flaming orb. He slowly chewed it up before swallowing with a loud gulp.
</p><br><p>"Gha..." He only exhaled the hot steam outward.
</p><br><p>"Oh, right, how could I forget."
</p><br><p>Gladius shook his head, touching his mouth with his fingertips.
</p><br><p>"You need at least some sort of appetizer before the main course. Well, looks like I have to thank you, guards Baron."
</p><br><p>Then, Gladius took a step back, partially merging with the darkness.
</p><br><p>"I’m afraid this dinner won’t last as long as I’d like. You know, I’m in a hurry for a real show, not this..." his eyes fell on the two trembling Lords. "Pathetic starter..."
</p><br><p>Gladius waved his hand as the devil’s hands came into motion. The knife and fork headed towards the guards, slicing them apart with confidence.
</p><br><p>An experienced guest would not hesitate or show uncertainty cutting his far from first steak at his favorite restaurant.
</p><br><p>Maybe he would savor the moment and take it slow, but that would take time that Gladius didn’t have.
</p><br><br><p>A cold torrent of wind blew near Gladius as the purple orb disappeared, as well as the prepared dinner.
</p><br><p>Instead of the guards, the ground was now covered in chunks of flesh, and their torn clothes were soaked in blood.
</p><br><p>’Well, well...’ Xyrea’s voice echoed in Gladius’s mind. ’You really want to make it in time, don’t you? Used such a powerful ability on two Barons... Aren’t you worried that someone more serious would want to stop you?’
</p><br><p>"Nah." He waved his hand loosely with a confident stride, heading towards the dark wall waiting ahead of him. "Don’t try to scare me! I’ll make it quick and beautiful like I always do."
</p><br><p>Xyrea was about to say something when Gladius stopped. Something in his mood silenced her.
</p><br><p>"Hah, after all, I did something similar when I met you. How many monsters do you think were stolen from the Dark Shore to become an Operator? Hahaha! I’ve never seen you as embarrassed as you were then! Fuck yeah! That was fun!"
</p><br><p>There was no response, Xyrea only puffed up her cheeks like a disgruntled schoolgirl. She had nothing to reply on that.
</p><br><p>"Alright, it’s time to break the gate and quickly run to the Sacrificial Waterfalls."
</p><br><p>The gate would recover fairly quickly, even without the presence of guards, as would all the entry points at the Dark Shore.
</p><br><p>For Gladius, a single crack was enough to break through. For him, it was no problem.
</p><br><p>Only time and distance hindered him.
</p><br><br><br><p>Keeping his hands behind his back like a stately nobleman, Saegar slowly descended to where twenty young monsters of the Red Threat Level, Adam, and Valdris, were gathered.
</p><br><p>Saegar wasn’t walking down the stairs or slope but through the air. With every step he took, a short black pulse resounded beneath his feet, creating a solid surface directly beneath him, preventing him from falling.
</p><br><p>After all, unlike the other monsters at the Soaring Chain Islands, he had no wings. Even the maids that served desserts to Kenward, the youngest and weakest monsters in these lands had wings, but not their leader.
</p><br><p>The group was near a rift leading into a deep, dark chasm full of caves, divided into many levels by nature.
</p><br><p>All the monsters stood on the left side, the lone Adam standing on the right, Valdis hovering behind him. His job was to make sure that the wing trial started according to the rules.
</p><br><p>He realized that Saegar wanted to find out who among the younger generation was worthy of strength. When the strongest of the top twenty received the Twilight Crystal, then a new wing warrior would appear in their ranks who would immediately join Valdris’s squad.
</p><br><br><p>Saegar stopped between the gorge, hovering above the void with no wings.
</p><br><p>"I’m sure Valdris has already explained everything to you. Adam said the dark route is headed this way. So somewhere in this gorge is hidden the Twilight Crystal, most likely of medium size. That’s the only thing that makes sense considering the level of our dear guest." He waved a hand in Adam’s direction.
</p><br><p>Then, he chuckled briefly.
</p><br><p>"I hope you realize that once you go down there, your lives are only in your hands. There are twenty of you, Adam is one, but unlike you, he knows where to go to get the Twilight Crystal.
</p><br><br><p>Saegar looked around at the monsters and Adam.
</p><br><p>"Good luck to all of you. Soon... It’ll be a lot safer down there than above."</p>
