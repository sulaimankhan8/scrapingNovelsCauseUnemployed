            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1403: That Very Phantom</strong></p><br><p>Despite the fact that there was a lot of outrage from the audience, deep down, they were glad to be at the Red Eye Arena today.</p><br><p>It wasn’t just that they would see Adam Vinter fight, but that soon there would be no free seats left.</p><br><p>Even influential monsters in the chambers might have to share their seats with someone else. Well, if they were acquaintances or good friends.</p><br><p>The fight between Adam and Beatra had already entered its active phase, but this was only the beginning. Many monsters throughout Izardo received information that Adam Vinter was fighting at the Red Eye Arena.</p><br><p>It was understandable that since there were far fewer powerful Phantoms than powerful monsters, the reaction to them was appropriate.</p><br><p>An ordinary, unknown K4-Phantom would attract much more attention than some Elder that everyone knew at Izardo.</p><br><p>Considering that Adam was not a nameless Phantom, on the contrary, his name had already spread throughout the world among the circles of the Awakened Monsters.</p><br><p>So… while Adam and Beatra exchanged the first blows to understand each other’s strength, all of Izardo was in motion, and the Hybrids were no exception.</p><br><p>Adam and Helasa’s plan worked as intended. All he had to do to succeed was defeat Beatra, and he shouldn’t have had any problems with that.</p><br><br><p>One strike after another, Beatra tried to break through Adam’s defense. However, no matter how hard she tried, he blocked every one of her strikes.</p><br><p>“Damn, if it were anyone else, I would have won by now.” Beatra frowned as she watched Adam’s fluid movements. “Tsk, how about this?!”</p><br><br><p>Beatra spun around sharply as her foot shot toward Adam, cutting through the wind like a blade.</p><br><p>As in all previous instances, Adam raised his hand. A small amount of energy gathered in his palm to block the impending kick.</p><br><p>However, Beatra was not only prepared for him to do so, she was counting on it.</p><br><br><p>The energy burst forth in a powerful stream, making Beatra’s kick much more powerful than expected.</p><br><br><p>With a force comparable to an explosion, all the energy crashed into Adam, as the impact threw him aside.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s back slammed into the edge of the arena as cracks ran across the wall.</p><br><p>“Hell yeah!” someone in the audience exclaimed as new monsters appeared every second, rushing to take their seats. “He’s not as strong as he tries to appear!”</p><br><p>“Go Beatra, a few more accurate hits and he’ll fall!”</p><br><p>“Without his abilities, he’s incapable of anything! No one can match your physical strength, Beatra!”</p><br><p>Despite the overwhelming support from the audience, Beatra didn’t feel like she was any closer to victory.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, dusting himself off.</p><br><p>“Not bad, not bad at all. Tell me, Beatra.” Adam stared at her. ” Would you be stronger with your abilities or weaker?”</p><br><p>It was a strange question, especially at the Red Eye Arena, where using abilities was prohibited by the rules.</p><br><p>However, Beatra had no reason not to answer.</p><br><p>“Of course, with abilities, what a silly question?”</p><br><p>“But, you’re also strong with your bare fists, right?”</p><br><p>Beatra was wary. “Yes, so what? I don’t know what you’re up to, but I often fight in arenas, especially here. The rules are pretty much the same everywhere. In a 1-on-1 battle, the one with superior control over their energy and body will prove themselves best!”</p><br><p>There was no arguing with that, but Adam decided to try.</p><br><p>“Well, what can I say? You’re right about that, but… What will you do if your enemy’s fist is five times heavier than yours?”</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Adam’s fist trembled as she swung her arm back to attack.</p><br><p>The ability was forbidden to use, but he had more than enough energy to create a powerful blow.</p><br><p>Beatra gulped as white flames swirled around Adam’s fist, spinning rapidly like energy around a star that was about to explode at any moment.</p><br><p>The spectators were just as shocked as Beatra. They stared at Adam, who was using more and more power with every heartbeat.</p><br><p>‘Shit, I have to respond to this!’ Beatra exclaimed internally as she began to accumulate energy as well.</p><br><p>But it was already too late.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s frame trembled as he appeared right in front of Beatra in an instant.</p><br><p>Her wide eyes reflected his calm gaze as well as the white, all-consuming flame that was actually just Adam’s energy.</p><br><p>Acting on instinct, Beatra crossed her arms in front of her at the last moment in hopes of blocking the impending attack.</p><br><br><p>With a deafening roar, an explosion rang out as Beatra flew across the arena, unable to stay on her feet.</p><br><p>It was still a physical attack that followed all the rules, but it was clearly not what Beatra was prepared for.</p><br><br><p>She crashed into the wall as blood gushed from her mouth.</p><br><p>A sharp, burning pain ran through her hands, which remained intact and unbroken by some miracle.</p><br><br><p>For a moment, silence hung over the Red Eye Arena as most of the audience stared at Beatra. They hoped she would be able to continue fighting, as many bets depended on it.</p><br><p>“Kha!” Beatra coughed several times, blood spurting onto the ground, but she was not going to give up.</p><br><p>With difficulty, Beatra got to her feet, dark bruises covering her forearms.</p><br><p>“Hmm? You’re still standing? Not bad.” Adam praised her. “Shall we continue, or will you admit defeat?”</p><br><p>Beatra brushed the blood from her mouth as she was about to answer when an arrogant voice rang out from above:</p><br><p>“Enough of this shit!”</p><br><p>Everyone turned to look at the girl with sharp, lightning-blue eyes and hair down to her back. Her large, purple eyes were wide open, full of bloodlust.</p><br><p>No one tried to silence her because everyone immediately understood that she was a Hybrid, one of the few in Izardo and in the whole world.</p><br><p>The girl’s fangs were slightly longer than those of humans, as were her sharp nails, which resembled claws.</p><br><p>However, what truly separated her from monsters and Phantoms was her body, lean and muscular, as if bound by titanium ropes, and her aura, aggressive and active like a wild beast whose purpose in life was to fight.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow as he looked at the unfamiliar girl. Before this, he had only met two Hybrids, Nessa and Mariam. However, they were even rarer Human Hybrids, while now he was facing a Monster Hybrid.</p><br><p>The judge’s voice rang out:</p><br><p>“Erada, even considering your victories and status, you have no right to interfere in the fights of other fighters.”</p><br><p>In response, Erada’s eyes rolled as she waved her hand dismissively.</p><br><p>“Pfffft, calm down, old man, I’m just pointing out the obvious. Even if this bitch has a pretty good win rate, what chance does she have against fucking Adam Vinter?! I want to fight him, right fucking now!”</p><br><p>Still, despite her fiery remarks, Erada didn’t dare to actually break the rules. She didn’t take any of the seats and just stood nearby, because she had just arrived and the first thing she saw was how easily Adam threw Beatra aside.</p><br><p>Spectators continued to arrive, and it was quite possible that Erada would not be the first Hybrid here.</p><br><p>She waited for some kind of reaction from Adam. Erada knew that Adam Vinter, like her, loved to fight. It was a big part of his journey as Phantom, and thanks to that, he became who he is now.</p><br><p>The monsters who knew Adam also knew about his battles on the border between life and death, where he always emerged victorious.</p><br><p>This might have frightened some monsters, but not the Hybrids.</p><br><p>“Come on, Adam Vinter, say something!” Erada demanded, pounding her fist on the railing.</p><br><p>Beatra glanced at Erada and Adam. Strange feelings filled her, as if she had become superfluous in her own battle.</p><br><p>Deep down, she wanted Adam to refuse Erada.</p><br><p>‘Tsk. Someone like him… Of course, he would want to fight the Hybrids. They’re just battle psychos!’ She exclaimed inwardly.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped aside as he stared at Erada.</p><br><p>“What answer do you expect from me? All these monsters…” He waved his hand toward the audience. “They’ve placed their bets and are waiting to see the outcome of the battle. Do you think that just because you came here, I’m going to abandon my fight?”</p><br><p>Erada’s face froze. This was not the reaction she had hoped for.</p><br><p>“Pffft.” Adam waved his hand dismissively at her as if trying to get rid of an annoying fly. “Don’t act like a child.”</p><br><br><p>The stone railing cracked under Erada’s grip as her claws dug deep into it. She would have accepted any outcome in which Adam attacked her, marking her as a worthy opponent, but not this!</p><br><p>Still, what options did Erada have other than to continue watching?</p><br><p>“Hey!” Adam addressed Beatra. “Are you going to stand there forever? Our fight must continue!”</p><br><p>Beatra flinched at his beaming expression as she gulped.</p><br><p>“S-Sure. I’ll show you that defeating me won’t be easy!”</p><br><p>“Great,” Adam smirked. “The longer we fight, the better!”</p>
