            <br><p>In a quiet room lit by dim lights, Vorx nodded deeply and headed for the exit.</p><br><p>"Alright. Since we're all sorted out, I'm heading back. I'll tell Arnoth and that bitch Kreyna that I couldn't find a suitable Phantom this time."</p><br><p>Then, Vorx left, heading towards the castle.</p><br><p>Adam was left alone with Torz, Grita, and Heret. Risha was here too, but she sat to the side of the table - all attention was directed at Adam.</p><br><p>"Well... Vorx surprised me as always," Heret grunted, sitting at the head of the table across from Adam. "So you're the one who robbed my friend of his right eye, aren't you?"</p><br><p>Unconcerned about anything, Adam nodded weakly.</p><br><p>Heret folded his hands together, pondering something with a deep look in his eyes.</p><br><p>"He asked me to give you a chance, but I don't trust you. You are a Phantom - you are our natural enemies. It's not normal for us to be allies."</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand nonchalantly. "You just need to think about it from the other side. We don't need to become best friends, we just have the same enemy and a common goal.</p><br><p>"I don't mean to give ultimatums, but you need me more than I need you. I think you understand that perfectly well."</p><br><p>Torz, standing behind Heret, frowned heavily.</p><br><p>"What?" he gritted his teeth in a grimace. "Even if you're strong enough to wound Vorx, that doesn't mean you can disrespect us! We can finish you off right now!"</p><br><br><p>Adam's cold voice boomed out.</p><br><p>"But before we start the battle, I want you to get something straight."</p><br><br><p>"I didn't just wound Vorx. I practically killed him, and I was willing to do it. If he hadn't told me about your situation, things wouldn't have made it this far. Vorx thinks that if I can get stronger, I can defeat Arnoth."</p><br><p>"That's nonsense...!" Torz exclaimed.</p><br><br><p>Heret slammed the table.</p><br><p>"We're not here to argue. I believe Vorx, and that is why you are still alive, Adam and Risha. I just want to know your intentions."</p><br><p>Then, Heret leaned forward, staring intently at Adam.</p><br><p>"What will you do in the face of death? Will you run away, or will you fight to the end?"</p><br><p>"Pffft," Adam snorted mockingly. "If I end up so weak that I have to run from Arnoth, what's the point? He's sure to catch up with me and kill me. But, if we're evenly matched and I have a one in a hundred chance of winning. I won't miss that opportunity."</p><br><p>Before Heret could say anything, Adam rose from his seat, looking up at the three serpents from above.</p><br><p>"I'm not doing this because I want to save you and your folk or avenge your king and queen. I fight to become stronger, I put my goals before your desires. If you are not satisfied with that, then I can leave right now."</p><br><p>Grita chuckled softly as Torz turned around, gritting his teeth.</p><br><p>"Hah... You humans... Always thinking only of yourself," Heret smiled bitterly while flames flared in his previously empty eyes. "Good. I don't need a hero who speaks of goodness and justice. I need a warrior who will come and do the job."</p><br><p>The conversation was coming to an end. Risha could feel it.</p><br><p>She didn't want to be left out again.</p><br><p>"Ehm... What about me? Vorx said that we can defeat Kreyna together!"</p><br><p>Heret spread his arms out to the sides.</p><br><p>"Don't worry, we'll soon see what you're capable of, both of you. We have two or three weeks. In that time, you should become much stronger. Then, we'll have enough powerful fighters to overwhelm Arnoth and Kreyna."</p><br><p>As Vorx headed for the castle, walking down the main street, Adam, Heret, and the others went further into the caves.</p><br><p>'You don't know where we're going, right?' Adam asked Silvana, following Heret down the practically dark passageway for several minutes now.</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head. 'Unfortunately, no, but I think you're going to a safe place as far away from the castle as possible. You and Risha should be going through training, possibly fighting. Either way, there will be bursts of energy, and your auras will become unstable.'</p><br><p>'I see...' he nodded deeply in understanding. 'That makes sense. Even if it weren't for Risha and me, the rebels should have a place to practice.'</p><br><br><p>After a hundred steps, Heret stopped - they reached a dead end.</p><br><p>However, neither Torz nor Grita seemed confused. They just frowned, about to do something they weren't comfortable with.</p><br><p>Without saying anything, they dropped to one knee, Heret in turn bowing low with his palm to his chest.</p><br><p>Adam and Risha exchanged a look, puzzled.</p><br><p>'Vorx didn't warn you about anything like this...'</p><br><p>"Oh, Radiant Mirage, please allow us to enter your domain," Heret proclaimed with a voice full of respect.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The wall shuddered as two crystal hands appeared outside, the silhouette of a knight in shining armor and a mirror instead of a head.</p><br><p>'Unknown monster again?' Adam asked as he raised an eyebrow in surprise.</p><br><p>Silvana flinched, feeling a strange shiver at the sight of the crystal knight. For some reason, her Operator instincts acted differently than when she saw a monster or Phantom.</p><br><p>Then, a mouth reflected in the mirror, letting out a strange vibration.</p><br><p>"Heret... How dare you bring two Phantoms here...? Get rid of them immediately, or you can forget about my help..."</p><br><p>"No, you've got it all wrong! These two... They're Phantoms, but they're here to help us! We just need time! They need to get stronger just like us!" Heret tried to explain himself to the strange creature.</p><br><p>The knight waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Silence...! Kill the Phantoms, now!"</p><br><p>Risha prepared to fight, but Adam had already sprung into action. However, he wasn't going to fight - he realized what was behind the mirror knight.</p><br><p>'Go ahead, just touch it, I'll do all the work from here,' Lone Blaze smirked, she had been in contact with Adam for some time now.</p><br><br><p>Adam grabbed the knight's hand, then his eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>The next moment, he found himself in an unknown space made up of countless mirrors.</p>
