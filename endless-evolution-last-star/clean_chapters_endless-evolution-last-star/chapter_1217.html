            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1217: Lightning Threat (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Strangely enough, but for most of his journey, Phantom had no opportunity to feel what the monsters were capable of when they worked together.</p><br><p>This wasn’t about a colony of monsters like the Kirani Bugs, or some large, protected Nest or Stronghold, but about the Dark Shore and the Befallen Crown in particular.</p><br><p>It was a system in which weaker monsters, compared to the Lords, could get support or even borrow power from another monster.</p><br><p>For this to happen, several conditions had to be met, sometimes very strict and difficult. However, if a monster needed it, it found a way to make it happen.</p><br><p>Bathild was one such example.</p><br><p>Monsters from the Tarnished Lands found it more difficult to get help from the Dark Shore, but for someone like Bathild, who ruled over a territory close to the Dark Shore, it was an easy task.</p><br><p>Her pride prevented her from resorting to the Exarch’s help, but she had no other choice.</p><br><p>She had overestimated herself. She didn’t understand that Adam was stronger not because he had more experience in battle, but because his body was stronger, or his genes were simply better.</p><br><p>No, it wasn’t even his energy or abilities, although all of those things had an impact on the battlefield.</p><br><p>What Bathild hadn’t seen before were the monsters, the defeated enemies standing behind Adam, which had become an important part of his path.</p><br><p>Even decades of training wouldn’t have allowed him to acquire the skills he had gained in battle against the Crimson Monarch of the Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>It was something he could only gain through battle, and in this case, quality mattered more than quantity.</p><br><p>Bathild didn’t have enough of those battles. Moreover, if she defeated Adam, he would be the first opponent who was so difficult for her.</p><br><p>And… At that moment, she had a much better chance of doing that than Adam had of staying alive.</p><br><p>Clash. Clash. Clash.</p><br><p>Clash after clash, cascades of sparks flew to the sides, rushing past Bathild’s trembling eyes.</p><br><p>After she got her burst of strength, she no longer looked like a calm, collected warrior.</p><br><p>No, she was more like a wild beast who desperately wanted to complete her mission and knew that now was her chance.</p><br><p>Adam remained calm, but that was hardly possible in his situation.</p><br><p>‘Shit! Shit! Shit! She’s too fast!’ Adam exclaimed inwardly when Bathild’s hand trembled.</p><br><p>Then, a cascade of four attacks rained down on him, with minimal delay between them. It seemed to Adam that he was being attacked from different sides at the same time, even though there was only one opponent in front of him.</p><br><p>“How long are you going to stare at me like that?!” Bathild growled. “You’re no match for me anymore! You can’t beat me! Not anymore!”</p><br><p>At the next clash of sword and needle, Bathild threw Adam aside.</p><br><p>He didn’t have time to land before Bathild aimed her sword at him, making him the target of something looming overhead.</p><br><p>THUNDER! THUNDER! THUNDER!</p><br><p>Cracks of thunder came out of nowhere as dark clouds blocked out the light from the myriad stars filling the sky.</p><br><p>Adam raised his head as his eyes widened.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, the thunder strike crashed down on Adam, bringing its terrifying power.</p><br><p>A tremor ran through the ground as electrical discharges struck the surface, causing new cracks to form.</p><br><p>Bathild’s eyes narrowed as she noticed a splash of blood gushing from the epicenter of the strike. The corners of her lips curved into a satisfied smirk.</p><br><p>She had finally managed to wound Adam, and it was definitely not something simple.</p><br><p>More than a minute had passed since Adam and Bathild began fighting, but… Bathild still didn’t know that Marhen had come to her aid.</p><br><br><p>Because in more than a minute, he hadn’t made it to the surface.</p><br><br><br><p>At the same time, Fromund was trying to resist the attacks of the two princes. The Silver Prince and the Amber Prince used their swords and spears to overwhelm Fromund, as well as the energy fields hidden within their powerful bodies.</p><br><p>Moroya preferred to fight at medium or long range. She saw no point in getting too close to Fromund, especially when the two princes had already done so.</p><br><br><p>With a wave of her hand, several amber orbs appeared around Moroya as the rays headed straight for Fromund.</p><br><p>The two princes, working as a well-coordinated team, simultaneously jumped to the sides to avoid Moroya’s attack.</p><br><p>‘Fuck! They’re too fast!’ Fromund exclaimed inwardly as he managed to jump aside at the last moment.</p><br><p>The rays flew over his shoulder, leaving a shallow cut, but even his flame cloths couldn’t protect him.</p><br><p>If Moroya had hit him directly, he would have suffered critical injuries or died if his head or heart had been the target.</p><br><p>“I have to kill one of them, but…”</p><br><p>Before Fromund could finish his thought, the Silver Prince’s knee slammed into his face.</p><br><p>Then, the Amber Prince surged forward, plunging his spear straight into Fromund’s leg.</p><br><p>“ARGH!” Fromund cried out in pain as a hammer appeared in a blaze ring.</p><br><br><p>He slammed his foot into the ground, causing a tremor comparable to an earthquake that forced the two princes to retreat for a moment.</p><br><p>But this brief pause only showed that Fromund had little chance of victory, with every second, his situation was getting worse.</p><br><p>“Fromund, maybe it’s time to use it…?” Arayna asked, her voice calm despite the situation.</p><br><br><p>The two princes exchanged glances as they lunged forward in unison, intending to pin Fromund against the wall.</p><br><p>Strangely, Fromund shook his head.</p><br><p>“Nah, maybe later, but right now I want to try something else. They didn’t even notice that I’ve been waiting patiently all this time. And I don’t like waiting!”</p><br><p>With a wide swing of his arm, Fromund pushed away the Amber Prince, who was afraid of getting hurt, but the Silver Prince continued his advance.</p><br><p>He swung his sword when Fromund took a step back. The blade whizzed past his eyes, leaving a long cut on his cheek.</p><br><p>The Silver Prince was about to continue his series of attacks, but something held him back—fear chained his body.</p><br><p>Three rings hovered around his spear, as Fromund’s grin widened, becoming insidious.</p><br><p>“Alright, let’s see how you can take this, you bastard.”</p><br><p>Then, flames covered Fromund’s spear, gathering great heat at the tip that was as scorching and destructive as the rays of the cruel sun.</p>
