            <br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>With a thud, Silvana, Abel, and Talna landed near the entrance to the Obsidian Spatial Caves. They realized that the monsters were already waiting for them and could hide behind crystals or stone peaks, but first, they had to prepare for battle.</p><br><p>The first was Abel, who threw off his heavy case.</p><br><br><p>The top lid opened, revealing a simple-looking weapon with nothing extra.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide for a moment as if she was seeing something familiar again, though this was the first time she'd seen Abel's Nexus.</p><br><p>A massive steel hammer with a huge head lay in the middle of the case, golden lines, running along the cold hilt reaching the top, forming a nine-pointed star on the side of the head.</p><br><p>'A hammer...' Silvana internally muttered, 'Didn't I see another Phantom with a hammer recently? How strange...'</p><br><p>She shook her head sharply.</p><br><p>'Enough! I shouldn't be thinking about that right now. I'm on a dangerous mission. It was probably just some video!' Enjoy exclusive chapters from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><br><p>Abel raised his hammer slung on his shoulder with a wide grin on his face.</p><br><p>"Damn, even though it's my weapon, it's so heavy. Well, good thing it's doing its job just fine."</p><br><p>Then, Abel turned to Talna, who was looking boredly towards the cave entrance, at the violet eyes peering out of the void.</p><br><p>"What about you? Looks like your Nexus is quite small since you didn't bring a case with you."</p><br><p>"You're right..." Talna said in a low tone before slipping her hand under her black robe.</p><br><p>Her hand returned with a dark flat book that was a custom-made case. As soon as Talna opened the book, Silvana and Abel saw lurking inside a silver cross with spiky edges on a short chain.</p><br><p>With a deft movement, Talna slipped her small hand through the chain, putting the silver cross on like a bracelet.</p><br><p>"I'm ready. The sooner we finish this mission, the sooner we can get home." Talna said, popping another piece of gum into her mouth.</p><br><p>Then, with a serene face, she glanced at Silvana.</p><br><p>"Why are you making us wait? Pull out your Nexus, and let's go into battle. I'm sure even the monsters are tired of waiting for you to be ready by now."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyebrow twitched a few times, Talna was starting to get on her nerves again, but she couldn't admit that Talna was right.</p><br><p>"Fine, after all, we came here to fight and kill monsters as side goals of our mission."</p><br><p>With a wave of her hand, Silvana opened her case, and the corners of her lips went up, forming a satisfied smirk.</p><br><p>Black as the abyss itself the scissors reflected in her eyes. Two long blades sharp on only one side were joined, the two handles were round and wide allowing her to grasp them by any part. Other than their size, these scissors were almost nothing different from normal scissors.</p><br><br><p>Silvana raised her weapon before grinning widely and pulling the scissors apart, turning them into two long swords.</p><br><p>"Agh, I've done this hundreds of times before, but each time feels as good as the first!" Silvana exclaimed with an excited expression.</p><br><p>Talna ran her gaze over Silvana's Nexus, seeing her reflection in the two black, straight blades wide enough to leave a deep cut even on the monster's very thick hide.</p><br><p>"Hey, I think we're in the wrong order." Talna waved her hand.</p><br><p>Abel and Silvana glanced over since Talna was right. The monsters were in front, with Abel standing behind everyone, while Talna was closest to the entrance which was dangerous for her and their group.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you're right. Though, no opponents have shown up yet, so that shouldn't be a problem." Abel awkwardly scratched the back of his head before heading forward.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a shadow swept behind the stone peak next to where Talna stood.</p><br><p>Long, sharp claws showed out of the darkness as a lean, curvy body emerged from behind the peak, reaching out its scaly paws toward Talna.</p><br><p>Abel's Operator's excited voice echoed in their ears:</p><br><br><p>They were on a joint mission and there were only three of them, so the Operators could speak to just their Phantom as well as into the general channel so everyone else could hear them.</p><br><p>However... Talna didn't even bother to turn around, though an experienced Phantom like her noticed the monster's movements.</p><br><br><p>A steel hammer swept over her head at high speed, wind currents whistling at her ears fluttering her crimson hair.</p><br><p>The massive head smashed into her chest covered in protective scales, shattering the tough layer into shards.</p><br><p>"RRRRRGGHHHHHHHHH!!!"</p><br><p>With a painful hiss, the long shadow slammed into the stone peak, breaking it in half. The top fell to the ground with a clatter, raising black dust upwards.</p><br><p>"Here comes the first one."</p><br><p>Talna slowly turned around, looking at the monster that was trying to recover from Abel's powerful blow. If his hammer had hit the monster's head, the fight would be over by now.</p><br><p>Watching their actions from afar, Adam muttered:</p><br><p>'Not a bad strike, too bad Abel's goal was to protect Talna and not kill the enemy, otherwise, you would not need to continue.'</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes closely examining the monster.</p><br><p>It was an anthropomorphic lizard, with a lean body covered in black scales and long multi-jointed limbs. The long claws on its paws and legs were its main weapons, but its thick, straight tongue with a sharp tip was capable of piercing its target like a harpoon and inflicting serious internal damage.</p><br><p>A long webbed ridge ran down its back to a broad tail, suitable for heavy blows rather than quick cuts.</p><br><p>The monster's head was elongated, with two violet eyes, vertical pupils, and an extended jaw suitable for digging hard into enemy flesh.</p><br><p>'Well...' Adam muttered, 'As you may have already realized, it's an Obsidian Lizard. Not the strongest of opponents, but the most numerous in this region. Be prepared, there will be many more of them in the caves.'</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply, maintaining a serious demeanor.</p><br><br><p>The Obsidian Lizard stepped back from the impact, rising abruptly from the rubble, only to see a shadow bearing towards it.</p><br><p>The heavy hammer came straight down on the monster's head, shattering its skull into pieces, no scales could protect it from such an impact.</p><br><br><br><p>Her gaze traveled to the entrance to the caves.</p><br><p>"That was only their greeting. We have a real feast ahead of us."</p>
