            <br><p>Gladius's serious face gradually changed to his usual light smile. Mariel, Zarot, and the rest of the Phantoms were trying to recover from the attack of his aura, as well as the guests from the scene they saw.</p><br><p>Well, Gladius's didn't attack for real, or else some Phantoms would die due to the monstrous difference in their powers. His aura only worked as a deterrent, like a fetter, and it was enough for the Phantoms to reach their limit.</p><br><p>"Kha... Kha... Kha..." Zarot coughed a few times, taking deep breaths and calming his mind.</p><br><p>'Hmm, maybe I went a bit overboard? It's been a while since I did that, not that I care about their fates though.' Gladius inwardly shrugged with a nonchalant expression on his face.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Gladius felt a shiver go through his body, short and quick. It didn't come from fear, as his body was telling him that something worthy of his attention had happened.</p><br><p>Turning his head and glancing back over his shoulder, Gladius's eyes grew wider for a moment and the corners of his mouth curved up.</p><br><br><p>Adam stared ahead with a deep gaze and a distinct excited smile. His fingertips trembled slightly with anticipation, his mind still trying to deal with the emotions rushing over him. Stay connected via My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>'Instead of trembling with fear, he looks like he wants to see it again. Hah, Aiden was right, back that day he spent most of his luck to make this young demon grow out of a slum boy...'</p><br><br><p>Mariel's fist crashed to the floor, causing the white stone to crack. She raised her head, her face contorted in anger and rage, deep inside she was scared, but she realized that this was her daughter's wedding, that this was her palace!</p><br><br><p>Mariel growled through her teeth, staring at Gladius, whose posture was relaxed, his shoulders were soft and his hands were in his pockets.</p><br><p>"Gladius... what are you doing here?" Mariel stood up, clenching her fists tightly.</p><br><p>Zarot and the rest of the Phantoms followed her example. They were no longer going to attack Adam since they realized that against Gladius they didn't stand a chance. Even if they attacked him at once and used their most powerful abilities, it wouldn't make any difference.</p><br><p>Gladius only needed to release more of his aura with more pressure for their hearts to explode and their minds to become empty.</p><br><p>However, if they weren't going to fight then the situation was different. This was a wedding between the highest nobles and no one had the right to interfere with that, much less start a fight.</p><br><p>"Hah, what am I doing here? It's not a big deal."</p><br><p>Gladius spread his hands apart with a sly grin.</p><br><p>"I didn't get an invitation, and I'm not one of the Twelve Branches, but I wanted to see the wedding, so I got a job here as a waiter and did my work."</p><br><p>At that moment, Gladius turned to the man he was sitting at the same table with.</p><br><p>"Isn't that right?" Gladius's voice became as sly as a serpent's.</p><br><p>The man nodded quickly, not daring to say anything.</p><br><p>Mariel frowned. She realized that this was all complete bullshit, as someone of Gladius's level didn't need to resort to such measures to be at the wedding.</p><br><p>"You expect me to believe that?" Mariel narrowed her eyes, clenching her fists tighter, "If you really wanted to attend my daughter's wedding, I would find the best seats for you."</p><br><p>Gladius shrugged with a silly smile as if he hadn't thought of that.</p><br><p>"Well, I don't like to draw attention and give others a hard time. I even put on a disguise for that and everything was going fine until you decided to try and break one of the oldest laws."</p><br><p>Mariel gulped, Gladius was right, they were not allowed to attack Adam after what he said about The Rule of Power.</p><br><br><p>Zarot stepped forward with a wave of his hand.</p><br><p>"What kind of nonsense is this!? Even if that youngster came here and stated about The Rule of Power, we don't know the bride's opinion. I am well aware of our traditions and ancient laws!"</p><br><p>Zarot said menacingly before continuing. Now they had no threat that Gladius would simply kill them, as their conflict had moved from the practical to the theoretical plan, almost to a bureaucracy where the right words and terms mattered.</p><br><p>"It's a wedding, and whoever uses The Rule of Power immediately involves the other person, in this case the bride, before the fight even begins. Thus, for The Rule of Power to work in this case, the intentions of both participants must be clear and precise."</p><br><p>Zarot's voice echoed throughout the banquet hall, he sounded confident and clear. Though he wasn't prepared for Adam and even less for Gladius to show up today, Zarot was experienced enough to know what to say in such a situation.</p><br><p>Silence fell for a while. Many of the guests looked at each other, they were not so familiar with the details of The Rule of Power so they waited to see what Gladius would say.</p><br><br><p>Slowly, Gladius began to clap his hands, he looked like an onlooker showing applause to an actor who managed to impress him.</p><br><p>"Excellent knowledge Mr. Zarot, though that's not surprising considering how much experience you have with weddings."</p><br><p>Gladius smirked before casting a glance at Nelya who stood in the distance watching the proceedings like everyone else.</p><br><p>"At least you have your failures too, haven't you?" Gladius said slyly, a dangerous gleam running through his eyes.</p><br><p>"Pffft, say what you want, but you know I'm right." Zarot snorted as he crossed his arms over his chest.</p><br><br><p>Gladius nodded deeply before reaching forward towards the golden archway. His gaze showed that he knew what he was doing, perhaps this was a part of his plan long ago or was it his fleeting desire?</p><br><p>"In that case, let's find out what the bride thinks about it."</p><br><p>All eyes headed in the same direction.</p><br><p>Gladius exclaimed in a fiery voice:</p><br><p>"Osana De Rouzet, you have the floor!"</p>
