            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1209: White Blast (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>While events on the lower level gradually picked up speed, two fighters above were battling at the peak of their abilities.</p><br><p>Bathild and Adam clashed with each other, bouncing from one meteor to another, all because of Fromund’s stupid mistake.</p><br><p>Sometimes, one person’s mistake could lead to big changes for others. This was one of those cases.</p><br><p>“Tsk, I need to think of something fast,” Bathild thought before jumping away from the meteor, straight toward Adam.</p><br><p>The force of her legs was enough to break the meteor into pieces, but Adam was just as fast and strong as her.</p><br><p>At first, Bathild thought it was fortunate that Fromund had sent the meteors to their battlefield.</p><br><p>However, she quickly realized that this was not the case. The meteors did not hinder Adam or help Bathild, but the same could not be said for the storm, of which only a small part remained.</p><br><p>Sure, if Bathild managed to lure Adam closer to the edge of their arena, where the storm remained, she would return to her peak strength, but that was not the case.</p><br><p>The sky above them was empty, only a multitude of stars watched their battle, and Bathild felt that even they did not believe in her victory.</p><br><p>‘That bastard. Damn, I knew that if a K4-Phantom became known among monsters, it couldn’t be someone simple, but I didn’t think it would be this difficult!</p><br><p>She raised her hands, bringing her fangs down on Adam, but at the last moment, he jumped aside.</p><br><p>Six blue lines cut through the meteor as Adam landed on the neighboring one.</p><br><p>In fact, he no longer tried to block her attacks. There were no needles or rods in his hands.</p><br><p>Adam didn’t usually do that; he always tried to overwhelm his enemy with brute force and set the pace of the fight, but he made an exception for Bathild.</p><br><br><p>Because he wasn’t interested in fighting, and she couldn’t change that. He saw the path to victory, and Fromund’s mistake helped him.</p><br><p>“She can’t do anything. I almost feel sorry for her,” Adam muttered to himself as he stood on the meteor. “Once her energy from the storm is gone, she’ll be weaker than she was before.”</p><br><p>“You shouldn’t relax too soon, Adam.”</p><br><p>He nodded, sensing the seriousness in Silvana’s tone.</p><br><p>“You’re worried about the tattoo on her chest, right?”</p><br><p>“Yes. She’s not the only monster with tattoos. They always give them power, but I haven’t found a monster with the same tattoo. I don’t know what power she’ll get and what the price will be.”</p><br><p>Bathild’s tattoo could have many purposes. It could be a powerful ability that she could only use once, a combat mode, or something that would put her life at risk for victory.</p><br><br><p>Bathild jumped toward him, the meteor shattering behind her, but by the time she reached her target, Adam was already out of reach.</p><br><p>Soon, the meteors would reach the ground, and Bathild would have to make an important decision.</p><br><p>What’s more, she couldn’t forget that Adam hadn’t used his most powerful ability yet.</p><br><br><br><p>One figure after another, like a hail of blades, descended on Fromund. He swung his spear and blocked the attacks with his free hand, but he couldn’t withstand the onslaught.</p><br><p>The biggest problem was Marhen, who occasionally threw his lightning spears—Fromund had been burned on his shoulder after the last such attack.</p><br><br><p>At Marhen’s shout, the thunder monsters jumped aside to avoid his attack.</p><br><p>Fromund’s eyes widened when a blue spear headed toward him.</p><br><br><p>He snapped his fingers, summoning a stream of fire in front of him, but it wasn’t enough. Marhen’s spear easily broke through the barrier, colliding with Fromund’s.</p><br><br><p>The explosion of blue fire and electric discharges threw Fromund to the ground. His back broke several spines before he came to rest in the depths of the cave.</p><br><p>“Everyone! Attack one target!” Marhen waved his hand as he began preparing his next attack.</p><br><p>Dozens of projectiles, mostly lightning bolts, headed for a single point, while a turquoise orb, almost white from the lightning raging inside it, gathered between Marhen’s palms.</p><br><p>He narrowed his eyes, sensing that Fromund was no longer where his subordinates were attacking him. He was not surprised; he knew that Fromund would quickly change position—the elaborate caves were an excellent place for that.</p><br><p>However, Marhen prepared for battle.</p><br><p>Electric discharges crackled on every rock at the Kirani Colony, each carrying a tiny fragment of Marhen’s energy.</p><br><p>For this reason, he could see where Fromund was and feel his every move.</p><br><p>“I may not be your match in strength, Fromund Aegler, but I have my ways of winning.”</p><br><p>Then, he opened his palm as a white orb turned into a thin projectile resembling a quivering needle.</p><br><br><p>His finger twitched as the needle whistled out of his palm, easily piercing dozens of meters of rock and several caves behind which Fromund was hiding.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><br><p>Hearing the crackling sound, Fromund turned around.</p><br><p>The white needle was reflected in his wide-open eyes. Realizing how much energy was contained in this small object, fear appeared in his eyes.</p><br><br><p>With a bright flash that even Bathild and Adam saw through the entrance to the Kirani Colony, there was a deafening explosion.</p><br><p>Several levels of caves collapsed under their own weight due to a lack of support, and everything between Marhen and Fromund was destroyed.</p><br><p>All that remained was a crater and a smoke screen. As soon as it disappeared, all the monsters would see the state Fromund was in.</p><br><p>“Damn! Did you see that?!” One of them exclaimed with a joyful gleam in his eyes.</p><br><p>“Hell yeah! Our commander is the best!”</p><br><p>“Hah, I think I can see his blood! He must be wounded, it was a direct hit!”</p><br><p>Marhen was in no hurry to rejoice; he was skeptical, although he was more confident than the others that his attack had hit its target.</p><br><p>When the smoke cleared, everyone saw Fromund’s frame. He was lying against the wall, his right shoulder covered in blood from a torn wound.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Marhen realized that this couldn’t be all. His attack had been much more powerful, and he soon found the reason why.</p><br><p>Dark rocks and debris surrounded Fromund like a protective barrier.</p><br><p>Fromund spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><br><p>“Fine, you were right. Thanks for saving my ass.” Fromund said carelessly, turning to Arayna.</p><br><p>Then, he looked at Marhen as two fiery rings lit up in his eyes.</p><br><p>“Looks like I’m going to have to fight you seriously, or I might die.”</p>
