            <br><p>The tension was palpable between Osana and Reinal, a mere human would have quickly broken under his cold, intense gaze, but Osana remained calm.</p><br><p>"What are you talking about? I think a misunderstanding came out. I'm just preparing for my wedding, which will take place in the next few hours." Osana calmly replied keeping her hands folded at the beginning of her dress.</p><br><p>Reinal was not satisfied with this answer. His aura grew stronger as his eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>"Hey, stop pretending you want to do this. I just want to have a serious talk with you."</p><br><p>In response, Osana only snorted, taking a short step forward, Reinal was to her left.</p><br><p>"You all sold me to Nirosh Marzo for the sake of benefits for the family. And what do you want to hear from me? You agreed with the family's decision, you didn't stand up for me, so I have nothing to talk to you about."</p><br><p>Reinal frowned before waving his hand wide in an annoyed manner.</p><br><p>"It's your duty as a high noble. You knew this would happen at some point, as we all do. Sooner or later, every noble goes through it."</p><br><p>Osana slowly turned around, staring at Reinal with a menacing gaze.</p><br><p>"Yes, I knew running away forever wouldn't work, but my situation is different from yours. You're not just a Light Noble, you're a Natural Phantom."</p><br><p>Reinal's facial expression remained the same. All the nobles in the family knew each other's origins. After all, it established their initial status, which couldn't be changed by achievements or effort.</p><br><p>No matter how hard a Hallow Noble tried for the good of his family, his status would always be lower than a Light Noble, and he could never become the head of the family. The differences were clear in the Twelve Branches.</p><br><p>Osana's lips came into motion:</p><br><p>"It won't happen to you that some girl sees your pretty face and wants to take you in forever. It's just not possible because of your status."</p><br><p>Reinal frowned, but he didn't bother to answer anything. He understood what Osana was talking about. If he were an Artificial Phantom, nothing would secure him against a Natural Phantom woman from some great family wanting to marry him. At least until Reinal was married to someone.</p><br><p>"Sister, you were just unlucky. Moreover, if you weren't a rebel and didn't spend so much time in the Dead Lands, this wouldn't happen. For a few years, you could choose your groom and none of this would ever happen!" Reinal exclaimed.</p><br><p>Osana raised an eyebrow. Reinal's words made sense and she couldn't force him to go against the entire family for her sake. Reinal was not that influential and powerful.</p><br><p>"Even if you are unable to change the family's decision, your protest would at least support me morally. That would be a million times more than what you've done."</p><br><p>Reinal clenched his fists tightly, gritting his teeth. It made him angry because all of this might be avoided if Osana behaved like her siblings.</p><br><p>In the end, Osana turned around and muttered:</p><br><p>"Well, I don't blame you. You're just following the will of the family for our common good like everyone else. You're certainly not like him..."</p><br><p>From Osana's last words, Reinal was dumbfounded for a while. Only when Osana went far ahead did he come to his senses.</p><br><p>"Fuck it! Osana, I'll be watching you, I know you're up to something, or else you're not Osana De Rouzet."</p><br><p>Reinal stepped forward with a sweep of his arm, shouting his speech loudly.</p><br><p>"No matter what you're trying to pull, I'll prevent it and stop you, for your own good!"</p><br><p>In response, Osana only disappeared into the shadows, not intending to continue this pointless conversation any further.</p><br><br><br><p>Gladius stepped forward confidently, followed timidly by Silvana, who despite her uncertainty about their scheme tried to do her best to look natural.</p><br><p>A smile shone on Gladius's face, his back straightened, his chest thrust forward and his chin lifted high.</p><br><p>Gladius advanced into the passage, followed by Silvana, but no sooner had she taken a few steps than she stopped and her eyes went wide.</p><br><p>Read new chapters at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>The banquet hall was bigger than she could have imagined even in her wildest dreams. Compared to this, the banquet hall after the theater was tiny, like a barn to a castle.</p><br><p>The first guests began to arrive, making small talk while passing by tables with only a fraction of what the chefs prepared for the evening.</p><br><p>The white stone floor was covered with wide red carpets with delicate patterns to avoid drawing too much attention.</p><br><p>Dozens of massive round white wood tables spread throughout the hall, each table bearing signs and numbers so that guests could quickly find their seats. Well, some tables didn't have any markings, as everyone realized that some of the guests would come without an invitation...</p><br><p>Each table had four to eight high chairs with beige leather upholstery and wide velvet-covered arms.</p><br><p>Eight massive chandeliers illuminated the banquet hall, going in a circle, leaving space in the center for the last one - the ninth, largest chandelier. Its crystals reflecting the light swayed slightly from side to side, only a few meters short of the ground.</p><br><p>Despite the abundance of tables, there was nothing in the middle but a wide path covered in white cloth leading to the very end of the banquet hall.</p><br><p>There was a spacious area reserved only for the bride and groom, prepared for the end of the wedding ceremony.</p><br><p>In the center of the platform was a massive golden arch of intertwining rods creating the effect of an endless stream.</p><br><p>At the very top of the banquet hall, on the far wall hung two black flags, but they were completely different from each other.</p><br><p>The left flag had three pink rose petals coming from the center upwards - the emblem of the Rouzet Family.</p><br><p>On the right flag were two lunar crescents with tips contacting each other, leaving a void inside - the emblem of the Marzo Family.</p><br><br><p>Someone poked Silvana in the shoulder. Turning around, she saw a displeased girl, she was the third waiter in line.</p><br><p>"Why did you stop? Go after the first one like the headwaiter told us to." The girl frowned. She didn't want to be penalized because of another waiter's actions.</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, as she glanced forward, seeing that Gladius had already gone quite far away.</p><br><p>"Y-Yes! Sure! I'm sorry!"</p><br><p>Silvana said guiltily before quickly walking ahead, trying to catch up with Gladius. She was lucky there were no glasses or other drinks on the tray, otherwise it would all fall to the ground due to her haste.</p><br><p>"Pffft. Did she come from a village? Maybe even from the Third Ring?" The girl, the third waiter, snorted, stepping forward confidently.</p><br><p>"Hehehe, it looks like it. Her eyes were so wide open, I guess she'd never seen such luxury before." The girl with blonde hair, the fourth waiter, agreed with a sly laugh.</p><br><p>Then, the girl with black hair, the third waiter, glanced at Gladius.</p><br><p>"I don't know where he came from, but he's handsome, right?"</p><br><p>"Yeah. I agree." The fourth waiter bit her lip predatorily.</p><br><p>Gladius was far ahead, but he heard everything clearly, maintaining his benevolent smile.</p><br><p>'Tsk. Stupid pigs who haven't seen even the slightest bit of the real world dare call someone ignorant. How ironic.'</p>
