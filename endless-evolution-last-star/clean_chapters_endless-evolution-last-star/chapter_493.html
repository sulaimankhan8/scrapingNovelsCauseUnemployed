            <br><br><p>People gave gifts to each other every day.</p><br><p>Sure, it happened much more often on certain days, such as holidays that involved all the people at once.</p><br><p>It could be some important team or company event where employees congratulate themselves on a new accomplishment and exchange gifts.</p><br><p>Naturally, one of the most frequent variants was someone's birthday or a wedding, for example.</p><br><p>Such events had an exact date and also it was clear to whom gifts were to be given, which often made it easier to find a suitable gift.</p><br><p>But, it should not be forgotten that many people gave gifts to their friends and family on random days, just because they wanted to or were in a good mood.</p><br><p>Some people liked to receive gifts more, it seemed that this is how most people should feel, but in practice, there were a lot of people who preferred to give gifts.</p><br><p>Strange as it may seem, the reason for this was not only trivial kindness but also the fact that people who gave gifts always got something in return.</p><br><p>It was not something material, no, such people did not have any selfish goals or ulterior motives.</p><br><p>In return, they received the emotions of the person to whom they gave the gift. For most, this was the greatest and highest reward they could expect.</p><br><p>The emotional expectation was obvious: it was surprise, followed by happiness.</p><br><p>Well, things didn't always go smoothly, but that was life.</p><br><p>Thus, Adam found himself in an unconventional situation for the person giving the gift.</p><br><p>Instead of surprise and joy, he received silence that broke into tears.</p><br><p>Deep inside, Adam wanted to comfort Silvana, but before he dared to do so, he asked one simple question that ripped straight from his heart: "Why...? Why are you crying?"</p><br><p>Adam's voice was filled with concern and slight worry.</p><br><p>What mattered to him was not that Silvana cried after she got the bracelet, but that she cried in general. Adam didn't know the reason and it truly frightened him.</p><br><p>"I... I saw you assembling the bracelet at lunchtime... I'm sorry!!!" Silvana cried like a little girl, looking up hoping that this way the tears would stop flowing from her eyes like rivers.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment as the realization came to him. He understood why Silvana delayed and why her footsteps were so loud. These were deliberate actions, from someone smart who knew what to expect.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Silvana took a deep breath and brushed the tears away from her face, but it hardly made a lasting difference, the tears continued to flow from her eyes.</p><br><p>She realized that she shouldn't have behaved, not in front of Adam, not at all. She was a grown woman, his Operator, not a little child who was ready to cry over any little thing.</p><br><p>"I didn't mean to... It was an accident... I'm sorry." Silvana turned away to the side, continuing to cry quietly. She bit her lip, but it didn't help her much.</p><br><br><p>"Shit..." Silvana clenched her fists tightly, "I know what this company is, how much this bracelet costs, and that it's special... You assembled it for me... put in the time and effort... and I couldn't even show you genuine surprise and joy..."</p><br><p>Silvana didn't stop, she was muttering something to herself, but it was so quiet that it was impossible to understand what she was saying.</p><br><p>"Hey, look at me." Adam said quietly.</p><br><p>Before Silvana could react, Adam gently took her by the shoulder and turned her towards him, their gazes meeting.</p><br><p>Adam looked at her with a slight, understanding smile.</p><br><p>Silvana blamed herself for ruining the surprise, but Adam wasn't about to do that. Read the latest on empire</p><br><p>"Well, it wasn't your fault that you saw the surprise beforehand, and neither was it mine. It just happened, you know?" Adam said in a calm voice, gently caressing her cheek.</p><br><p>"But..." Silvana took a deep breath while tears continued to flow down her red cheeks, "I still messed up..."</p><br><p>Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>"No, since I received something more unique than your bracelet. Though you didn't show sincere joy and surprise, but your tears and concern... that's a treasure that only the real you can give."</p><br><p>Adam continued as he pulled Silvana against him. She snuggled into his shoulder that he gently offered for her crying face.</p><br><p>"When tears sprang from your eyes I was scared, but realizing the reason, seeing how worried you were and what the real you could be... Ah, I'll never forget it."</p><br><p>Adam murmured, gently stroking Silvana's head. She didn't say anything, but clung to his shoulder and back with such strength as if her life depended on it.</p><br><p>"When I first met you, I saw a cold girl with an emotionless face and a strict temper. Gradually, you revealed yourself, especially in difficult moments, but now..."</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly, gently wrapping his arms around Silvana.</p><br><p>"You cried like a child afraid you'd upset me... That you'd ruined the surprise. Damn, that was just marvelous and endlessly cute as well as sincere."</p><br><p>Adam closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. Now all he could hear was her frequent sobs over her crying, muffled by his shoulder.</p><br><p>"So... If you want to cry, go ahead, I won't judge you, on the contrary, I'll enjoy every second of seeing you like this, the real you. Be yourself, be a little child if you want, cry as much as you want."</p><br><p>There was no reply or any action.</p><br><p>There was only silence for a while, until Silvana slowly raised her head, looking at Adam.</p><br><p>She could hardly see anything, as she was blurred by the copious amounts of tears, but she could recognize the kind, caring smile on his face.</p><br><br><br><p>Silvana clutched harder at Adam's back, rumpling his shirt before looking up.</p><br><p>"WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!"</p><br><p>Her cry was loud and bright as a baby's, echoing not only through their floor but to others as well, letting other people hear it.</p><br><p>It was incredibly embarrassing and shameful for Silvana, but she didn't care at the time. She just didn't want to hold back.</p><br><p>She was just following her Phantom's words, no... Adam's words.</p>
