            <br><p>"Well, the time has come. They're on their way here." Gladius said, getting up from the couch, preparing to leave the tall tower, and head straight for the arena.</p><br><p>Osana raised an eyebrow, looking at Gladius baffled.</p><br><p>"How the hell do you know that?"</p><br><p>Gladius silently took a step forward, looking out the panoramic window with his arms folded behind his back.</p><br><p>"I just have good intuition, trust me." Gladius said calmly, giving no hint that he was lying.</p><br><p>At this time, over the ninth wing, above the tall buildings of this part of the Citadel, black ravens flew over. Nothing unusual, but for some reason, there were strangely numerous of them, as if someone brought the wise birds to this place on purpose.</p><br><p>Kogen waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Don't listen to him. If you believe every word he says, it won't end well for you." Kogen shook his head and yawned widely, covering his mouth.</p><br><p>Gladius gave a short sigh.</p><br><p>"Hey, stop ruining my reputation in front of the younger generation, I might take offense after all."</p><br><p>Kogen raised an eyebrow, looking at him in incomprehension.</p><br><p>"You're doing a fine job of it yourself."</p><br><p>Then, before Gladius could say anything, Kogen stepped forward, keeping one hand in his pocket. He didn't approach anyone in particular but stopped in the middle of the group.</p><br><p>"Alright, there's actually not much time left, so let's head to the arena." Kogen said in a tone as if they could do it in the blink of an eye.</p><br><br><p>"Shall we go to the arena? I'm interested to see what it's like to stand on the Moon Colosseum battlefield."</p><br><p>Kogen nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yeah, but we don't need to go anywhere."</p><br><p>Kogen smirked as he raised his right hand high up and snapped his fingers.</p><br><p>At the same moment, his eyes shone brightly and turquoise flames burst from his fingertips. At first, they were thin streams of fire, but in a few moments, they turned into all-consuming flows of active flame.</p><br><p>Everyone but Gladius and Erik grew wary.</p><br><p>Adam was no exception, he frowned heavily and stood in front of Silvana, intending to protect her if necessary. Even if Kogen was acting as their ally, it meant nothing considering the length and reason for their meeting.</p><br><p>"Oh, you shouldn't look at me like that, I don't wish to harm you... At least not anyone in this room. Hahaha!" Kogen laughed ominously as the flames like a whirlwind engulfed them.</p><br><p>The next time Adam opened his eyes, he was in a pitch-black room with no windows, just a single iron door leading to an equally dark passage.</p><br><br><p>Silvana gasped, clinging to Adam before Kogen's aggressive flames surrounded her like a vortex. She thought the fire would hurt her, leave burns, but ...</p><br><p>'Agh...?' Silvana blinked several times staring forward.</p><br><p>Nothing happened. She was perfectly fine, but even though she wasn't injured, the situation changed significantly.</p><br><p>The landscape in front of her was no longer the sight of the night ninth wing, but a massive arena with a thousand seats, some of which were taken by now.</p><br><p>A few seconds were enough for Silvana to realize that somehow they ended up at the top of the Moon Colosseum, where they had the best view of the arena and the would-be fighters.</p><br><p>"Hah... I shouldn't have been scared, I acted stupid, didn't I?" Silvana turned to Adam.</p><br><p>However... there was no one beside her.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide, she turned around, to her horror seeing that everyone but Adam was there.</p><br><p>"Wait... What's going on here? Did something happen to Adam during the transfer here...?" Silvana muttered in a shaky voice.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, there was someone's hand on her shoulder, she turned to her right, then a calm voice came from her left.</p><br><p>"Don't worry, Adam's teleportation was as successful as it was for you." Kogen said in a low voice, his deep eyes passing over the others.</p><br><p>Silvana flinched in surprise, hurriedly throwing Kogen's hand off of her. It didn't embarrass him in any way, only the corner of his mouth turned up in satisfaction at Silvana's reaction.</p><br><p>"Worried about your Phantom? That's right, that's what an Operator should be."</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, not knowing how she was supposed to act, she didn't want to put a complaint to the head of the great family, it was far beyond her level.</p><br><p>"We are in my family's box." Kogen waved his hand heading towards a massive red chair near the edge of the stone ledge.</p><br><p>Then, Kogen sat down in the chair, put one leg over the other, and leaned on his hand.</p><br><p>"This is one of the spectator seats, that's why we're here, but..." Kogen cast a hard look at Silvana, "Adam is not a spectator. He's a fighter. He's not meant to be here as he's meant to be out there."</p><br><p>Kogen stretched his arm forward, pointing to the spacious arena with nothing but a sturdy, gray floor covered in a thin layer of dust due to long periods of downtime.</p><br><p>"Right... he's a fighter." Silvana muttered, she nodded slowly realizing that Kogen's words made sense.</p><br><br><p>Erik strode forward, gripping his cane tightly with both hands, his shoulders wide, his back straight and his gaze directed forward.</p><br><p>"Take your seats and place your bets, for you have very little time left. Soon, the moon will disappear behind the horizon line."</p><br><p>Osana looked up. It had been a few minutes since the sky was completely black, the morning light trying to take its rightful place, gradually driving out the darkness only to switch places again in a few hours.</p><br><p>"Making bets...? Hah, I'm afraid I don't have as much money as you do." Silvana muttered, awkwardly stroking herself on the shoulder.</p><br><p>She wasn't chasing money or status, but the fact that Erik could bet 300 million credits was impressive and frightening at the same time.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Oh, young Silvana, it's not about the money after all. Those who bet to make money will inevitably lose their fortune." Explore stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Agh...? Then what's the point?"</p><br><p>Eirk smirked, lifting the corner of his hat.</p><br><p>"Isn't it obvious? To pique your interest and strengthen your faith in your chosen fighter. So go ahead, don't be afraid to place your bet. In the purple room, there are no limits. You can bet as little as one credit, as much as one billion."</p><br><p>Silvana smiled bitterly before pulling out her phone.</p><br><br><br><p>At the same moment, before Adam could leave the dark room, a raven was heading towards him.</p><br><p>There wouldn't be anything remarkable about the raven if it weren't for its twin pupils and the influence of someone who controlled everything from afar.</p>
