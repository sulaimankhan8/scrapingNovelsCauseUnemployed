            <br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Sano's gloves were actively trembling, causing her hands and then her entire body to shake.</p><br><p>She wasn't worried, as this was part of her attack that she was going to end the Shadow's life with.</p><br><p>The Shadow turned his head at a strange angle, staring intently at the towering Sano above him.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>A multitude of branches trembled, heading towards Sano, aiming to pierce her with their sharp thorns.</p><br><p>But, Sano wasn't going to dodge.</p><br><br><p>Her fists rained down on the Shadow in a hail, landing several blows per second. She was just attacking at random points below her, she had no specific target.</p><br><p>Sano's job was to destroy everything underneath her with her combat gloves and high-speed strikes, as long as her exoskeleton and FN still had enough energy.</p><br><p>The massive gloves simply broke branches, shattering them into splinters and preventing the Shadow from leaving even a scratch on Sano.</p><br><p>The Shadow was badly injured after Natta's attack, he was literally missing half of his torso, so his options were severely limited. He was channeling some of his strength to contain the bleeding and keep himself alive.</p><br><p>If they met in Dead Lands and there was only Natta against the Shadow, the Shadow would definitely not die. At best he would have killed Natta and eaten her, and at worst he would just run away, but death was out of the question.</p><br><p>But, they weren't in the Dead Lands, there was nowhere to escape to, and Natta wasn't alone.</p><br><br><p>After ten seconds of relentless flurries of blows, Sano completely obliterated the branches on the Shadow's chest, leaving only darkness behind the rough skin and bones.</p><br><p>The Shadow tried to fight back, but there was nothing he could do. Sano's blows were practiced, quick and precise, leaving the monster not even half a second to think and decide how to get out of this deadly situation.</p><br><p>Natta, watching this scene smirked. Then, she reached into her belt and opened a plate that concealed three iron syringes with red liquid.</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Natta injected the syringe directly into her right shoulder.</p><br><p>Her face contorted in pain and her veins swelled, but after a few seconds, she regained her senses and took a deep breath.</p><br><p>"That's much better."</p><br><p>Natta smiled slightly before swinging her right arm, straightening it, putting all the joints and bones back into place. Her arm was broken just ten seconds ago, but now it was fine as if she hadn't received any wounds.</p><br><p>At the same time, Natta felt a powerful pressure and someone's gaze.</p><br><p>It obviously wasn't coming from the Shadow, who only had a few seconds to live, as Sano wasn't going to stop until there was nothing left of the monster.</p><br><p>Natta quickly identified the source of the threat and pointed her head upward, meeting Aiden's gaze.</p><br><p>His expression was calm, but that only made it scarier.</p><br><p>"Oh, I thought we could use healing syringes..." Natta scratched the back of her head awkwardly, trying to excuse herself, though she knew Aiden didn't like it when they wasted combat gear unless it was necessary.</p><br><br><p>'Shit... Looks like this is going to get me in trouble, but... it wouldn't be the first time.' Natta internally shook her head, realizing that when this was over, she would have to answer before Aiden.</p><br><br><br><p>The Shadow let out a strange wheeze, his body shuddering as he thrust his branches into the ground trying to rise that way. But, a second later, a barrage of blows rained down on him, driving him into the steel floor.</p><br><p>"Die! Die! Die! Fucking die!"</p><br><p>Sano exclaimed with a mad grin on her face as her fists began ripping the Shadow's flesh to shreds.</p><br><p>Droplets of blood flew before her excited eyes, chunks of flesh flying off to the sides leaving crimson stains on the ground. Explore hidden tales at empire</p><br><p>The long thin bones meant to protect their owner could do nothing against Sano's endless attacks, cracks running through the bones, following their shattering into tiny pieces.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, there was virtually nothing left of the Shadow.</p><br><p>The dangerous White Threat Monster which was stronger than many of its kin, was simply destroyed by the blows of the ordinary human who used the exoskeleton and the False Nexus.</p><br><p>However, Sano was different from most humans. Many experienced military men in her place would not have performed as well, since it required true desire and bloodlust.</p><br><p>"Hehehe, I told you I would do it." Sano chuckled evilly looking at the already dead Shadow.</p><br><p>As is always the case in such cases, Sano did not have the Spark and could not absorb the gene of the Shadow. To do so, she had to kill the monster without the exoskeleton and False Nexus, as Glara was about to do.</p><br><p>"Hey, how long did it take us?" Sano asked looking at Natta.</p><br><p>Natta cast a sidelong glance and calmly replied:</p><br><p>"Fifty seconds, much faster than we thought, but it looks like she won't need our help." Natta muttered staring intently at Glara.</p><br><p>Glara wasted no time, she only had half a minute of the Code D action left, and she made sure that by this point her victory was closer than ever.</p><br><p>The Redcore Wolf was badly wounded, with shield cuts all over his body and gory wounds left by several plasma shots.</p><br><p>By that point, Glara only had a charge of eight left in her shotgun, and her shield already lost all of its energy, the blades no longer spinning, and the plasma coating no more turned on.</p><br><p>"Rgha... Rgha... Rgha..." The Redcore Wolf was breathing heavily, faintly looking at Glara who was in the same state.</p><br><p>At this time, Sano and Natta looked at Aiden, waiting for his instructions.</p><br><p>Considering that there were three of them now, and the Redcore Wolf was exhausted, they could easily kill this monster. However, no matter what happened next, it wouldn't change the fact that the Redcore Wolf's genes were already affected by the interference of Sano and Natta.</p><br><p>There was no way Glara could become the Naturalborn Phantom in such a situation, since when she wanted to absorb the Redcore Wolf's genes, some of them would come along with Sano and Natta's genes, destroying themselves in the process, right inside her inner space before the Spark should erupt.</p><br><p>But... before that, she still had to kill the Redcore Wolf.</p><br><p>Aiden waved his hand, indicating for Sano and Natta not to interfere. Not that it would solve anything, but he wanted Glara to kill the Redcore Wolf on her own, it was important for her future as the Artificial Phantom, no, just the Phantom.</p><br><p>Sano and Natta nodded, jumping aside. Now, they had become watchers, and they would only act if Aiden gave the order.</p><br><p>Even if Glara was in mortal danger, they wouldn't move until Aiden decided to.</p><br><p>They were very aware of how rigid and non-negotiable the hierarchy was at Morton Observatory.</p><br><p>"Fine, let's get this over with." Glara spat out a clot of blood.</p><br><p>That blood didn't come from the wounds from the Redcore Wolf but from the fact that her body was nearing its death.</p><br><p>She had twenty seconds left and even her appearance looked much older due to the detrimental effects of Code D.</p><br><br><p>The Redcore Wolf growled before lunging forward, opening its jaw wide.</p>
