            <br><p>The energy in an active flow filled the Evolution Tree, allowing it to become a little bigger and stronger.</p><br><p>It was having the same effect on Adam, but he was too focused on his thoughts about his future trials.</p><br><p>And also... about what he would do afterward.</p><br><p>'The Lower Ring and the mystery of the Citadel...' he inwardly muttered, his eyes deep as the abyss, 'What awaits me after this? A simple Phantom job who will wander the Dead Lands and carry out government missions?'</p><br><p>He sighed heavily, shaking his head.</p><br><p>"I don't know... Well, that's not what I should be thinking about right now."</p><br><br><p>Adam turned around, watching as the last drops from the Stellar Flow filled his Evolution Tree. He grew a little stronger, but it was only a small bonus compared to the Full Energy Control or the power he would receive when he reached the limit of the K3-Level.</p><br><p>Before leaving his inner space, Adam's eyes lowered to the base of the tree, looking at the Lock.</p><br><p>Two keyholes out of three were already open. Only one key remained, after that, Adam would reach K4-Level. He understood that as well as any Phantom in his position.</p><br><p>"But..." he stammered, "When I create the third key and the lock disappears, what will I need to do to reach the Second Circle?"</p><br><p>Left without an answer, Adam left his inner space.</p><br><br><p>Lone Blaze and Moira floated out of the Initial Gene, looking at the Evolution Tree with slight concern.</p><br><p>"After the last fight, he's gotten kind of weird." Lone Blaze gulped.</p><br><p>"Yeah..." Moira nodded. "When he fought against Kyros, he was completely different... He looks alive."</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree was quick to reassure them. It might have seemed it was acting like an old man in front of them, and... it was exactly like that.</p><br><p>[It happens to him sometimes... You just work with Adam quite a bit... After all, I've been with him since the beginning... Well... Unfortunately, at one, his very first battle I wasn't there yet...]</p><br><p>"So..." Moira's eyes ran from Lone Blaze to the Evolution Tree, "Is he going to be alright?"</p><br><p>[Yes... I would say that at times like this, Adam is growing up... Because of the many events that have happened to him, his mind is much older than his body...]</p><br><br><p>[This happens to many Phantoms... Although, I think you've already figured that out without my help...]</p><br><p>Then, Lone Blaze and Moira nodded before returning to the Initial Gene together.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree had many thoughts about Adam's monologue, but expressing them in the void did not much sense.</p><br><p>[In the end... I'll be with Adam from the beginning to the end... No matter what path he chooses...]</p><br><br><p>Toward lunchtime of the seventh day, Adam woke up, he had been out since his fight against Erik.</p><br><p>He didn't go into the kitchen, he didn't know if everyone was home now or if Silvana, Chloe, and Julia hadn't returned yet.</p><br><p>Instead, he headed for the shower and didn't get out until an hour later.</p><br><p>He stood under the powerful stream of water for a long time, getting his thoughts in order. He wanted to do all things at once, but trying to fulfill this was a big mistake.</p><br><p>"Alright..." Adam stood in front of the mirror as he ran a hand through his wet hair. "I'm sure everything will be ready soon. Otherwise, Erik and Julia would have burst into my room by now."</p><br><p>Without hurry, Adam got dressed, by the time he came out to the kitchen, it was already evening.</p><br><p>Silvana could see what he was doing through shared sight if she was worried, but Adam knew she didn't do that. He would have sensed it immediately.</p><br><p>The first to notice him was Erik, who was holding glasses of dark wine.</p><br><p>"Look who finally decided to wake up."</p><br><p>"Adam!" Silvana exclaimed and ran up to him, hugging him tightly.</p><br><p>She looked up, looking at him with her head tilted.</p><br><p>"Is everything alright? Your exam ended last night, you've been in your room for almost 24 hours."</p><br><p>In response, she received a slight smile. Adam's eyes grew softer as he suddenly kissed her forehead in front of everyone.</p><br><p>She blushed heavily. Even though they were in a relationship, officially, she wasn't used to it yet. This was all new and unexplored to her.</p><br><p>"Yeah... I just spent too much time thinking about it. It's nothing serious. By the way..." Adam swept his gaze across the table, stopping at Julia, "Where have you been?"</p><br><p>Silvana took a deep breath, took a step back, and smiled weakly.</p><br><p>"Training with Mrs. Julia has proven much harder than with Mr. Erik, but... it was worth it! The three of us were at the hot springs all day yesterday! It... it was relaxing!"</p><br><p>Chloe, with her mouth full, nodded a few times. "Mhm!"</p><br><p>"Hahah..." Adam laughed briefly as he stared again at Julia, who was nonchalantly drinking bitter coffee, "As always, cold and hard on the outside may well be soft and kind on the inside, right?"</p><br><p>Julia raised an eyebrow, casting a sharp look at him, "Boy, are you a philosopher? You're not old enough to study me yet. Sit back, chew, and be quiet."</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Adam didn't argue and sat down next to Silvana, who hurried to help him with his food.</p><br><p>Reinz, who had been silent the whole time, just shook his head with a weak smile.</p><br><p>Looking at the table full of food and the expensive wine standing in the center like a treasure, Adam shrugged.</p><br><p>"Well, from the looks of it, this is the last dinner in this house, right?"</p><br><p>Erik, swaying his wine glass, smirked. "Absolutely. So enjoy it properly. At the Lower Ring, it will be hard to find a quiet and peaceful place, especially with food and wine like here. However... At the Lower Ring, there is everything, both luxury and poverty."</p><br><p>Cutting up a piece of meat, Adam rolled his eyes ironically.</p><br><p>"Just like everywhere else. There's no changing that."</p><br>
