            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1253: Sword and the Eyes (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Previously, monsters were unable to attack the Red Bloom; more precisely, all their attempts ended in failure. When she first arrived at the dark forest, she quickly killed several powerful monsters and, taking advantage of the chaos, created a powerful barrier around herself.</p><br><p>Gradually, with the help of her energy and a few foolish monsters who decided they had a chance against her, the Red Bloom strengthened her position and eventually managed to create an entire system that worked to her advantage.</p><br><p>Sure, her experience helped her, as she had done this before, and this tactic always worked.</p><br><p>This time was no exception.</p><br><p>Garrah, the Thorn Hunter, and the Dark Blobs were unable to defeat her, although they came close once. They had a chance to fight because they were able to break through her barrier, and it was after this incident that the Red Bloom created four crystals that strengthened her defenses to a new level.</p><br><p>But after Adam appeared, most of her tools became useless.</p><br><p>If Adam didn’t have the task of reaching the Forgotten Hills to obtain the Connected Heart, he could have destroyed her outer barrier by putting all his strength into the attack.</p><br><p>That would have been reckless and even foolish.</p><br><p>Sure, he would also expend energy in the battle against the Red Bloom, but he would have time to recover. The Connected String would show him the way at any time.</p><br><br><p>From the north, the ground shook with the sound of approaching footsteps. Dozens of monsters followed four figures, leading hundreds of weaker ones behind them.</p><br><p>Though it was unlikely that any of these monsters would be able to take an active part against the Red Bloom herself. It was not their level, and if they did, they would simply die in a matter of seconds.</p><br><p>However, they knew what the Red Bloom was capable of and that their help would actually be useful.</p><br><p>Adam, running ahead with Garrah, narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>Now, he saw for the first time the great bud that Garrah and the others had spoken of.</p><br><p>The majestic bud lay right on the ground, saturating the soil with hundreds of roots that spread throughout the dark forest with only one purpose — to absorb energy from the depths and all the resources their tips could reach.</p><br><p>Deep inside the bud, the Red Bloom was hiding. She did not decide to show herself even now.</p><br><p>She still had a barrier flashing around her bud, as well as an entire army ready to defend her.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>As soon as Adam got close enough, the ground shook as hundreds of dark tips appeared.</p><br><p>Adam and the others stopped abruptly.</p><br><p>“What is that?” Adam asked, warily.</p><br><p>Garrah narrowed his eyes. “I don’t know… There was nothing like this last time.”</p><br><p>The Dark Blobs trembled.</p><br><br><p>“Yes! I think so too!”</p><br><p>“Let’s cut the roots!”</p><br><p>Before they could come to a decision, a red bud appeared from each tip, like a copy of the great one, but much smaller.</p><br><p>The buds flattened as they rose upward, opening into several wide petals.</p><br><p>From each bud emerged a monster similar to the bloom guards, but without armor or weapons, and with the same red crystal instead of a head. They were much weaker in both appearance and aura, but their strength lay in their numbers.</p><br><br><p>The great bud trembled once as all the bloom soldiers rushed forward.</p><br><p>Adam frowned, thinking about which ability would be most effective to deal with them all at once.</p><br><p>‘Tsk, I don’t want to waste a lot of energy on these weaklings, but it seems I have no other choice.’</p><br><p>However, before he could do anything, the monsters descended on the bloom soldiers like a cascade of shadows, engaging in battle with the Red Bloom’s army.</p><br><p>“Agh…?” Adam blinked several times, puzzled.</p><br><p>This wasn’t the first time he had worked together with monsters, but this had never happened before. The weaker monsters didn’t let the Bloom Soldiers get close to him and the others.</p><br><p>‘Adam, they understand that only the four of you can change the situation. Don’t forget, at this level, monsters are quite intelligent, even if they aren’t the Awakened Ones.’</p><br><p>The corners of his lips curved upward as a gleam appeared in his eyes.</p><br><p>“Yeah, you’re right.”</p><br><p>Then, he turned to the Dark Blobs and the Thorn Hunter.</p><br><p>“So, now it’s your turn to break the barrier, right?”</p><br><p>The Thorn Hunter nodded as he swung his blades, clashing them together. Sparks flew before his serious, red eyes.</p><br><p>“Indeed. It will cost us dearly, but we will force her to leave this bud that is drying up our forest.”</p><br><p>The Dark Blobs trembled as they followed the Thorn Hunter.</p><br><p>“Yes! We use our full power!”</p><br><br><p>“Just like last time!”</p><br><p>Without delay, not distracted by the countless battles around him, the Thorn Hunter threw his blades upward.</p><br><p>The Dark Blobs jumped up, splitting into six per blade. In just a few seconds, they transformed the two dark blades into a massive, great sword with a wide blade.</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Adam as he studied this strange weapon.</p><br><p>Then, a dozen eyes opened along the blade of the sword, each looking in different directions, but soon all the pupils focused on one point—the Red Bloom.</p><br><br><p>Standing in a fighting stance, the Thorn Hunter grabbed the hilt with both hands. A rattle sounded from his armor as the ground beneath his feet cracked.</p><br><p>Despite being an Elder in terms of power, he struggled to hold this sword. All the power of the Dark Blobs turned into weight that the Thorn Hunter could barely bear.</p><br><p>On the other hand, he didn’t need much time.</p><br><p>“You protected yourself with so many barriers… All so that we could break them one by one!” The Thorn Hunter exclaimed before making a wide swing.</p><br><p>As soon as the blade touched the ground, a crimson wave of darkness burst from the sword, preserving the ghostly silhouettes of all twelve eyes.</p><br><p>The Red Bloom flinched, preparing to open the bud to stop the wave, but it was too late.</p><br><p>Her last line of defense would be destroyed.</p>
