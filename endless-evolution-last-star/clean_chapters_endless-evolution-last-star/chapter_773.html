            <br><br><p>A wave of eerie silence covered the Lands of the Lone Serpent, but no one knew why. It seemed that some monster used a unique ability to remove all sounds at once.</p><br><p>It was a result of their instincts, every monster and Phantom, something deep inside made them stop, there were no exceptions.</p><br><p>A strange aura emerged in lonely streams from beneath the black sand and the high layers of snow brought by the frost - the crimson fog reached the surface.</p><br><p>But, along with it, the souls of the monsters were filled with a new feeling, they succeeded, but no one realized it, the monsters looked at each other in confusion. They were in the middle of a battle, only half of the Eclipse had passed, yet something made them think as if they already won.</p><br><p>However, there were two exceptions on the battlefield, the Dormant Lord and the Blind Sinner.</p><br><p>These two were wary, unlike the other monsters that felt the growing excitement.</p><br><p>There were no shockwaves like during Adam's evolution, still, the Phantoms felt goosebumps from the unknown aura.</p><br><p>No one was afraid, and the Phantoms and the monsters shared one strange feeling: they wanted to bend the knee, though they didn't know in front of whom.</p><br><p>Katrin shuddered, her legs shaking slightly, just like the other Phantoms. She once again felt as insignificant as she had in front of Blind Sinner when he compared her to a bug.</p><br><p>"Alan... What is it? Why do I feel so weak?"</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Katrin's fear transferred to Alan as well, after all, they were connected through her inner space as much as any Phantom &amp; Operator after the completion of the Gene Diffusion.</p><br><p>Alan's teeth were chattering, he could barely muster the strength to say anything:</p><br><p>'It's... I don't know... I've heard of such a thing, but... I don't want to jump to conclusions since it should be impossible... This fortress is too close to Pacific Lands...'</p><br><p>His answer didn't tell Katrin much useful information, yet she realized that the matter was bad.</p><br><p>With a horrified grimace, Katrin directed her gaze downward. She knew who was responsible for this.</p><br><p>'Unknown Phantom... What on earth are you doing up there? Instead of helping us, you're just constantly making life difficult while we're out here trying to survive!'</p><br><p>Naturally, no one could get to Adam. It was simply impossible since without External Artifact's help, they couldn't find a way into the maze, much less into the caves.</p><br><p>The Phantoms could only hope that the aura carrying the cold down their backs would remain in the depths of the fortress, and they wouldn't have to deal with it.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, the two creatures awakened from their sleep and stared at each other.</p><br><p>Adam was staring at an unusual monster that looked like a Crown Type but had a strange aura.</p><br><p>Unlike the Phantoms and monsters above, Adam, standing right in front of the man, felt nothing.</p><br><p>He didn't have any emotions, only a slight curiosity was visible in his eyes.</p><br><p>'So... Lone Blaze was afraid of this monster's awakening? Although, that's not what's important right now. Why is it able to talk? This is the first time, does that mean he's special?'</p><br><p>Unlike Adam, the monster had no intention of just staring at each other in silence.</p><br><p>"You, I ask you again..."</p><br><p>The man's voice rang through the temple, imperious and unwavering. The purple snake settled on his shoulder and narrowed its eyes, ready to devour Adam if he dared to ignore its lord's question.</p><br><p>"Are you my servant?"</p><br><p>Before Adam could answer anything, the man continued looking down at Adam from above, he was hovering a few centimeters over the crimson pond.</p><br><p>"It seems my question is rhetorical, it should be, but... Why don't I sense any fear from you? Why are you not yet kneeling before me?"</p><br><p>Then, the man's eyes went wide for a moment, sensing Adam's serene aura.</p><br><p>"Oh... I see, how foolish of me to expect you to obey, for you are not a monster... you are a human."</p><br><br><p>The monster lowered himself to the edge of the pond and took a few steps forward. The hiding monsters of the temple in the distance came into his sight, unlike Adam who stood confidently on his feet, they trembled, their heads lowered.</p><br><p>Adam's silence didn't annoy the monster, on the contrary, it gave the man time to think and come to a not-so-obvious conclusion:</p><br><p>"You're lucky I'm not a fool, just because you're a human doesn't mean you can't be on my side, does it? Apparently... you were the one who awakened me."</p><br><p>The man put a hand to his chest as he lifted his chin slightly.</p><br><p>"For that, accept my gratitude."</p><br><p>At that moment, doubt appeared in the man's eyes. He looked around, seeing the familiar pillars of the temple, but the aura, the cold and rocky rock parts of the caverns, found no place in his memories.</p><br><p>"How strange... It doesn't seem like I'm supposed to be here. Could this be an anomaly? How unfortunate... in the global scheme of things, it has not much of an impact."</p><br><p>Fully recovering from his long awakening, the monster directed his gaze at Adam once more.</p><br><p>"So, what's your answer a human? Are you on my side? Are you my servant? Remember, no matter who you are or what you are capable of, the best you can hope for right now is to be my loyal servant."</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam finally decided to say something. His blue eyes shone brightly, the stellar effect of evolution still lingering, absorbing the monster's gaze within him.</p><br><p>"I have a few questions for you as well. Why can you talk and who are you?"</p><br><p>The man's eyebrow went up, surprise evident on his face.</p><br><p>"Your first question. I'm confused, I don't know how to answer something so stupid. Perhaps you're the type to ask why a bird can fly. There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to talk."</p><br><p>After a few seconds, the monster continued, extending his arm out to the side.</p><br><p>"What about your second question... I'll have to find out for myself first. There might be changes over a long period..."</p><br><p>At the same moment, space distorted, streams of energy from the surrounding environment traveled towards the man's hand, becoming a mist full of stars.</p><br><p>Among the vibrant sparks, snow-white runes appeared with unknown meaning to Adam, but they carried the name of the monster standing before him.</p>
