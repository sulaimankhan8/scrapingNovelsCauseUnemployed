            <br><p>Silvana was usually quick to understand the situation because she analyzed everything. Her job as an Operator also affected this since it was part of her duties.</p><br><p>However, Lone Blaze's actions put her in a daze, she didn't understand what was going on here and the fact that Evolution Tree was involved made the situation more complex.</p><br><p>Lona Blaze tilted her head, the slight kind smile contrasting strongly with her cruel, devious expression earlier.</p><br><p>"Hey, cutie, we don't have much time. Pretty soon the Crimson Monarch will realize that Adam has no way to heal his arm. He'll just fly into the fortress and knock Adam out, then take him away. We could lose Adam."</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, emphasizing Lone Blaze's last words.</p><br><p>"We...? You're not going to disappear after the pact is over?"</p><br><p>In response, Lone Blaze stepped forward, dissipating in a fiery flash only to appear right in front of Silvana.</p><br><p>"I see... Looks like I gave you quite a scare, but... even in theory, I couldn't replace you."</p><br><p>"W-Why...?" Silvana's voice trembled, she was still afraid that Lone Blaze would try to take my place.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze rested one hand on her hips as she took a deep breath.</p><br><p>"I won't hide it. What I was talking about is possible. One factor aside, in theory, I can replace you, even a monster can replace you no matter how strange it sounds."</p><br><br><p>Lone Blaze nodded, then she pointed to the Evolution Seed.</p><br><p>"You were chosen by Adam. There's no way he'd change you for anyone or anything. I'm sure if he'd heard what I was saying a minute ago, I wouldn't be here now."</p><br><p>A bitter smile appeared on her face, with a slight regret that it was true.</p><br><p>"He would have immediately broken the pact, thrown me out of his inner space, and destroyed me."</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Silvana's heart began to beat faster, the thud that she could barely hear, was loud enough for Lone Blaze:</p><br><p>"Oh, poor girl... Well, that's not what this is about right now."</p><br><p>"No! You've got it all wrong!"</p><br><p>Lone Blaze waved her hand nonchalantly, she shrugged.</p><br><p>"Sure, sure. So... What do you say about my offer? Are you willing to take Adam's wound on yourself?"</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Silvana's body, her mind conjured up Adam's contorted face in pain and his mangled hand.</p><br><p>She was an Operator, not a Phantom or military, she had rarely fought except for a few sparring sessions at the academy.</p><br><p>Her worst wound was getting cut while cooking or breaking a nail, it hurt but it was nothing compared to what Adam went through.</p><br><p>"Y-Yes..." her voice shook, fear filling her eyes, "However...I don't know what you mean at all. How can I take over his wound? Why am I hearing about this from you?"</p><br><p>"Because it was my plan. The Evolution Tree approved it, so I sprang into action. I need Adam to win. For me, unlike him, it's a matter of life and death. And... you and I have a lot of work ahead."</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes, eyeing Lone Blaze suspiciously. She no longer felt threatened by her, but... she didn't like being in the role of the unaware.</p><br><p>"About your question. As with Adam, there are some things you shouldn't know ahead of time. Especially you, miss Operator.</p><br><p>The confusion in Silvana's eyes became clearer, yet she realized that neither Lone Blaze nor the Evolution Tree was going to tell her anything right now.</p><br><p>"But, this is an emergency right now. We all understand that."</p><br><p>Then, Lone Blaze took a step back and pointed at the Evolution Seed.</p><br><p>"Come over to it, and you'll figure it out for yourself. I'll help you with energy if you need it."</p><br><p>However, instead of immediately springing into action, Silvana frowned. One thing remained unknown to her.</p><br><p>"Couldn't I have done this before? I mean, without your intervention and your performance that made me cry?"</p><br><p>"Hah, don't judge me harshly for that. That part of the plan is on Evolution Tree, not on me."</p><br><p>Lone Blaze looked away, her eyes growing deeper, thinking about Silvana's reaction.</p><br><p>"He's as lucky as you..." she muttered before pointing at the Evolution Seed again, "Even if you somehow came here and touched it, the Evolution Tree wouldn't let you do anything."</p><br><p>"I see... Even though it's a seed gift to me, the Evolution Tree still has complete control over all spaces."</p><br><p>Lone Blaze nodded approvingly.</p><br><p>"Yeah, something like that. Well, there's no more time to waste - go ahead."</p><br><p>With a slight hesitation, Silvana clenched her fists and headed towards the Evolution Seed.</p><br><p>She didn't know what to expect, but if it could help Adam, then she would do it, at any cost.</p><br><p>Her green eyes reflected a tiny star floating in the darkness, seemingly unaware of the events around her.</p><br><p>It was still a great mystery to her what the Evolution Seed was capable of. She didn't believe that one day she would have an Evolution Tree of her own, it was impossible, but... she wanted to believe that as an Operator her journey was not yet complete.</p><br><p>"Well... Let's see what you're hiding."</p><br><br><p>Silvana touched the seed with her fingertip, a bright flash engulfed her in an instant.</p><br><p>The next moment Silvana blinked, only able to see dozens of silhouettes surrounding her in the vast darkness.</p><br><p>Without breaking the silence, Silvana took a frightened step back. She didn't know the nature of the silhouettes, cautiously looking around.</p><br><p>She didn't notice as she approached one of them.</p><br><br><p>Silvana abruptly turned back to see a shadow slowly falling from the silhouette, revealing a familiar figure to her.</p><br><br><p>Her Phantom stood before her, but... something was wrong.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes were blank, lacking any hint of their deep blue color. Moreover, Adam was covered in wounds, with several cuts on his hands, and bruises in his abdomen area.</p><br><p>Then, the darkness left one silhouette after another, each had different wounds, but none of the cuts or scratches looked random.</p><br><br><p>Before Silvana could realize anything, a red star appeared in the distance, the distinct smell of blood filling the unfamiliar space.</p>
