            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1170: Everyone wants a family</strong></p><br><p>“Why would I want that?”</p><br><p>Adam’s question stumped Mariam. She had spent a long time telling him about his pure bloodline, his unique characteristics, and how he could influence the final outcome by eating monster meat and choosing a female Hybrid as his partner.</p><br><p>But all she got was a blank stare. He genuinely didn’t understand the point of it all.</p><br><p>The information was useful, but nothing more.</p><br><p>Mariam gulped, her eyes darting from side to side as she tried to think of something to say.</p><br><p>“What…? What are you talking about, Adam?”</p><br><p>Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>“Mariam, what’s the point? Even if I agreed that night and we went to a hotel, what would happen next? You would give birth to a child, and he would die in six years? I used you as an example, but the same can be said about anyone who plans to have a child before the World Wipe.”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Mariam felt relieved to hear his explanation. She didn’t yet know that this was only a small part of his confusion.</p><br><br><p>Mariam sighed with a slight smile.</p><br><p>“What I’m offering you will only happen after the World Wipe. Of course, neither I nor any other woman of the K4-Level is going to give birth before the World Wipe, it would bring nothing but grief and pain.</p><br><p>“However, nothing is stopping those plans from coming to fruition after the World Wipe. I mean, it’s only seven years. They’ll fly by in the blink of an eye, you won’t even notice!”</p><br><p>Mariam wasn’t exaggerating. For people like her, seven years really wasn’t a long time.</p><br><p>It wasn’t just that this wouldn’t be her first World Wipe, and she was several hundred years old. No, it was how human perception of time worked in general.</p><br><p>For children aged 8-10, waiting a whole month for an event seemed like an eternity, but when a person got older, around 18-25, a month didn’t seem so long anymore.</p><br><p>The reason was that the waiting period remained the same — a month — but the amount of time a person had lived varied.</p><br><p>Thus, for a person who is already 100 years old, waiting a month was less than 0.1% of their life, while for an 8-year-old child, it was much more than 2-3% because few people remembered what happened in the first years of their life.</p><br><p>Thus, for Mariam, seven years was a short period, but for Adam, it was almost half of his life, considering his early years.</p><br><p>He had been the Phantom for just over a year, and during that time, a huge number of events had taken place. He couldn’t imagine how much more would happen in the next seven years before the World Wipe.</p><br><p>“Mariam…” Adam’s low voice rang out. “You don’t understand me. Why do I need a family? I want to save my family. How can I think about having a child with some woman right after the World Wipe when my family will be turned into nothing just a few days before that!”</p><br><br><p>Adam slammed his fist on the table in frustration.</p><br><p>“What’s more, stop suggesting that I or other women from the Crimson Path! You’re forgetting that I have Silvana, my Operator!”</p><br><p>Mariam leaned back in her chair, slowly rocking her glass from side to side.</p><br><p>“Well, Adam, nothing is stopping you from having children with several women, including Silvana. I understand that you are young, but when I talk about children, blood, and genes, that’s all I’m talking about. Your love for Silvana and her love for you, your feelings, will remain unchanged, as only you can influence that.”</p><br><br><p>She took a deep sip, emptying the glass, and immediately reached for the bottle.</p><br><p>“Although I understand what you mean, Adam. Like anyone who has recently learned about the World Wipe, you still have hope that you can stop the endless struggle between the First Star and the Last Star, but… do you really believe that?”</p><br><p>Adam said nothing, but he clenched his teeth and balled his fists tightly.</p><br><p>“All the most powerful beings in this world have tried and failed, Damien, Frida, even the most powerful Lords. However, the result is always the same. I don’t blame you, Adam. I was once in your place and had the same thoughts, but here we are.”</p><br><p>Filling her glass, Mariam’s gaze became more serious.</p><br><p>“Adam, think about it from another angle. Given your pure bloodline and other factors, if you have several children with female Hybrids of the Crimson Path and Silvana, you may have a family.”</p><br><p>For a few seconds, Adam’s eyes widened with realization.</p><br><p>“Are you talking about…?”</p><br><br><p>“Yes. As you know, anyone weaker than the K4-Level simply cannot survive the World Wipe. That means that to have a family, you need your parents or your children to be strong enough to survive, that is, to reach the K4-Level.</p><br><p>“Unfortunately, your parents don’t have that option, even in theory. But… your children are a different case entirely.”</p><br><p>Then, she leaned forward as her large red eyes reflected his expression.</p><br><p>“If you do everything right, 8 or 9 out of 10 of your children will become Phantoms. That’s no guarantee that any of them will become a K4-Phantom, but it’s a pretty good chance. The rest will die, but if even one of them makes it, you’ll have a family that won’t disappear in the next World Wipe.”</p><br><p>Adam shuddered, he understood where Mariam was going with this.</p><br><p>“What do you say, Adam? Now it doesn’t sound so bad, right? I won’t deny that losing your family is terrible, most K4-Phantoms go through it, but you have a chance to prevent it from happening again.</p><br><p>“Think about it. You only have seven years now. You were able to become a K4-Phantom in a year, but your children will have 250 years! Given your purity of blood and choice of partner, you can practically guarantee that they will become Phantoms!”</p><br><p>Slowly, Mariam returned to her chair and took a deep sip of wine.</p><br><p>“Everyone wants to have a family, forever, and you and I are no exception. You have that opportunity, Adam. You can start right after the World Wipe, in just seven years.”</p>
