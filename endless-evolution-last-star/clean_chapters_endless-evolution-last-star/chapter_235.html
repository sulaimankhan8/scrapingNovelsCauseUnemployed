            <br><br><p>Nessa opened the door, stepping inside cautiously, as if afraid of doing something wrong in Magnus's presence.</p><br><p>Adam was acting more relaxed. Anyway, Magnus was a simple man, surely he had Phantoms protectors, but right now, they were the only ones here.</p><br><p>Inside, they saw the man standing with his back to them, in front of a lab table. There were many flasks in this room, both with chemicals and flesh, each piece of flesh belonging to a different monster, as was clear from their colors: some were the usual red, and some were blue or even yellow.</p><br><p>Magnus's face was not yet visible, but from the back, one could see a lot of things. Unlike ordinary doctors or lab workers, who always wore white coats, Magnus had a crimson one, long with black edges and no collar.</p><br><p>"You're already here." Magnus said quietly, he seemed to be focused on something important that required his concentration.</p><br><p>Then, Magnus waved a hand that held a sharp scalpel and said:</p><br><p>"Nessa, come here. I need your help. Adam and Silvana, you can look. It's somewhat related to what I'm going to offer you as treatment." Magnus said calmly, which was very different from his voice earlier, at the entrance from the speakers.</p><br><p>Nessa gulped as she approached him, standing to his right.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana ended up on his left, and their eyes went wide for a moment.</p><br><p>On the table, in two glass blocks were two identical pieces of flesh, oddly enough they were moving and quite active as if they were alive.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow. He didn't know what these monsters were, it seemed like it used to be some special monster or even an entire species.</p><br><p>"Here, when I make the incision quickly pour it inside." Magnus handed Nessa a flask with some kind of cold liquid.</p><br><p>Nessa nodded silently.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Magnus waved his hand, making a perfect cut. Immediately, the pieces of flesh, like threads, began to fuse together, but they didn't have time, for the cold liquid began to freeze them.</p><br><p>In just a few seconds, the flesh chunk turned completely to ice, frozen like a statue, and it only took one push to shatter it into small pieces.</p><br><p>Soon, the flesh began to shake, as if it wanted to free itself from its icy captivity, but Magnus didn't let that happen. He struck the piece of flesh, shattering it into pieces.</p><br><p>"Hmm. So, this compound is useless as well. Nothing surprising, though. Nessa, next time, pour a little more, this was barely enough. I gave you exactly as much as you needed." Magnus said calmly, but something in his voice made Nessa gulp before nodding.</p><br><p>"Sure. I understand." Nessa replied, placing the flask on the table.</p><br><p>Then, Magnus turned to Adam and Silvana, revealing himself fully. He had pale skin, sharp facial features, and deep green eyes that were like a snake's that could see through its prey.</p><br><p>Magnus seemed a little malnourished, as was evident in his prominent cheekbones and thin wrists.</p><br><p>He had scarlet hair slicked back, a piercing in his right ear, and black-rimmed glasses that were clearly decorative. A skilled scientist like him could cure any eye disease, that was for sure.</p><br><p>"So? Are you done examining me?" Magnus muttered, adjusting his glasses.</p><br><p>"Yeah... You look impressive." Silvana replied.</p><br><br><p>"I'm not talking to you. Stay behind your Phantom and be quiet, you don't need to annoy me." Magnus uttered through gritted teeth. It seemed he was the type of person who could lose his temper quickly, all it took was a single spark.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Immediately, electric shocks ran through Adam's body, and a longhorn appeared on his head. His aura grew several times larger, making Nessa forget how to breathe.</p><br><p>"Hey, you shouldn't talk to my Operator like that. If she's wrong about something, I'll deal with her, but only me, not some freak in an old coat." Adam said menacingly, while his hair lifted, turning bright blue with electricity.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, though Magnus was an ordinary man, he stood confidently on his feet with a calm face. His breathing was measured and normal.</p><br><p>'Oh, is this an effect of some of his development, or is it just his spirit power? That's curious...' Adam pondered, waiting for the situation to develop.</p><br><p>Magnus had to say something.</p><br><p>Silvana, standing behind Adam, gasped, starting to get nervous. She knew that Magnus Zephyr was the best option for Adam's treatment, yet that option was now in jeopardy.</p><br><p>Magnus must surely be furious - so thought Silvana as she turned to Magnus, and her eyes went wide.</p><br><p>Abruptly, Magnus smiled kindly, it seemed that even the color of his skin became warmer, and his eyes didn't look as dangerous as before. It was as if he had swapped his black side for a white one.</p><br><p>"Good. That kind of drive and strength I respect. Now I see how you defeated Thunder Demon. Sorry, I didn't watch the video, only heard it, but now I regret it. I'll have to find the time." Magnus uttered, rubbing his chin with a slight smile.</p><br><br><p>A final electric shock flickered across Adam's eyes as he canceled the ability.</p><br><p>"In that case, shall we get started? You said this experiment had something to do with my treatment. So, I'd like to understand exactly how you intend to cure me. Why your way is dangerous, fast, and superior to the best technology in the department." Adam said seriously.</p><br><p>Magnus didn't answer anything, instead, he turned to Nessa and with a kind smile on his face said:</p><br><p>"Would you be so kind as to make us some tea and get us some cookies, chocolate ones?"</p><br><p>"Got it!" Nessa quickly replied before running into the kitchen. Even though Magnus seemed like the kindest person right now, she didn't dare disappoint him.</p><br><p>Then, Magnus turned to Adam and put his palms together saying:</p><br><p>"Don't worry. As soon as my assistant makes us some tea, I'll tell you all about it, but... Before I do, I want to warn you about something." Magnus narrowed his eyes before stepping closer to Adam.</p><br><p>Then, it seemed to Silvana that a demon from the netherworld appeared in front of Adam, and Magnus's emotions again changed drastically, making him eerily frightened.</p><br><p>"Given the circumstances, I hope you don't disappoint me. Forcing people to act out of fear is completely ineffective, I need volunteers, and you're the perfect match. If you refuse, I will make your life a living hell!"</p><br><p>Magnus's voice was threatening enough to make Silvana shudder in fear.</p><br><p>"But, you're threatening me right now. Doesn't that mean I'll get scared, and it won't be something you want?" Adam asked with a calm look, Magnus's show did not affect him.</p><br><p>"Oh... You're right!" Magnus quickly exclaimed in a slightly surprised voice as if he had solved a riddle, then he frowned, pondering something, "Why didn't anyone tell me about this? It's really illogical..."</p><br><p>'What the fuck is going on here...?' Silvana internally muttered, completely puzzled.</p><br><p>Magnus Zephyr had turned out to be a weirdo even to her, though she had learned a bit about him before meeting him, as much as she could.</p><br><br><p>Ten minutes later, all four of them were sitting around the table eating cookies. Well, only Magnus and Zephyr were doing that, Nessa and Silvana hadn't touched the sweets.</p><br><p>"Anyway, I'll get right to the point. Curing your arm using my method is very simple." Magnus said, shoving a cookie into his mouth.</p><br><p>"What do I have to do? Find some rare monster? Drink some of your weird 'potions'?" Adam asked with a wave of his hand.</p><br><p>Magnus smiled slightly as he swung his hand carelessly.</p><br><p>"Nah, it's much simpler than that."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"You have to eat the monster."</p>
