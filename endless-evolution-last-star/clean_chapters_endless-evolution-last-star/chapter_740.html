            <br><p>The rippling of water always had a calming effect on humans and monsters alike. However, the river Adam was looking at now only caused him anxiety to grow from the depths.</p><br><p>But, though the bloody river was unusual and eerie, what was really the problem was the multitude of silhouettes working toward a common goal.</p><br><p>Glancing around the unknown territory, Adam took a few steps back to contact Silvana, his voice quiet so no one would hear him, at least he hoped so:</p><br><p>'Hey... I take it I've finally arrived at my destination. I can sense it by how active the First Wall has become, but... where the hell am I?'</p><br><p>However, there was no reply, though Adam could hear Silvana's breathing, a little nervous.</p><br><p>'Adam, I'm afraid I don't know where you are. This place isn't in any record of Fortress of the Lone Serpents, as well as I can't find any similar places, given our situation.'</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Silvana continued:</p><br><p>'I didn't know anything about that strange gate as well as this place, but I can definitely help you with the monsters.'</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, he doubted he missed anything important about this location since the effects of the crimson mist were known to him. The monsters were the bigger problem.</p><br><p>But... soon they both got the answer to their question:</p><br><p>[This place... is called the Temple of the Fallen Serpent.]</p><br><p>Lone Blaze's voice was heard by both Adam and Silvana. This was the first time for Silvana, as it took Lone Blaze a while to realize that Evolution Tree was connected with Evolution Seed.</p><br><p>'What? How do you know that?' Adam whispered, 'Not even Silvana has that information, no one does! Apparently, I was the first to find it!'</p><br><p>Explore more at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>[Because I can feel it, Adam, I didn't come up with the name... it's been in the energy for a long time, in the wheezes and roars of the monsters that have long created their domain right under my fortress... That's what they call this place, that's what the energy says.]</p><br><p>Adam blinked several times. Now, Lone Blaze was acting very much like the Evolution Tree, its words were devoid of direct answers, full of mystery, but something became clear to Adam.</p><br><p>'I see... Silvana, when the Phantoms find new territories who comes up with the titles? I mean, monsters can't really talk, is there any way to figure it out by energy alone?'</p><br><p>With some uncertainty, Silvana was about to say something, but Lone Blaze beat her to it, that voice was harsh and stern:</p><br><p>[Adam... You can enjoy the discoverer's experience later. There's not much time left, you must hurry.]</p><br><p>Silvana accepted Lone Blaze's words, afraid to interfere with them, but Adam had a different opinion on the matter. He frowned heavily, looking at the sun seal on his chest.</p><br><br><p>His irritated whisper, escaped his throat, quiet but rough.</p><br><p>'You keep saying you're afraid of something, that we don't have much time, then why haven't you done anything in all this time? Did you just close the third statue gate and wait for a miracle?'</p><br><p>Lone Blaze was silent, Adam asked a question that Lone Blaze didn't want to answer, but it had no other choice:</p><br><p>[Because I couldn't do it... None of my three strongest monsters were capable of handling the threat in Temple of the Fallen Serpent... at least two of them.]</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Lone Blaze added:</p><br><p>[I didn't want to run away from my own domain, so... I'm lucky you showed up, in a way. Adam, we made the Pact, you have your part, so you have to help me.]</p><br><br><p>[Though I'm not allowed to say it, I'll give you a hint...].</p><br><p>Adam's eyebrow rose upwards, his eyes filled with genuine curiosity.</p><br><p>[The Evolution Tree forbids me from telling you what happens after the Pact is complete for a reason. What you'll get if you succeed...]</p><br><p>Then, Lona Blaze fell silent without saying anything else.</p><br><p>"I see... Well, you're right about something, first the work then everything else."</p><br><p>With those words, Adam walked out to the edge of the slope lowering his gaze downward. He wanted to get a good look at his future opponents since the serpent seal was near the beginning of the river.</p><br><p>If he wanted to reach the temple, he needed to walk along the riverbank, towards the bright lights shining in the distance.</p><br><p>His blue, focused eyes reflected two long objects moving quickly toward him like the raptorial legs of a praying mantis.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils went wide as he abruptly put the needle out in front of him trying to defend himself from the sudden attack.</p><br><br><p>The sharp crimson tips of the legs curved in two places, long and sturdy and covered in something like chitin, pressed harder against him, trying to break the silver needle.</p><br><p>Realizing he couldn't see his opponent, Adam turned back around, for a moment his face frozen in horror.</p><br><p>A massive creature with four long legs, two of which were attacking him now, was hanging from the ceiling. It seemed it had been here back when the Carnage Jaws attacked Adam, but it was waiting for its moment, taking its time like a true predator.</p><br><p>The monster's body was elongated and rather skinny, but it was large, about five meters long, and two and a half high. Bright red flesh covered most of it, but from the side of the belly protruded a few ribs, its spine was strongly curved, pulling its sharp edges of flesh over the top.</p><br><p>The monster's head was elongated and narrow like an underwater raptor's, it possessed only two small all-black eyes, calmly watching Adam.</p><br><p>It was the Thirst Redeemer, the Mid Yellow monster, significantly above the medium stage.</p><br><p>The Thirst Redeemer had no hatred or anger towards Adam, it was calm and merciless, its behavior was similar to insects who killed because they had to.</p><br><br><p>The flames grew brighter, burning the Thirst Redeemer's front legs, the monster quickly brought the legs back to itself before leaping forward.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes darted to the side, following the Thirst Redeemer who was now hanging from the ceiling, just above the raging river of blood.</p><br><p>Then, the Thirst Redeemer slowly opened its ghastly jaw, a multitude of dark tentacles emerging from the curved gaps, releasing thick red smoke.</p>
