            <br><p>After a while, Alan succeeded - if anyone could influence Katrin it was him. She quickly wiped away her tears so no one would see it and turned her head to the side.</p><br><p>Her reddened eyes met with Viron's calm and Gnash's serious ones. They understood what happened to her, but this was not the time or place to discuss it.</p><br><p>"Fine, I'm going back."</p><br><p>With a whisper filled with sorrow, Katrin stepped to the side, disappearing in a dark flash. After a few quiet leaps, she found herself outside the gate, then she ascended the fortress, meeting the two strongest Phantoms after her.</p><br><p>Viron started first:</p><br><p>"Looks like our opponent was stronger than we anticipated, isn't it?"</p><br><p>Unlike the Gnash, who had met Katrin, he did not turn around, continuing to watch as the Blind Sinner and the Dormant Lord fought.</p><br><p>For weaker creatures, their fight was a treasure in itself, just by watching their movements closely, one could learn a lot.</p><br><p>There was no need to be a martial artist or an experienced warrior. If one eats food without any spices all his life and then tries something trivial, just a salted dish, then a whole new world opens up, and that was a similar scenario here.</p><br><p>But, for those who were close to that level, it was a glimpse into the future. Sure, it was important to the Phantoms to have the Blind Sinner win, but no one could predict that.</p><br><br><p>Katrin walked over and leaned against the wall, peering over her shoulder at the fight.</p><br><p>"What are we going to do?"</p><br><p>Viron shrugged slightly, his green eyes moving slowly for fear of missing even one clash of monsters.</p><br><p>"I don't know. We don't really have many options. You lost, but we're lucky the Blind Sinner showed up."</p><br><p>His words recoiled with a bright pain in Katrin's heart, but she didn't say anything. She realized that Viron wasn't trying to humiliate her, he was simply listing the course of events and their options.</p><br><p>"It's unknown why the first Phantom that came here didn't finish off the Blind Commander, but it played to our advantage. Now we not only have time to think of a plan but also the opportunity to kill the Dormant Lord."</p><br><p>Then, Katrin and Gnash turned in his direction with wide-eyed stares. After Katrin's defeat, all the Phantoms became convinced that the Dormant Lord was an invincible opponent, but Viron's voice was completely serious.</p><br><p>"What? How are you going to do that?" Gnash blinked several times.</p><br><p>"It's simple. It's unlikely that another monster of equal strength to these two will appear here, the chances of that happening are simply negligible. Thus, the Blind Sinner and the Dormant Lord will fight until one of them loses."</p><br><p>Viron pointed at the Dormant Lord:</p><br><p>"If he wins, he'll be exhausted and injured. In that case, the three of us with the help of the other squad commanders can finish him off, even if someone has to die to do so. I think it's obvious that we'll do the same if the Blind Sinner wins."</p><br><br><p>Gnash rubbed her chin thoughtfully, nodding a few times with a focused look.</p><br><p>"Yeah, that could work. Hah, Viron maybe you should use your strategic mind earlier. You're pretty good at it."</p><br><p>In response to her praise, Viron didn't show any emotion, keeping a cold expression.</p><br><p>"Don't joke like that, this is the easiest tactic we can resort to, nothing to praise here, but... we have to prepare."</p><br><p>Katrin and Gnash looked at each other. Viron had already told them his plan, simple but workable and most importantly with a high chance of success.</p><br><p>"You..." Viron pointed at Katrin, "Despite recent events, you are still the strongest Phantom we have. You're injured and exhausted, you need to rest. All free supports should help you recover, you should be close to your peak when it's time for round two."</p><br><p>Then, he directed his gaze to Gnash.</p><br><p>"You and I have two threats to dispose of."</p><br><p>Gnash tilted her head in confusion.</p><br><br><p>Viron jerked his head toward the Grim Warro and the Silent Droao, two monsters that were second in power only to the Dormant Lord and the Blind Sinner still standing idle.</p><br><p>True, their favorite was the Dormant Lord, but they couldn't help him. The shockwaves from their skirmishes, frost energy, and recoil would simply destroy them before they could even contribute to the outcome of the battle.</p><br><p>"We have to kill them. If the Blind Sinner loses, they will rush to the aid of the Dormant Lord, a 3 vs 1 fight will turn 3 vs 3, this is not favorable for us."</p><br><p>Gnash only nodded silently in response, clutching her staff tighter. They decided who would fight whom some time ago, but now they must hurry.</p><br><br><p>Crunching his neck, shaking his head from side to side, Viron stretched his fingers, walking away from his sight spot.</p><br><p>Walking beside Gnash, he placed a hand on her shoulder, squeezing it tightly.</p><br><p>"Come, our time has come. I realize it would be preferable to fight them in the fortress, but until the main battle is over, no one will enter the fortress, but... then it will be too late."</p><br><p>Gnash snorted, dropping his hand with a light wave.</p><br><p>"Sure, you don't need to explain every detail to me. After all, you and I are equals, don't forget that."</p><br><p>A bitter smile appeared on Viron's face.</p><br><p>"Hah, whatever you say. Meet me at the gate in three minutes. Your and my supports should be there, we should get as much amplification as our bodies can handle."</p><br><p>Gnash was about to say something, but Viron beat her to it, taking the first step on the stairs.</p><br><p>"We quickly kill the Grim Warro and the Silent Droao, then return to the fortress, nothing else, understood?"</p><br><p>Gnash's eyebrow twitched. It annoyed her that he was bossing her around, but he was saying all the right things, she couldn't argue with him.</p><br><p>"Yeah... just shut up already Mr. Seriousness."</p><br><p>Watching the two of them Katrin smiled slightly, a few minutes ago she was practically dead inside, but she was slowly getting better.</p><br><p>'Hah... Well, after all, with Adam there were always allies too, weren't there? Working as a team is also a sign of strength...'</p>
