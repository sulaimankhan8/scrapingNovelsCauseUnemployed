            <br><p>Bladeclaw Beast, like any regenerative monster, was able to heal absolutely any wound, there were really no limits.</p><br><p>If someone ripped Adam's heart out of his chest, he would die within seconds, however, for Bladeclaw Beast, the loss of such an important organ was not a problem.</p><br><p>However, this did not mean that Bladeclaw Beast was invincible, no, regenerative monsters had their weaknesses. Due to their body structure, they all had feeble defenses, as one could not regenerate stone or iron armor as easily as pure flesh.</p><br><p>Regenerative monsters also rarely had any energy abilities. While Thunder Demon could cause destruction comparable to the most powerful explosions, Bladeclaw Beast mostly had only physical attacks in his arsenal.</p><br><p>Sure, there were exceptions to every rule, but a monster couldn't have great destructive power, defense, speed, and an incredible regeneration rate. </p><br><p>Moreover, even regeneration wasn't infinite. Any regenerative monster had a certain amount of energy they spent on regeneration. Once they ran out of energy, regeneration would become impossible, and they would die of exhaustion.</p><br><p>Also, it was known that the only way to kill a regenerative monster was to destroy it with one powerful attack. In fact, that wasn't exactly the case.</p><br><p>The power of the attack was not as important as the fact that the monster died faster than it regenerated. Given the weak defense of the regenerative monsters, it was not uncommon for them to be killed in this manner.</p><br><p>Bladeclaw Beast was a Top-7, intelligent, and dangerous monster, which was why he left his heart in Adam's hand. After all, regenerative monsters took different amounts of energy to regenerate different wounds.</p><br><p>Growing a new heart - the central organ - in a few seconds was dozens of times more expensive than simply filling the hole from Adam's attack with pieces of flesh.</p><br><p>Sure, like Magnus said, Bladeclaw Beast was weaker without a heart, but that wasn't the problem. Bladeclaw Beast just lowered his defense even more, compensating for the loss of his heart in a way that didn't affect his other parameters.</p><br><p>It might have seemed like a big mistake, after all, defense was necessary in any fight. Well... it wasn't.</p><br><p>What difference did it make if the defense was high or low, if either way, Adam's claws would tear through it like a piece of paper?</p><br><br><p>Adam turned around, slowly heading towards the table. He turned his back to Bladeclaw Beast, which was dangerous, but Adam wasn't worried that the monster could hurt him.</p><br><p>He placed Bladeclaw Beast's heart on the plate, watching it beat for a while.</p><br><p>"Hey, so regenerative monsters work in such a way that every time they lose an organ, they'll get weaker?" Adam asked without turning around.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, more to the point, don't forget, regenerative monsters don't create something new, they only regenerate to their original state. If Bladeclaw Beast wanted to regenerate his organ, he'd have to blow it up, then create a new one. That would be a double waste of energy." Magnus explained.</p><br><p>"I see... They do have a lot of limitations, however, otherwise they would be invincible." Adam sighed as his eyes grew deeper.</p><br><p>Magnus was talking about how regenerative monsters as well as Bladeclaw Beast, couldn't grow ten hearts if necessary. Bladeclaw Beast had one heart, which meant that if he lost it, he could only regenerate one heart at most.</p><br><p>The same applies to other organs and limbs.</p><br><p>If one cut off Bladeclaw Beast's paw and left it aside, Bladeclaw Beast would have to remotely destroy his paw to regenerate it. He couldn't grow a new paw while the same paw was still intact, but far away from his body.</p><br><p>Now, Bladeclaw Beast's decision not to regenerate the heart made even more sense, for he not only saved energy by not regenerating the heart but also not wasting even more energy to remotely destroy it in Adam's hand.</p><br><p>"Hah, so with each organ he loses, he'll be weaker, and if he decides to regenerate them, he'll lose a lot of energy. That's curious." Adam chuckled evilly, he seemed to have figured out a suitable way for him to fight Bladeclaw Beast.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam could use his Artifact Trait - One-horned Disaster, but he wasn't sure he had enough firepower to kill Bladeclaw Beast in one attack. Moreover, if Bladeclaw Beast decided to explode his heart in the end, Adam could find himself in a difficult situation.</p><br><br><p>Bladeclaw Beast's patience came to an end as his outgrowths headed towards Adam at high speed.</p><br><p>Electric shocks went through Adam's eyes as his head jerked several times in different directions, allowing the sharp tips to fly next to his neck and embed deeply into the wall.</p><br><p>"Hey, stop showing off. I don't feel like wasting time and resources repairing walls at all." Magnus said playfully. Naturally, he didn't care about the walls, but he wanted to see the results of his method in Adam's case as soon as possible.</p><br><p>"Well, I guess I'll agree." Adam nodded before turning around sharply, cutting the four outgrowths into small pieces.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the severed pieces exploded, covering everything around them in blood, only to return to Bladeclaw Beast and recover. A bit of blood remained on the ground, in a way, it was an indication of the energy spent by Bladeclaw Beast on this regeneration.</p><br><p>"His organs are arranged like in a hologram, right?" Adam asked confidently, stepping forward.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, you're thinking in the right direction. That hologram is of this particular Bladeclaw Beast, not their species."</p><br><p>Adam nodded as his eyes shone brightly, and a lightning horn appeared on the left side of his head.</p><br><p>The next thing Silvana saw, watching the fight closely, was Adam disappearing, ending up behind Bladeclaw Beast.</p><br><p>Pieces of flesh flew off to the sides, as Bladeclaw Beast's body was torn in two.</p><br><br><p>Ropes of flesh quickly emerged from the torn body parts, stitching them together like threads, but... something Bladeclaw Beast decided not to regenerate...</p><br><br><p>Crimson droplets dripped from Adam's silver claws, from two strange organs thrust onto the gauntlet's sharp tips.</p><br><p>The organs of monsters and humans differed, both in appearance, function, and names, but roughly speaking, Adam had just robbed Bladeclaw Beast of a kidney and a liver. The humans had those organs in approximately the same place Adam had attacked.</p><br><p>"Well, what would you rather lose this time?" Adam said with a wave of his hand and tossed the two organs aside into the corner of the room like useless trash.</p><br><p>Bladeclaw Beast's four eyes narrowed, then two of them closed, disappearing in clots of flesh and vanishing forever. The same thing happened to two of the four outgrowths on the monster's broad back.</p><br><p>"I see... I don't know what you're counting on, but you can't beat me this way." Adam said seriously before attacking once more, tearing Bladeclaw Beast apart, with no resistance from the monster.</p><br><p>Magnus chuckled evilly, enjoying the show.</p><br><p>"Looks like Adam will win soon." Silvana said with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>"Don't jump to conclusions." Nessa said sternly.</p><br><p>"Agh?" Silvana was puzzled.</p><br><p>Magnus glanced at her and waved his hand.</p><br><p>"You're both right. Adam will definitely eventually exhaust Bladeclaw Beast, but... the real battle will begin when Adam eats his heart. That's when everything will be determined."</p>
