            <br><p>In a few quick leaps across the roofs of the damaged buildings, Risha and Vorx reached the main gate.</p><br><p>It was one of the entrances to the castle, the main one, but it only led to the first floor. This was where Kreyna was, all the serpents knew it, because this was where she brought them to administer punishment or to give them their next assignment.</p><br><p>Arnoth had little involvement in the running of the captured lands. He spent all his time on the second floor, in the throne room, sitting on his throne and waiting for the time to change. Moreover, Kreyna was doing an excellent job at her duties.</p><br><p>That was the reason why Adam and Heret stopped in front of the gate, waiting for Risha and Vorx to arrive.</p><br><p>Grita and Torz had their tasks. They were leading the resistance, and the plan was to approach the castle when Risha and Vorx's battle against Kreyna was coming to an end.</p><br><br><p>With a slight shudder, Risha and Vorx simultaneously landed running up to Adam and Heret who were waiting for them amongst four massive corpses.</p><br><p>'Damn, they killed them here...' Risha gulped, looking at the blood spilling from beneath the Light Guardian's great bodies.</p><br><p>Heret waved his hand, his expression serious. "You're finally here. Are you ready? She's already waiting for you..."</p><br><p>Turning toward the gate, Vorx nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yeah, I can feel her aura. I'm sure she'll be happy to see who will fight against her. Hahaha!"</p><br><p>Unlike the cheerful Vorx, who was ready to fight with a smile on his face, Risha grew wary.</p><br><p>"This Kreyna... She's outside the gate now?" she glanced at Heret.</p><br><p>"Correct. You may not fear stealth attacks, it's not her style. She will fight against you, with full confidence that she can win and make you suffer."</p><br><br><p>Heret patted her shoulder. "Don't give her that feeling. Her death is not only the Serpent Folk's path to freedom but also your opportunity to become stronger. This is the moment that will decide everything. This was the moment you've been waiting for, so... Don't you dare screw this up!"</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Risha's body, yet a slight smile showed her intentions.</p><br><p>"Don't worry." She gripped her axe tightly, slinging the weapon onto her shoulder. "You have told me much about this sadistic woman, I will make her suffer! Not just because I'm your ally, but because I hate arrogant bitches like her!"</p><br><br><br><p>Then, he looked at Adam, gesturing toward the gate.</p><br><p>"Of course, I'll get it done now," he said with a wave of his hand. "Risha, defeat Kreyna quickly and head straight to the throne room. I'm sure it will be a battle not to be missed."</p><br><p>"Pffft!" she snorted. "You don't have to worry about me! I'll get it all done. If I were you, I'd think about how to defeat Arnoth, he's much stronger than Kreyna."</p><br><p>Dark laughter erupted from Adam.</p><br><p>"Hah, yeah, but I'm stronger than you."</p><br><p>Risha puffed up her cheeks, but her expression quickly changed when the first needle appeared in Adam's right hand, great and dangerous, exuding black streams of energy.</p><br><p>No one could stop Adam. The others only took a step back so as not to accidentally get hit by the shockwave.</p><br><p>"By the way... I haven't used infusive energy control on my new ability yet, have I? Hah, I can expend some energy. It will recover before the fight against Arnoth."</p><br><p>Then, Adam raised the needle as energy filled the broad weapon.</p><br><p>Darkness condensed at the lower blade, shivering actively.</p><br><p>With a cold stare, Adam gripped his first needle tightly with both hands as the long hilt suggested.</p><br><p>The wind currents passing nearby accelerated, gathering around his needle in a quick whirlwind, scattering small stones further and further away from the epicenter.</p><br><p>"Well, let's see how strong this gate is," Adam wheezed.</p><br><p>With the next step, Adam brought the needle down to the ground.</p><br><p>The blade of darkness flew forward, carrying a destructive wave behind it. The ground slashed, and the heavy golden gate shattered into fragments, unable to resist Adam's power for even a moment.</p><br><p>The white marble of the castle's first floor was split in two, cracks covering the spacious floor, shattering nearby columns, and brightly glowing crystals.</p><br><p>The silhouette standing behind, a shadow amidst the light, bounced aside.</p><br><p>Not even Kreyna dared to block Adam's attack directly.</p><br><p>A slight smile appeared on Heret's face as he swept past Adam, touching his shoulder. Then, their frames shuddered as they disappeared like ghosts moving toward the fallen ring.</p><br><p>One part of the ring was broken, buried in the ground, but the other part was still floating on the castle grounds. This was their way to the western bridge, directly connected to the ring and leading to the throne room.</p><br><p>This route would take them some time, not too much, but enough for the results of the first important battle to be clear.</p><br><p>Risha and Vorx glanced around.</p><br><p>Adam's attack frightened everyone, the serpents, and the Light Legion. Now, only they were here, in front of the gate, and Kreyna was in no hurry to come out to meet them.</p><br><p>She stood in the distance, amidst a cloud of dust, next to the wide slash.</p><br><p>"Let's go," Vorx nodded as his eyes lit up with bright flames. "We have to do this. Just like we agreed. I'll take most of the blows first, then you take the lead and try to open the fourth gates."</p><br><br><p>Risha stepped forward using several abilities. Mirrored high boots appeared on her feet, a red aura ran through her body, a skull bracelet appeared on her wrist, and crimson claws soared over her hand.</p><br><p>If she couldn't stand up to an S5 monster, not even the strongest one, it was unlikely that she would ever be like her big brother.</p><br><p>As soon as Vorx and Risha crossed the gate border, they were greeted by a menacing aura, the demon glaring down at them from above with its devious smirk.</p><br><br><p>Kreyna whispered, releasing her aura at full power.</p><br><p>"I was hoping to fight that guy, but... I'll have to strangle two pathetic rats first. Show me what you can do!"</p>
