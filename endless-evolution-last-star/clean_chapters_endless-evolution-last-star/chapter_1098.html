            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1098: Black Tower (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>A new level and new abilities.</p><br><p>This wasn’t the first time Adam went through this process, but it was the first time Silvana got something special for herself.</p><br><p>Following Wilfred, Adam flexed his shoulder, with no trace left of the previous deep wound. He had been healed many times by other Phantoms or essences, so he knew what good healing looked like, and what Silvana did was-</p><br><p>“Perfect!” Adam exclaimed, clenching his fist tightly. “Your ability not only healed my wound but also restored some of my energy! I feel as good as I did before the fight!”</p><br><p>Silvana, who was walking beside him, smiled faintly.</p><br><p>“I’m glad you liked it, but…” she stumped. “That was my best. If you need my help, I can only heal one of your wounds and take another one upon myself through Pain Transition in a critical situation.”</p><br><p>After just one use, bags appeared under her eyes. She wasn’t exhausted, but it was clear that, unlike Adam, who could use many abilities without fatigue, her abilities were severely limited.</p><br><p>“Hah, don’t worry about it, it’s more than enough. Besides, it’s not the only thing waiting for us, right?”</p><br><p>Silvana nodded weakly. She understood what Adam was talking about. The energy of the First Star covered Adam’s Foundation Artifact, and the other part was with her, creating the next ability for her.</p><br><p>Did Silvana have her own Evolution Tree where her abilities could be stored?</p><br><br><p>All her powers were in Adam’s Evolution Tree, or more precisely, directly in the Evolution Vein, because it was originally her Evolution Sprout.</p><br><br><p>Gradually, the three of them reached the platform ready to send them from one of the lowest floors of the Cave Grid to the very top.</p><br><p>“Finally.” Wilfred sighed heavily. “Get in quickly. First, we’ll go to the store, and then straight to my tower.”</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head in confusion. “Your tower?”</p><br><p>“The black one. The Tower of the Black Swan. Or do you think this tower could belong to someone else?”</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana exchanged glances. It was just a little unexpected for them.</p><br><p>Adam had originally gone to the Cave Grid to meet with the Black Swan members. In the end, he was returning to the Lower Ring with their leader, the one he was originally looking for.</p><br><p>With a slight crack, the platform rose, moving upward at tremendous speed.</p><br><p>Soon, they were at the zero level, leaving the chamber along with dozens of other Phantoms. Some were entering to get to the Cave Grid, while others were returning after heavy fighting, some wounded and some happy with their new victories.</p><br><p>However, when they realized that Wilfred himself was passing by, their eyes immediately turned in his direction.</p><br><p>Phantoms like him rarely went hunting. They had more important things to do, which usually took place at the Dark Shore. This was true for all Second Rank Phantoms, especially those like Wilfred, because, unlike the heads of the Twelve Branches, he could fight on equal terms against True Lords such as Saegar and Kenward.</p><br><p>“Mr. Wilfred, you’re quite popular…” Silvana muttered, glancing around.</p><br><p>Wilfred shrugged. “Do you think that’s good news? You know, when you try to do something ordinary as a normal person, like buying cigarettes at a store, it turns into a real problem.”</p><br><p>True, whether Wilfred wanted it or not, but every person and Phantom at the Lower Ring knew who he was. He had only three choices: either avoid publicity, endure it, or disguise himself, as Damien often did.</p><br><br><p>As Wilfred said, they immediately went to the nearest store, where he bought three identical packs of cigarettes in black packaging with a red line.</p><br><p>Without leaving the store, Wilfred lit his first cigarette under the shocked gaze of the cashier.</p><br><p>This was not a special store where influential people like him secretly shopped. No, it was a very ordinary store where people bought chocolate ice cream and chips at a discount.</p><br><br><p>Exhaling the first cloud of smoke, Wilfred sighed with relief. From the outside, it seemed that this one sigh made him look five years younger.</p><br><p>“Alright, now I’m ready. Let’s go, Adam. We have a long conversation ahead of us. Not only about Aiden Henk but also about the overall situation in which the Citadel and our world find themselves. You’re already a K4-Phantom, so… you have the right to know.”</p><br><p>Silvana turned to him.</p><br><p>“I thought that these things were usually handled by people from the government or high-ranking military officials like Douglas.”</p><br><p>Wilfred smiled bitterly. “Douglas? Hah, yeah, that old man likes to look for talent among the younger generation. Usually, we all dump this headache on the government, but this is a special case. Or would you prefer that I send you to Douglas and only then have a talk?”</p><br><p>Without a doubt, Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>“No, let’s do it. It doesn’t matter who I learn new secrets from, the most important thing is that the secret finally becomes clear.”</p><br><p>Learning the secrets of the Citadel and their world was one of Adam’s goals that should have led him straight to how Queen Elisa appeared and what this practically dead but great woman was doing.</p><br><p>Wilfred grinned as he nodded his head and left the store.</p><br><p>“In that case, follow me. Others disagree, but I believe that the top of the black tower offers the best view in the entire Lower Ring!”</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana exchanged glances, slight smiles covering their faces.</p><br><p>‘Well, the Dark Shore was an unexpected leap forward. It’s not what I expected when I set out on the hunt, but I have no regrets.’</p><br><p>All Adam could hope for was that the secrets of the Citadel and the world that Wilfred was going to talk about weren’t so terrible.</p><br><p>He wanted to continue onward, deep down, hoping to meet an enemy with greatness comparable to Arnoth and the Kyros, the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>Thus, Adam and Silvana followed Wilfred, soon finding themselves in front of the north tower, one of four, where they were met by the Black Swan members.</p>
