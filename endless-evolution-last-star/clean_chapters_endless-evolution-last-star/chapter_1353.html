            <h4>Chapter 1353: Soaring Fragments</h4><br><p>Adam descended into the White Spire for his second trial. Only if he passed all the trials would he be able to assemble the mysterious seal from the dark fragments.
</p><br><p>Mona, as the host of the White Spire, was his guide in this majestic place, but despite this, a stranger who had not been here for even an hour was able to put her in a stressful position.
</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..." Mona breathed heavily, collapsing with both hands on the floor, surrounded by white emptiness.
</p><br><p>It wasn’t Adam’s aura and his intense gaze that weighed on her with surprising force, but his words.
</p><br><p>"SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! What was that all about?!" Mona exclaimed, punching the void. "What does he care about what’s going on here?"
</p><br><p>After a few moments, she looked up at several fragments floating above the void. They had been destroyed hundreds of years ago, becoming debris floating in the void, yet still possessing a great power that made Mona want to kneel in awe.
</p><br><p>This chamber was the only place where Mona was hidden from Bertrada’s gaze, only she had access here, as a long-time and loyal servant of the White Spire, but what did that matter now?
</p><br><p>"Tsk..." Mona bit her lip until it bled. "What was he trying to do? This Phantom is too young to understand how the world works! What choice did I have but to obey my new master?!"
</p><br><p>Then, Mona stared at the soaring fragments and stepped forward, uncertain, in short steps.
</p><br><p>"Master... Even if you can’t be brought back, I will always remember your battle and sacrifice... After all, even now, your past is my strength and a part of my present..."
</p><br><p>For a moment, she thought of Adam as a bitter smile covered her face.
</p><br><p>"If it weren’t for you, that arrogant Phantom wouldn’t have been able to pass the trials. Something tells me that he will be able to reach the top even if he is at the bottom right now."
</p><br><br><p>At the same time, the platform stopped as Adam found himself in the area of the second trial.
</p><br><p>Unlike the first trial, where there was nothing but a hundred gargoyles and a destroyed bridge, here Adam was greeted by a real arena, or rather a full-fledged battlefield.
</p><br><p>The trees, hills, stone peaks, and ruins covered the expanse before him, and all he had to do to get to the starting point of the arena was to get off the platform.
</p><br><p>In the distance, Adam immediately saw his opponent - a massive monster, a Crystal Golem, over ten meters tall. Its body was not just solid white stone, but filled with bright crystals carrying dense energy.
</p><br><p>The Crystal Golem’s eyes shone brightly like lights as he stared at Adam with a slight frown, waiting for his contender to finally make his move so they could begin the trial.
</p><br><p>"Damn, it’s like..." Adam muttered, remembering one of his first serious opponents - Prime Stone Goliath.
</p><br><p>Sure, it wasn’t the most powerful monster in the world, but it was the one that started Adam’s risky journey. If he hadn’t been lucky or had slowed down even for a few seconds that day, he would have died right there, among many other Phantoms who weren’t strong enough to deal with the Prime Stone Goliath.
</p><br><p>The Crystal Golem was similar in body composition, but significantly stronger - there was no comparison.
</p><br><p>But the Crystal Golem wasn’t the only thing Adam had to worry about.
</p><br><p>"What’s that..." He looked around.
</p><br><p>Around the perimeter of the arena stood tall pillars that were even higher than his current level, and he had to descend much lower.
</p><br><p>On each pillar stood a huge glass cannon, next to which stood several small creatures with red or gray skin, demonic wings, and sly grins like children ready to do mischief.
</p><br><p>The imps were ready to light the cannons to fire at Adam, but they, like the Crystal Golem, had to wait until he descended to the starting spot.
</p><br><p>"What do you think?" Adam asked as a gust of wind blew past him, ruffling his hair.
</p><br><p>Silvana appeared on his right as she nodded thoughtfully.
</p><br><p>"The difficulty level has definitely increased. At the first trial, you essentially had only one opponent. The ordinary gargoyles were unable to harm you. Here, everything is different. Moreover, we don’t see a way out of this trial."
</p><br><p>Adam sighed as he glanced back over his shoulder. "Yeah... I got to the gate and thought I’d go up, but I ended up here. I don’t see any gates or elevators, but there must be a way through somewhere, right?"
</p><br><p>Silvana raised her head in an attempt to see something unusual, and to her surprise, she found something - a blue sky and slowly floating clouds.
</p><br><p>Soon, Adam noticed it.
</p><br><p>"Hah, it’s strange, isn’t it? Before, there was only white emptiness, but now we at least have a sky!"
</p><br><p>"Yes... But I don’t see any hidden passageway there. It seems like this is just how the trial looks, nothing more. But..." Her eyes turned downward, toward the sparse ruins among the hills and forest. "Maybe you’ll find something in the arena."
</p><br><p>Adam shrugged and was about to step forward, but Silvana stopped him at the last moment.
</p><br><p>"Is something wrong?" He tilted his head in confusion.
</p><br><p>"Be careful," Silvana said with a stern face. "I don’t see the wing sign on this golem’s chest. Unlike that gargoyle, this guard hasn’t received his reinforcement yet."
</p><br><p>"Sure, what’s more, I’ve had a little time to prepare now. I think I know what to expect from this trial."
</p><br><p>Then, he jumped down as the gate behind him immediately closed and the platform headed upward, indicating that he would have to continue his ascent via another route. That is, if he could survive this trial.
</p><br><br><p>Adam fell onto a stone slab covered with roots coming from tall trees in the distance.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, the previously calm Crystal Golem grinned as a massive rock full of crystals appeared out of the void in front of him.
</p><br><p>Without effort, the Crystal Golem crushed the rock into several sharp shards, ready to throw them directly at Adam.
</p><br><p>"Go ahead, I’m ready." Adam grinned as unusually colored electric discharges flashed across his eyes.</p>
