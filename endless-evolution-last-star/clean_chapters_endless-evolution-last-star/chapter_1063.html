            <h4>Chapter 1063: Eye from afar</h4><br><p>To prepare trial, Saegar needed some time. He sent Valdris to this task.
</p><br><p>He wasn’t going to force any of his men to participate in a trial where they risked dying at the hands of the Phantom. But Saegar knew that there would be even more than twenty willing participants.
</p><br><p>For the Red Threat Level monster to obtain the Twilight Crystal was a sure way to evolve. No matter what stage the monster was at, the energy was too much and it was ancient, straight from the First Star.
</p><br><p>Therefore, Valdris would have to make a small selection to get the twenty strongest monsters of the Red Threat Level. Naturally, he, as well as everyone else, did not want to let Adam get the Twilight Crystal.
</p><br><p>It wouldn’t take Valdris much time.
</p><br><p>He soared in front of a group of over a hundred wing monsters as his aura gradually became more and more powerful.
</p><br><p>Several monsters collapsed to the ground at once, others tried to hold on, but eventually, their knees hit the earth and their eyes went blank. It was an effective and fast method.
</p><br><p>If the monsters weren’t able to withstand his aura, then they would lose against Adam.
</p><br><p>Why were Valdris and Saegar so confident in Adam’s strength?
</p><br><p>They weren’t, but they realized that Adam was no ordinary Phantom. The dark route was a rare event. Moreover, they couldn’t ignore the fact that Kenward, one of the Lords, was helping him.
</p><br><p>If Rosana had the opportunity, she would do anything to participate in this trial. After all, she was at the right level for it.
</p><br><p>It seemed that Rosana, Osmer, and the rest of the monsters from the Sacrificial Waterfalls no longer had a chance to affect Adam, but that wasn’t entirely true.
</p><br><p>He wasn’t just the Phantom who defeated Rosana. He was the Phantom who was invited by the First Star to the Dark Shore.
</p><br><p>Thanks to Rosana, Osmer was aware that Adam already killed the Hollow Wave monsters. That opened the door for him to ask for help.
</p><br><p>"Ready?" Osmer turned to the muscular man with crimson hair.
</p><br><p>Ivar nodded deeply. "We have to do this. If this young man actually has a chance to reach the level of the Lords, to become one of the stars, then we must not prevent it."
</p><br><p>The rest of the regenerative monsters, along with Rosana, watched Osmer and Iver from the sidelines.
</p><br><p>Their two leaders led them to the eastern skull, with a wide pond full of thick dark blood in the center.
</p><br><p>On the wall was carved an old, shattered image of a majestic crown.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The surface of the lake shuddered when on the other side, as if through a mirror, a large eye with a vertical pupil looked at them.
</p><br><p>"Osmer... Ivar... There has been no news from you for a long time... Has something happened in your distant lands that the authorities should know about... something that the Befallen Crown should know about?"
</p><br><p>They nodded simultaneously, placing their palms against their chests. Their heads lowered in respect.
</p><br><p>"Yes," Osmer uttered. "The black flash brought a stellar Phantom here. For all we know he’s already killed two of the Hollow Wave monsters and... we think he’s going to absorb the Twilight Crystal."
</p><br><p>The eye was silent for a while before returning its attention to them.
</p><br><p>"Why is he still alive?"
</p><br><p>Ivar stepped forward. "Lord Kenward helped him follow the dark route! Now they are at the Soaring Chain Islands!"
</p><br><p>The pupil of the eye narrowed as bloody veins ran from the edges.
</p><br><p>It was enough for the monster on the other side of the lake to realize what the situation was.
</p><br><p>"Saegar... That sly bastard! There’s no way he’s going to kill that Phantom for nothing! He... he’ll use the Twilight Crystal, and his position will become even stronger. We... the Befallen Crown can’t let that happen."
</p><br><p>Osmer nodded in confirmation.
</p><br><p>"What do you command us to do? If it is necessary, we are ready to attack the Soaring Chain Islands."
</p><br><p>"No!" the eye roared, gradually regaining its calm tone. "You will simply die... Even if Kenward stays back, it will bring nothing but your demise. The Sacrificial Waterfalls... You shouldn’t lose your place over such foolishness."
</p><br><p>Ivar and Osmer looked at each other.
</p><br><p>Deep inside they sighed with relief since they knew that fighting at the Soaring Chain Islands would be almost guaranteed death, their regeneration wouldn’t be able to help them.
</p><br><p>"We’ll send three Earls there... That should be enough. It’s time to put an end to Saegar and his rule outside the factions once and for all!" the eye exclaimed.
</p><br><p>Osmer gulped, realizing that a battle of devastating magnitude was about to take place.
</p><br><p>"What if Kenward decides to act... You know, he, like all followers of the Free End, is willing to do anything to get even the Phantoms to travel the dark route. As they say... That’s the intent of the First Star."
</p><br><p>"To hell with the Free End, Kenward, and the First Star! In that case, he’ll die too... Their deaths, especially Saegar’s, will be a great benefit to the Befallen Crown and all monsters!"
</p><br><p>The eye’s powerful voice echoed throughout the Sacrificial Waterfalls.
</p><br><p>"Never forget this. Only with us... Only with the Befallen Crown, we monsters have a chance to achieve a peaceful world once and for all!"
</p><br><p>With a slight shudder across the surface of the lake, the eye disappeared.
</p><br><p>Orders were given, and decisions were made.
</p><br><p>Now, all Osmer, Ivar, Rosana, and the others could do was watch from a distance.
</p><br><br><p>Rosana stepped forward, pointing her gaze northward - toward the Soaring Chain Islands.
</p><br><p>"Mr. Osmer, Mr. Ivar, what happens now?"
</p><br><p>Osmer clenched his fists tighter.
</p><br><p>"Carnage. The necessary elimination of monsters like us... We don’t need traitors helping the Phantoms grow! It won’t lead us to salvation!"
</p><br><p>The other monsters glanced around. They weakly nodded their heads acknowledging Osmer’s words.
</p><br><br><p>A few minutes before the start of the trial, from the distant lands full of great ancient structures, three flashes flew out heading in the same direction.
</p><br><p>Each of them was ready to do whatever was necessary for the will of the Befallen Crown.</p>
