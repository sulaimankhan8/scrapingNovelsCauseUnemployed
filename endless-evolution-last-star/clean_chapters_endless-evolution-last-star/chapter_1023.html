            <h4>Chapter 1023: Salvation for a dark soul (Part 1)</h4><br><p>Risha, Grita, Torz, and all the surviving serpents, both resistance and regular monsters, waited with ragged breaths for Adam and Arnoth to bring their final attacks.
</p><br><p>After Silvana and Adam’s aura received a powerful boost, it was then obvious to everyone that they had a chance again.
</p><br><p>The serpents lost faith in Adam’s victory when he didn’t defeat Arnoth using his path. It should be the end for him because Arnoth was full of power, and Adam couldn’t even make one attack.
</p><br><p>Then, Silvana appeared, and no one could predict what would happen next.
</p><br><p>No one understood what this power was or who the girl was next to Adam, no one except Risha. It didn’t usually happen, it was a rare event, but she could see with her own eyes as K3-Phantom opened his final gates.
</p><br><p>She realized that a lot depended on the Operator.
</p><br><p>The further the Phantom went down the path of evolution, the more important the Operator’s role in it.
</p><br><br><p>The spectral scissors closed abruptly, Adam and Silvana acting in sync, there was not the slightest delay between them. Arnoth and Lost Light performed accordingly, the golden shield and scalding light carrying their full power.
</p><br><p>All the serpents saw was a white blade sweep across the entire castle that could hold thousands of monsters in an instant. It was a majestic structure for the king and queen, a place where serpents could be, even in their monster forms.
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, clouds of dust rose up, with shards of marble and stone flying in all directions.
</p><br><p>The few walls and columns that managed to resist even after all the destruction collapsed instantly - nothing could resist the imaginary cut.
</p><br><p>The ground was split in two, just like the entire castle.
</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" Risha gulped in disbelief.
</p><br><p>Unlike the others, she forced herself not to blink, she saw everything with her own eyes, yet she couldn’t understand anything.
</p><br><p>Everything happened too fast for her.
</p><br><p>However, at the Fallen Ring Castle, there was someone much stronger than she, Adam, or any monster.
</p><br><p>Hygon narrowed his eyes, even though he was stunned. Unlike Risha, he was able to witness everything in detail.
</p><br><p>’Unbelievable... This guy... Hah, so this is what it is like to have a chance to rank up with the strongest, right?’ Hygon grinned darkly. ’Looks like I should learn something from him, otherwise, he’ll soon surpass me, Orel, and Lorana, he’ll be above all of us!’
</p><br><p>Then, his frame shuddered as he disappeared without a trace from the Fallen Ring Castle.
</p><br><p>There was nothing more for Hygon to do here. He was here to save Risha in case of a mortal threat. Now, she was in no danger.
</p><br><br><p>A stream of wind parted the smoke screen, revealing Arnoth’s figure.
</p><br><p>Thick drops of blood dripped from his body, deep smooth slash went from his shoulder to his waist. Adam’s imaginary cut couldn’t slit Arnoth in two, but he struggled to stand on his feet.
</p><br><p>"Gha... Gha... Gha..."
</p><br><p>His breath was heavy, his bones covered in cracks, and his eyes were wide open. He remembered with disbelief how the white cut slashed his shield, all of his and Lost Light’s power in a heartbeat.
</p><br><p>He could only notice that, then the cut passed through him and the castle.
</p><br><br><p>Arnoth collapsed to one knee, noticing the blood on his shoulder. Lost Light was wounded as well.
</p><br><br><p>The imaginary cut could hurt both the physical body and the energy form, even the energy itself could not defend against its power.
</p><br><p>Blood clots, one by one, crashed to the cold floor, flowing into the chasm to Arnoth’s right - the aftermath of Adam’s attack.
</p><br><br><p>A chunk of earth broke away as the great throne collapsed into the abyss.
</p><br><p>"No... We couldn’t lose..."
</p><br><p>Arnoth could not accept this fate.
</p><br><br><p>But, just as he tried to rise, streams of blood rushed from his mouth, flooding the ground in front of him.
</p><br><p>Lost Light hugged him gently out of his last strength, while golden tears flowed from her ajar eyes.
</p><br><p>"This... Arnoth, our journey has come to an end..."
</p><br><br><p>In a leisurely stride, Adam approached Arnoth, his exhausted silhouette casting a shadow over Arnoth, towering over him.
</p><br><p>"That was an honorable fight. Just as you promised." Adam’s voice broke, full of respect and admiration for the history the two of them created.
</p><br><p>Then, Arnoth finally accepted his fate. His expression softened as a bitter smile formed.
</p><br><p>"Damn, you’re right," Arnoth wheezed, the energy quickly leaving his body. Once he had nothing left, he would die, and Lost Light would disappear, going into eternal sleep with him.
</p><br><p>Silvana nodded slightly. "Indeed. Now I understand you better Adam... We are not facing a monster you want to kill with brutality, we are facing a warrior who deserves his decent end..."
</p><br><p>There was no response as Adam took a step back.
</p><br><p>Dense streams of white energy covered his palm, turning it into a spear. It was enough power to seriously wound Arnoth when he was at his peak or to kill Kreyna when they first met.
</p><br><p>Now, Adam was close to the limits of his evolution, but that wasn’t what he cared about right now.
</p><br><p>"Arnoth, do you have anything to say before I do what I have to do?"
</p><br><p>They exchanged a glance.
</p><br><p>Each understood what was behind those words.
</p><br><p>"Actually... Agh!" Arnoth coughed. "When you do... Don’t absorb my and Lost Light’s energy, you have to give it to the monster inside you. I think her name is Moira, right?"
</p><br><p>Adam blinked a few times, confused.
</p><br><p>"But, you said only the Crimson Monarch can change her shell. Are you really going to her...?"
</p><br><p>"Hah..." Arnoth shook his head. "I, like you, don’t have the necessary mastery. I will simply be the sacrifice. It will be my last request to you as my last opponent and my last deed in this world."
</p><br><p>Lost Light hugged him tighter.
</p><br><p>Arnoth touched her arm. "We will leave together and preserve the legacy of the Kyros, Crimson Monarch."
</p><br><br><br><br><p>In a lonely thrust, his palm pierced Arnoth’s heart, ending his life.</p>
