            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1255: Red Bloom (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>As soon as Adam attempted to destroy the outer barrier, the Red Bloom realized that he could become a major threat to her. As long as there was someone with such abilities in the dark forest, she could not be sure that she would be able to maintain control over the territory for long.</p><br><p>“Adam Vinter…” Red Bloom muttered, as if trying to remember if she had heard that name before. “It sounds familiar. Hmm…”</p><br><p>Then, she glanced at Garrah, and a sly smile formed on her face.</p><br><p>The Red Bloom waved her hand, and several petals swirled around her in a calm whirlwind.</p><br><p>“Well, Adam, as I understand it, this forest wasn’t your original destination, right? I was wondering why the fighter jet flew right here, but now everything makes sense.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly. He saw no point in hiding it.</p><br><p>“Yes. This forest is not my final destination. It’s not hard to guess, especially for someone who has eyes all over the forest.”</p><br><p>The Red Bloom lifted her chin, looking down at Adam.</p><br><p>“And? Where are you going? Although I know the answer—the Glass Bridge, right?”</p><br><br><p>“So, in that case, how about just not getting in my way?”</p><br><p>A slight frown covered Adam’s face.</p><br><br><p>The Red Bloom waved her hand carelessly.</p><br><p>“Considering that you shouldn’t be here in the first place, I’m willing to offer you another option, one that’s much better than an inglorious death.”</p><br><p>Adam said nothing, nor did Garrah, who remained silent despite the Red Bloom’s attempts to get rid of Adam without a fight. For him and all the monsters of the forest, it was a threat no less than the Red Bloom herself.</p><br><p>“I’ll just let you go and allow you to reach the Glass Bridge unhindered. If you want, I can even give you some energy. There’s plenty of it here in this forest!”</p><br><p>However, instead of questions or agreement as the best option, the Red Bloom received only mocking laughter in response.</p><br><p>“Hahahahahaha!” Adam laughed uncontrollably. “Did you really think that would work? Why would I agree to your offer now?”</p><br><p>He waved his hand. “Maybe if you had appeared in front of me when I tried to destroy the outer barrier, I would have thought about it or even agreed. But now? Pffft, you don’t stand a chance!”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam’s reaction angered the Red Bloom, which was evident from the grimace that covered her face.</p><br><p>It was humiliating for her!</p><br><p>“What? What do you mean? What’s the point?! You won’t fight me, you’ll save your energy and your life! There are only advantages for you here, you little human bastard!”</p><br><p>Her furious shout sent a shiver through every monster around, even Silvana, who was far away in the Citadel, gulped, feeling the power and anger in the Red Bloom’s voice.</p><br><p>Yet, Adam just shrugged carelessly.</p><br><p>“Sorry, but I don’t betray those with whom I’ve shared a meal. If I do, I’ll remember it for the rest of my life. I don’t want that kind of problem with my conscience.”</p><br><p>“In that case, you should…!”</p><br><br><p>Before the Red Bloom could finish, Adam’s frame trembled as he appeared right in front of her.</p><br><p>It was unexpected for both the Red Bloom and Garrah.</p><br><p>They both tried to keep up with Adam’s actions, one to help him, the other to protect herself.</p><br><p>But Adam acted quickly.</p><br><br><p>A wide swing swept past the Red Bloom, cutting through her curls. If not for her reaction, her severed head would have already fallen to the ground.</p><br><p>As soon as she saw her hair flying past her eyes, the veins on her face swelled, and an unprecedented rage ignited deep within her.</p><br><p>No one dared touch her.</p><br><br><p>She blocked the next slash with a stream of petals, but the impact threw her back dozens of meters.</p><br><br><p>The Red Bloom exclaimed, summoning dozens of dark roots from the ground. They rose above the forest, casting shadows from the bright sun, while red streams of energy ran through their frames, filling them with power.</p><br><p>“I don’t know what you think you are, but you will regret what you have done! This forest, all these monsters, and you will only fuel my evolution!”</p><br><p>Garrah’s eyes widened in panic.</p><br><p>“Shit! Adam, get away! I can’t block all these roots!”</p><br><p>Despite his warnings, Adam didn’t move. His needle shattered into pieces as white energy swirled around his arms.</p><br><p>Soon, two white discs rose above his hand, and one with a keen eye could see countless silver threads wrapped around the discs like compact but dangerous spools of an experienced weaver.</p><br><p>“A few levels ago, this power was beyond my comprehension. They seemed like simple threads, but… controlling them was too difficult,” Adam muttered and looked down as his discs slowly began to move.</p><br><p>He sighed deeply as Lone Blaze’s silhouette appeared in his mind.</p><br><p>“Even now, I wouldn’t be able to show all of its power, but fortunately, I have an assistant. Thank you, you were able to restore this ability to me and allow me to show what the threads are capable of.”</p><br><p>At that moment, particles of light appeared to his right, gathering into the figure of a girl with white hair, sparse red curls, and a slight smile.</p><br><p>Unlike Silvana’s spectral form, which everyone could see, Lone Blaze revealed herself only to Adam, for one brief moment.</p><br><p>Then, she disappeared, returning his attention to the approaching roots. Adam had no more than three seconds left.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the discs spun at high speed, releasing a multitude of threads, rushing past his eyes in a smooth motion.</p><br><p>“This, the threads, this is my beginning.”</p><br><p>Abruptly, Adam waved his arms, causing all the threads to stretch to their limits, the discs holding them, allowing Adam to control them.</p><br><p>As soon as the wave ended, a sharp glare like a fleeting constellation covered the space in front of Adam, cutting the great roots into pieces that would soon burn in a victorious bonfire.</p>
