            <br><p>"A message from Damien...?" Adam muttered with a slight hope in his voice.</p><br><p>Adam wasn't stupid and realized that if Damien wanted to, he could get him out of any problem. After all, Damien alone was keeping millions of people alive. His wish was practically law, though... there were those in the Citadel who could stand up to even him.</p><br><p>Tron nodded. He came here on a quick mission and then left. However, he also had a personal interest.</p><br><p>"Yes. I don't have much time so listen. It's a quote - 'Don't forget that besides Azure Lotus, there are two other powerful forces. Perhaps you should act using their laws if the equality and hypocrisy of the Azure Lotus doesn't appeal to you.'"</p><br><p>Adam got a strange look on his face for this was more of a mystery than advice. Sure, he knew about Dark Order and Crimson Path and the ideologies they followed. However, he didn't quite understand how that was supposed to help him in Fall Hill Prison.</p><br><p>"Also, I'll give you one more piece of advice, from me. If you want to get through six months comfortably, get involved with someone from Crimson Path, especially the women. It depends on how long you're going to stay there, though, and whether you can get out. Bye." Tron waved before heading off around the corner.</p><br><p>Adam blinked a few times, mulling over Tron's words.</p><br><br><p>Then, he jerked forward, about to ask him something, but... Tron was gone, it seemed like he had just disappeared.</p><br><p>"Crimson Path... Well, that makes sense. If they act like Zera, it'll give me an advantage... However... What did he mean about whether I can get out and how long I plan on being in prison...?" Adam muttered in confusion.</p><br><p>At the time, thoughts of escape had not yet entered his mind, just guesses, because he was not planning to escape.</p><br><p>If he escaped from prison, sooner or later, he would be caught, right? What's more, becoming a fugitive criminal would make life very difficult for his family.</p><br><p>'I have to do five months and go back to normal... or I have to realize what Damien and Tron wanted to convey to me. Phantoms and prison... that in itself sounds weird...' Adam shook his head before heading for the exit.</p><br><p>Even though he was a K1-Phantom, this was the first time he had ever been in trouble with the government and the law. He wasn't surprised that there was a prison for Phantoms in the Citadel, after all, they were humans too and could commit crimes.</p><br><p>Someone had to control it so chaos wouldn't break out inside the Citadel. Sure, only Phantoms could restrict the freedom of other Phantoms, but... were the prisons mandatory?</p><br><br><p>Adam opened the door behind which Raina and several police officers had been waiting for him for some time. This wouldn't have happened if he was a common criminal, but things were different for the Phantoms...</p><br><p>Raina didn't say anything. She just pointed at the car with a worried expression. She was clearly affected by her encounter with Tron. His aura almost broke her in seconds.</p><br><p>When ordinary people with power faced Phantoms, especially from the Dark Order, their worldview would change for a while, until things returned to normal until the next confrontation.</p><br><p>Raina could be strict and arrogant in front of common criminals, but not in front of Phantoms.</p><br><p>Yeah, the problem could be solved if there were other Phantoms among the police force, but... That was impossible as it was too irrational.</p><br><p>Only a tiny fraction of the Phantoms rarely visited Dead Lands, doing some necessary work in the Citadel.</p><br><p>For example, Prago - was a warden at Fall Hill Prison, and it was already a great loss because instead of killing monsters as K2-Phantom, he was keeping an eye on Phantom criminals.</p><br><p>The government was doing its best to reduce the need for the Phantoms to work inside the Citadel, but in some places, it was necessary.</p><br><p>The car shifted, heading straight for the Second Ring.</p><br><p>Soon, they descended into an underground tunnel. After just a few hours, they reached the Second Ring.</p><br><p>The Citadel was huge, but space was limited, so the prison was underground - only the administration building was on the surface - it wasn't even walled off.</p><br><p>Raina opened the door, and Adam stepped outside, following her.</p><br><p>From the outside, it looked like he was some important person with his servants rather than a criminal.</p><br><p>'Well.... Well... This doesn't look cool at all...' Adam muttered, glancing around.</p><br><p>There were only endless tunnels leading to different places on the sewer level.</p><br><p>The Lower Ring was also at the bottom of the Citadel, however, it was much, much deeper - dozens if not hundreds of meters down.</p><br><p>The entrance to Fall Hill Prison was a massive gateway with a long passageway of snow-white walls and soft blue lighting.</p><br><p>The designers involved in the prison construction believed that such tranquil colors would help the Phantoms return to normal faster, get rid of their criminal past, and start fighting in Dead Lands again.</p><br><p>Apparently, the government wanted the Phantoms to live well so they wouldn't have any problems because their performance in Dead Lands and the safety of the Citadel depended on it.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter, right?" A man in square glasses asked from behind a glass barrier in the small room.</p><br><p>"Yes. Sentenced for six months for murder." Raina nodded.</p><br><p>The man looked something up in his tablet and sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"I see... Proud Wing... them again. Raina, you don't want to admit it, but among them are the ones who cause nothing but trouble."</p><br><p>Raina frowned, clenching her fists tightly.</p><br><p>"Olav, he killed a man!"</p><br><p>"Yeah... yeah... Just like some of the other Phantoms after encountering the newbies of the Proud Wing. Are those really coincidences? Whatever, Raina, is right, you committed murder, so you'll have to stay here for the next five months." Olav waved his hand nonchalantly. He didn't seem to agree with Azure Lotus or Proud Wing even though he was a mere human.</p><br><p>"Five months...?" Adam tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>"Sure. After that long, you'll be free if you don't cause trouble. I understand your confusion, but you'll soon realize that you have to try hard to make trouble here."</p><br><p>"Khm." Olav coughed, as he slurred, "Perhaps even less..."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment.</p><br><p>Then, Olav looked at Adam and handed him a box containing a set of white clothes, a bracelet with a screen, and a gray card with the number - '0' on it.</p><br><p>"Here. Also, you'll have to give up your NEP and Nexus for the duration of your sentence. Don't worry, your Operator and friends will be able to contact you through this bracelet or any other means." Olav explained.</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam nodded, taking off his gloves and NEP. He didn't argue, his gloves were his weapons, and it would be strange if he was allowed to enter the prison with a weapon.</p><br><p>However... The fists of any Phantom were already weapons themselves, for they were more powerful than any hammers and their palms sharper than any spears. They didn't need weapons to make the threat.</p><br><p>"Good." Olav nodded and pressed a button, making contact with someone, "Lola, come to the main entrance."</p><br><p>Raina cast a hard look at Adam and headed for the exit.</p><br><p>Her job as a police officer was already done, now Adam was a prisoner, and she had to get back to her regular duties.</p><br><p>A moment later, the white mechanical doors opened as a short girl with scarlet hair and two long pigtails stepped forward.</p><br><p>Her eyes sparkled, and she had a slight smile on her face like a child who saw something interesting.</p><br><p>"This is Lola, she will help you get settled in and answer all your questions. You can also go to her at any time for help. Technically she's one of the Wardens, but in fact, she's just your F-Zone's assistant." Olav said calmly, it wasn't the first time he had to explain something to a baffled Phantom.</p><br><p>It didn't help much, though.</p><br><p>The more Adam listened, with each passing second in Fall Hill Prison the weirder he felt. It seemed to him that he had arrived not in a prison but in a hotel with unusual rules.</p><br><p>As a slum dweller, Adam was well aware of what prisons, or rather, their parodies in slums, were capable of. Not from his own experience, but from stories and rumors.</p><br><p>However, something was bothering him. He felt mildly curious and even anxious, as if Fall Hill Prison was not a peaceful place, at all.</p><br><p>"But... Who's the real warden then?"</p><br><p>"Oh, shouldn't you already know? This is Prago Avino, K2-Phantom. This is K1-Prison, so he alone is enough to keep an eye on you. It's not that simple, though. I'm sure you'll figure it out soon enough. In fact, you should go now." Olav glanced at Lola, who approached Adam.</p><br><p>"Hello!" Lola said vigorously as she bowed low, "My name is Lola Haylane, please, follow me. I will take you to your cell and tell you about our prison."</p><br><p>Adam nodded, following her.</p><br><p>Lola walked beside him, pacing at the same pace.</p><br><p>At this time, Olav put away Adam's stuff in the safe and sighed heavily, looking at his departing back.</p><br><p>'Adam Vinter, right? The police have no access to the Phantoms' activities outside the Citadel, so... Raina and Prago don't know yet that they'd be better off listening to Douglas and just giving him a fine... Something interesting is coming, or maybe a disaster...?'</p>
