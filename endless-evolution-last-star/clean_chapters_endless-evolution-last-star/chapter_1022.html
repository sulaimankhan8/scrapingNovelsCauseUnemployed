            <h4>Chapter 1022: Imaginary Cut (Part 4)</h4><br><p>Adam didn’t know what was happening.
</p><br><p>He had a few guesses after he felt the sudden increase in strength. He knew that this could only happen if the fifth gate opened and the Crystal Gates finally collapsed, but he just couldn’t believe it.
</p><br><p>But when Silvana appeared beside him in her spectral form, like a ghost from a dream, he was completely confused.
</p><br><p>Some power within him had awakened, he could feel it, but the Evolution Tree gave him no information.
</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree had left that task to Silvana, for now for the first time she was to do her job as Operator right on the battlefield. Not only as Adam’s ally but as a partner who fights alongside him.
</p><br><p>For Arnoth and Lost Light it was a shock as much as for Adam. They didn’t expect him to actually be able to get stronger in the middle of a fight.
</p><br><p>Arnoth was constantly watching Adam’s aura and his movements. He was doing everything necessary to keep the pace of the fight constant, not allowing Adam to be distracted even for a few moments.
</p><br><p>However, it happened.
</p><br><p>Adam’s energy continued to burn brightly like a white flame, becoming a home for both him and Silvana.
</p><br><p>She no longer needed to use the shared voice, the shared sigh, or the cameras to see what was happening on the battlefield.
</p><br><p>"Where..." Adam stammered, looking at Silvana’s left arm, her only arm. "What happened to your right arm?"
</p><br><p>"Hah... You don’t have to worry about that. I just got the same wounds as you. Consider that was one of the conditions."
</p><br><p>Adam gulped. Something was still unclear to him.
</p><br><p>"But... Why the right arm?"
</p><br><p>It was a good question, for in Arnoth’s attack, he had lost not his right arm but his left arm.
</p><br><p>"Well, I couldn’t figure it out either, but once it all happened, it became obvious to me. You’ll find out soon enough, and..." she narrowed her eyes. "We don’t have time to talk anymore."
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The golden ring was nearing completion.
</p><br><p>But something prevented the final symbols from being created. A few sparks flew in front of Arnoth’s confused face.
</p><br><br><p>Then, he turned his head.
</p><br><p>"Lost Light, what’s wrong?"
</p><br><p>Slowly, Lost Light lifted her head from his broad shoulder.
</p><br><p>"That girl... She’s dangerous. We can’t go on, we have to get rid of her!"
</p><br><p>Before Arnoth could say anything, Lost Light opened her eyes for the first time in their fight.
</p><br><p>Her eyes were amber, the same as Arnoth’s, but more intense and aggressive, like two cruel suns with constantly raging flames.
</p><br><p>Scalding light descended upon Adam, but his white, calm energy met it with ease.
</p><br><p>Lost Light wasn’t going to stop there. She saw Silvana as a threat and was going to kill her at any cost.
</p><br><p>"You... You can’t save his soul!"
</p><br><p>Bright flashes appeared among the light, unleashing beams of light on Silvana meant to shatter her spectral form into fragments.
</p><br><p>But, around Silvana appeared disks of darkness that effortlessly absorbed each beam, preventing Lost Light from even scratching her.
</p><br><p>"You won’t succeed, the External Artifact, you missed your opportunity to kill my Phantom."
</p><br><p>Silvana’s voice was harsh, with no compromise.
</p><br><p>"We have to go back to the way things have always been - respect."
</p><br><p>Lost Light answered nothing, she just gritted her teeth in anger. It didn’t suit her delicate face.
</p><br><p>After a few moments, she closed her eyes, directing her energy towards the golden ring.
</p><br><p>Arnoth became alert. He realized why Lost Light had decided to act so abruptly.
</p><br><p>’That young man...’ he muttered, staring at Adam. ’I can feel it. He is no longer weaker than me, he is now my equal in power. His energy is as dense as mine, and soon he may surpass me!’
</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam felt Silvana pressed harder against him from behind as her left arm headed towards his injured shoulder.
</p><br><p>"Listen to me carefully. We have to do this right if we want to win..." Silvana muttered as her left arm practically replaced his lost one.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Space shuddered when out of white energy and purple fragments, a blade appeared. However, it had a round handle, for it was not just a blade but half of a great pair of scissors.
</p><br><p>Slowly, Silvana grasped the top blade with her one hand, lightly guiding it upwards like open scissors.
</p><br><p>"Wait... That’s...!" Adam gasped in disbelief.
</p><br><p>Silvana smiled weakly. "Yes, this is my non-existent past... The way I protected you, the way I fought with my weapon."
</p><br><p>Golden light fell on their faces as the ring trembled. Energy streams ran through each symbol as Arnoth stepped forward.
</p><br><p>"Adam! It’s time to find out whose soul will be the last!" Arnoth exclaimed as he stepped forward.
</p><br><p>His palm slammed into the center of the ring, throwing towards Adam a massive silhouette of a golden shield carrying a devastating stream of light behind it. Nothing in the vicinity could resist for more than a moment, shattering into pieces, the ground turning to dust.
</p><br><p>Before Adam realized it, a second blade appeared in his hand.
</p><br><p>The scissors had two parts, to hold such a large scissors needed two hands, because of their wounds, with only the two of them they could use this ability.
</p><br><p>"Adam..." Silvana whispered, guiding her blade towards Adam’s. "I give you the power, but I, as well as all this energy, belong to you... It’s your decision when to make the cut."
</p><br><br><p>He understood what needed to be done, but only Silvana knew what effect to expect from the spectral scissors.
</p><br><p>This was a new branch in his power.
</p><br><p>"Alright, I’ll do what I have to do," Adam uttered before pushing his hand down, forcing the scissors closed.
</p><br><p>The purple-white flash formed at the tip of the two blades before blinding the fallen ring lands, forcing each serpent to close its eyes for a moment.
</p><br><p>Then, the nearly invisible blade, faster than Adam’s path, swept through the entire castle, slashing the massive structure in two, and everything in the path of the imaginary cut.</p>
