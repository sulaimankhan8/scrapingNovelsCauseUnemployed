            <br><p>Oddly enough, although Heira was a high noble and knew more about the Twilight Palace than Adam, she was as surprised to see the message as he was.</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" Adam muttered in confusion.</p><br><p>'Hmm...' he mused, 'Andreas didn't mention anything like that. I don't know what's going on here, but it's not good news to me.</p><br><p>Adam looked around. In the distance the nobles were still going about their business, some talking, some going to the stores, and so on. The message was only for Adam and Heira, this was not a mass event.</p><br><p>Throwing a glance at Adam, then at her NEP, Heira grabbed her head.</p><br><p>"What do you mean the fight was denied? What do you mean the fight is unequal? What the hell are the bets?! Aren't the contestants the only ones who decide when the fight should happen?!"</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow. He hoped to get some explanation from Heira, but it was obvious that she didn't know any more than he did.</p><br><p>At the same time, Silvana poked him lightly with her elbow.</p><br><p>'Hey...' she whispered, 'Why don't you just attack her anyway? You only have one victory left. Any nobleman will be good enough for that. I don't know what the administration is up to, but we can outplay them.'</p><br><p>However, it wasn't that simple.</p><br><p>"Nah, I'm afraid that won't work." Adam shook his head.</p><br><br><p>"Well... Finding a nobleman who has at least one twilight coin is not a difficult task. But, I'm sure the administration just won't count it. Andreas mentioned something like that."</p><br><p>Then, Adam held his hand up, showing Silvana his NEP.</p><br><p>"Considering what they just did - literally not allowing us to fight, then not counting my coin received outside of an official fight would be even easier for them."</p><br><p>Heira's first thought was that Adam had pulled some kind of trick, but she quickly realized that he was a victim of circumstances just like she.</p><br><p>"And, what do we do now? Is there any point in fighting?" Heira scratched the back of her head, confused.</p><br><p>"I don't think so. I'm not refusing to fight, it doesn't benefit me, but until we understand what's going on there's no point."</p><br><p>After a brief thought, Adam glanced around.</p><br><p>"I think we need to find an observer. If anyone knows about the administration's plans, it's them."</p><br><p>Heira nodded silently a few times. Her eyes showed a genuine desire to test her strength against Adam Vinter. Unfortunately for her, the administration had a different opinion.</p><br><p>Suddenly, the high ceilings revealed a multitude of tiles, small, palm-sized ones. They ran in rows, set up in advance for special occasions. Behind the tiles were cameras, releasing a faint blue glow.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a transparent column with the number "0" appeared above each Phantom's head. The exceptions were Silvana, the other Operators, and the observers.</p><br><p>Adam and Heira glanced over, their eyes wide in shock, then they looked up convinced of the reality of the ghostly figure.</p><br><p>The rest of the nobles found themselves in the same situation.</p><br><p>For most of them, this was the first time this had happened, as the Final Bet took place at the Twilight Palace quite rarely, no more than once every two months.</p><br><p>Conversation broke out among the nobles, each trying to figure out what was going on.</p><br><p>Soon, they got their answers.</p><br><br><p>A powerful male voice rang out seemingly from all directions at once, reaching the ears of every noble at the northern part of the Twilight Palace.</p><br><p>"This is observer no. 2. I hasten to report that the Final Bet has begun."</p><br><p>The nobles, young men, and ladies exchanged a glance, all with confused expressions.</p><br><br><p>"Is this something new? I've never heard of it."</p><br><p>His buddy frowned heavily.</p><br><p>"Shit! I'm annoyed with the administration. Aren't they just ordinary people? Why do they have so many rights and even the ability to hide things from us?!"</p><br><p>The discontent among the nobles was growing, it was understandable and righteous, but for observer no. 2, it was nothing.</p><br><p>"In five minutes, the Final Bet will enter an active phase that will last exactly ten minutes. As the name implies, you will be bet on, with real money."</p><br><p>"What the hell are you talking about? At the Twilight Palace, no one needs real money! Only twilight coins matter here!" one of the nobles exclaimed.</p><br><p>A measured voice sounded from the side.</p><br><p>"That's true, but the betting will not be done by the Phantoms at the Twilight Palace but by all the invited members of the Twelve Branches, as well as the important government representatives.</p><br><p>"The reason for the bets is very simple, the amounts above your heads will show the interest of the higher-ups in each Phantom from the new generation who happens to be at the Twilight Palace at this time.</p><br><p>"In the end, the two individuals with the highest numbers, those who have received the largest bets for their person, will face off in battle - in the final one."</p><br><p>After a brief pause, observer no. 2, continued:</p><br><p>"This is a special battle in which it doesn't matter the current or future amount of the twilight coins. Both the winner and the loser will leave the Twilight Palace immediately after the final battle, as they will have no more twilight coins left.</p><br><p>"Also, observers can vote as well. Their votes will be counted separately, but in truth, it will only be an official confirmation of the bets made.</p><br><p>"The last thing you need to know before the guests start betting is that the final battle will be monitored by observer no. 1. This is the most serious event possible. When observer no. 1 arrives, there will be bets on something more than money, something more important to the great families."</p><br><p>Even though this was supposed to be the explanation, observer no. 2, kept many things from the young nobles.</p><br><p>However, he informed them of the most important thing - the function of the stakes and zeros hovering above their heads.</p><br><p>It was useless to protest, because when observer no. 2, mentioned that the betting would be done by the members of the great families, all anxiety ceased, only worry remained.</p><br><p>The nobles realized that the most likely bets would be made by their relatives, members of their families holding a much higher position than them.</p><br><p>Thus, everyone's gazes settled on the hovering figures that soon trembled.</p><br><p>The first bets went in, and deep inside, each noble hoped to be recognized by their elders, to become the owner of the highest bet.</p>
