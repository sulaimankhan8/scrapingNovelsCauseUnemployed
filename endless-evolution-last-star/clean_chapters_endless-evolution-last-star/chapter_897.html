            <br><br><p>Reinz lunged forward, his electric claws scratched Julia's bloody armor, but no sooner had he counterattacked than her fist plunged into his stomach.</p><br><p>Trying to regain his balance, Reinz did a somersault landing on his feet.</p><br><p>Julia was already in front of him.</p><br><p>Two crystal tails slammed into his sides, a shiver ran through his body with loud crunches from his cracked ribs.</p><br><p>"Argh!" Reinz gasped in pain when Julia's knee smashed into his face.</p><br><p>With a broken nose, Reinz flew off to the side rolling over the dusty surface of the arena.</p><br><br><p>Reinz crashed into a slab of stone, clots of blood spurting from his mouth. Another attempt to attack Julia was unsuccessful. There were dozens of ordinary steel swords lying around - he tried to use the Outer Energy Control on them, but he couldn't succeed once.</p><br><p>Dealing with one, Julia turned to stare intently at Adam, who was supposed to be helping Reinz. However, instead, he stood leaning against the wall, his arms crossed over his chest.</p><br><p>"How long are you going to stand there? Erik said you have three days to learn how to use the Outer Energy Control. It's already day two and you still refuse to fight!" Julia waved her hand.</p><br><p>At this time, Reinz was hoarsely rising from the ground. His wounds were making themselves known, but they weren't serious enough for Julia to use Erik's blood to heal him.</p><br><p>Opening his eyes, Adam looked up at an annoyed Julia.</p><br><p>"I think..." he muttered, "Just stay out of my way and tomorrow you'll see everything... Anyway, Reinz needs your help more than I do, isn't that right?"</p><br><p>Unfortunately for Julia, it was. If it wasn't that way, she would have beaten him up long ago for his arrogance, but she needed to focus on Reinz.</p><br><p>Unlike Adam who two days ago used the second type of energy control on a simple bun turning it into a sturdy wall-breaking object, Reinz was not having any success.</p><br><p>"Tsk." Julia snorted.</p><br><p>Reinz raised his head when her shadow fell on him.</p><br><p>"Get up. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You're the talent of the first great family and you still can't master the Outer Energy Control?"</p><br><p>Before he could reply, her foot crashed into his jaw knocking out one tooth.</p><br><p>"You nobles try to hide it, but you have a lot more energy in your blood originally than someone like Adam."</p><br><br><p>"You're a fucking high nobleman. From birth, you practically had a guarantee you'd become a Phantom."</p><br><br><p>With a painful sob, Reinz collapsed to the ground. Despite Julia's words, there was no resentment or hatred for her in his eyes, only disappointment in himself.</p><br><p>Julia's leg came into motion, but she stopped at the last moment seeing Reinz's trembling lips.</p><br><p>"Still..." he muttered, "This chance didn't fall to me, you know that, don't you?"</p><br><p>Adam's right eye snapped open as he glanced at Reinz. He heard something he hadn't expected at all.</p><br><p>However, it didn't impress Julia in the least.</p><br><br><p>Her boot pressed against the back of his head, stamping his face into the ground with brute force.</p><br><p>"Of course I am. If I want I'll find out what you had for breakfast, what your favorite color is, and how many times a week you jerk off! I'm an Operator dammit!" Julia shouted kicking him in the stomach, "That's not the point! You were unlucky, but you still killed the monster and became the Phantom. You did that but you can't master the second type of Energy Control?"</p><br><p>Reinz gritted his teeth and looked at her menacingly from below, "You think I don't want to? Then explain to me how Adam, a commoner mastered the Outer Energy Control so quickly? I still can't channel energy into swords, and he turned an ordinary bun into a weapon!"</p><br><p>Without saying anything, Julia turned around, slowly stepping aside.</p><br><p>"Hah, are you really jealous of Adam? Shouldn't you be looking down on him? After all, he's a commoner and you're the highest noble from the Alderran Family."</p><br><p>"Gha..." Reinz rose from the ground with a grunt, "I don't share that position. Once you become a Phantom, then everything else ceases to matter.</p><br><p>"If you're strong then you're doing the right thing, if you're weak then you're wrong."</p><br><p>With a dark look, Reinz prepared for battle taking another sword by the hilt.</p><br><p>"If you're alive then you're right. If you're dead, then you're wrong.</p><br><p>"That's all that matters."</p><br><p>A sly smile appeared on Julia's face. She shook her head as the two tails from her armor began to sway behind her.</p><br><p>"Hah..." she giggled, "That's a pretty emphatic stance, you know? But, I won't say you're wrong. Go ahead and attack, you little shit!"</p><br><p>Their bodies twitched they were ready to rush into battle.</p><br><p>Suddenly, a shadow appeared in front of Julia, Adam's hand fell on her forearms, stopping her at the last moment.</p><br><p>Julia was about to yell at him, which was her style, but something prevented her from doing so.</p><br><p>'Agh... What's wrong with this guy?'</p><br><p>Adam's gaze was sad, and his blue eyes shone brightly like gems at the bottom of the ocean.</p><br><p>In silence, he pulled his sword from the ground and headed towards the baffled Reinz.</p><br><p>"So you're also a Natural Phantom like me?"</p><br><br><p>"Yes... Is that surprising to you? The higher nobles have a very high chance of revealing the Spark, but... it's not 100% probability. Some of us have to take mortal risks."</p><br><p>"Pffft." Adam snorted, "Mortal risk? I'm sure you were trained for battle your entire childhood. Given the best non-gene weapons and all the necessary conditions to kill some weak monster."</p><br><br><p>"Moreover... Until this day, I didn't know that nobles have stronger blood not only because of bloodline but also because of energy density." Adam glanced at the sword, the reflection of his stern face in the sharp blade.</p><br><p>He pointed the weapon at Reinz.</p><br><p>"Go ahead. I'll help you. I don't want to think my opponent was weak."</p>
