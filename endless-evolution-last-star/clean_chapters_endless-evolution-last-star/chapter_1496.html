            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1496: Winding Fragments (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>It didn’t matter what the other Phantoms were doing or what their goals were. Frida continued to work as the guardian angel of every Phantom who found themselves in a life-threatening situation.</p><br><p>If all conditions were met and Frida could save a Phantom without killing dozens of people with her devastating power, her spear would fly at tremendous speed straight to the battlefield.</p><br><p>Her island was hidden more carefully than Heaven Island. After all, Adam had known about Heaven Island and Queen Elisa for a long time, but only now did he see Azure Island. Moreover, he was looking at it from afar. It was unknown if he would ever have the opportunity to visit it.</p><br><br><p>Another spear flew out from Azure Island, heading west. In the morning, Frida’s actions went unnoticed because of how high her island was.</p><br><p>At night, the sky and clouds could not hide the bright blue light of the giant spear cutting through the sky, but to ordinary people, it looked like shooting stars, and there was nothing unusual about it.</p><br><p>‘Hah,’ Adam hummed internally. ‘So on those nights when there was a real meteor shower, it was probably just Frida’s hard day’s work? Although… that also means that dozens of Phantoms were in mortal danger at that time.’</p><br><p>“Alright.” Damien waved his hand as the wind picked up again. “Enough wasting time. It’s rude to keep the Queen herself waiting! Hahaha!”</p><br><p>Riding the wind currents, soon they all found themselves at the edge of Heaven Island.</p><br><p>Last time, Adam had come through the official entrance, moving along the roads among the few buildings that filled the island.</p><br><p>Now, they found themselves in an area where there were no paths, only rocks, a large number of cyan crystals growing on every patch of land, and a crystal clear, brightly shining pond ahead.</p><br><p>“Wait, wait, wait…!” Alexia’s eyes widened as she approached the pond. “This pond… It’s not water, it’s all pure energy?”</p><br><p>Beth, who was following Damien, nodded slightly.</p><br><p>“Almost. A small percentage of it is still water, but yeah, there’s a tremendous amount of energy here. It’s enough to supply the entire Citadel with electricity for a year if you connect it to a suitable generator. However, using this energy in that way would be foolish and wasteful.”</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, touching one of the crystals. A gentle flow of energy passed through his hand as his heart began to beat more slowly and his breathing became calm.</p><br><p>He knew that Queen Elisa’s energy was special, just her aura was enough to slow down the perception of time.</p><br><p>‘What kind of threat did the Citadel face if even such a powerful Phantom as she had to make such a sacrifice and basically become a shield and a tool for the good of millions of humans?</p><br><p>Adam thought about this several times. He imagined how dangerous a warrior Queen Elisa had been in battle in her time. Although… he knew too little about her.</p><br><p>He didn’t even know how old Queen Elisa was or what state humanity was in back then.</p><br><br><p>Silvana tugged on Adam’s sleeve as he opened his eyes.</p><br><br><p>“Adam, is something wrong?” Silvana asked with a hint of concern in her voice. “I thought you had fallen asleep.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam nodded.</p><br><p>“Yeah… I think it would be safe to say that. Queen Elisa’s energy is really something else.”</p><br><p>Then, he turned to Damien, who, despite his earlier words, was in no hurry to leave. He was curious to see how Adam and Alexia would react to Queen Elisa’s energy.</p><br><p>In fact, the crystals and pond were not energy that came directly from Queen Elisa. Many years ago, they were just ordinary rocks and water, but since they had been near Queen Elisa for a long time, they had completely changed, and ordinary rock had become high-level energy crystals.</p><br><p>Queen Elisa resembled the force of nature itself, even though she had once been a human. She still was, but it was unknown if she would ever wake up from her sleep.</p><br><p>“Damien, you lived with Queen Elisa at one time, didn’t you?” Adam asked, his gaze serious.</p><br><p>Beth shot a sharp glare at Damien. These were not things he could discuss with a K4-Phantom.</p><br><p>But… even Beth had no control over Damien. She could warn him, but she couldn’t force him.</p><br><p>“Yeah, I know Queen Elisa personally. Why?”</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>“If you fought her, who would win? You’re the strongest, right? So… Are you strong enough to defeat even Queen Elisa?”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, there was no tension despite the weight of his question.</p><br><p>Damien just waved his hand.</p><br><p>“You’re asking the wrong question, Adam. Considering that we’re talking about her, it’s not about who she fights or who her ally is. Only one factor will decide everything — who attacks first. Whoever attacks first will win, it’s that simple.”</p><br><p>That wasn’t the answer Adam was hoping for. He was about to ask another question, but Damien didn’t give him the chance.</p><br><p>“Alright, follow me! We’re going straight to Queen Elisa!” He exclaimed and stepped forward.</p><br><p>It didn’t matter whether the others wanted to follow him or not, powerful gusts of wind forced them to follow him, away from the pond and the edge of the island.</p><br><p>As they approached the gray tower that hid Queen Elisa from prying eyes, several Gamma Division personnel noticed them.</p><br><p>They didn’t know that someone was supposed to visit Queen Elisa, but when they saw Damien among the Phantoms, they immediately understood.</p><br><p>Unlike Frida, who trained the other Phantoms, Damien acted more spontaneously and carelessly. Among the younger generation, there were several Phantoms who aroused his curiosity.</p><br><p>Adam and Alexia were among them. So, he sometimes helped them and interfered in their affairs if he deemed it necessary.</p><br><p>Still, even Damien should not disturb Queen Elisa without notification.</p><br><br><p>A tall man with broad shoulders stood in front of the gate as he looked at Damien.</p><br><p>There was a slight frown on his face, but Damien didn’t seem to notice it as he waved his hand.</p><br><p>“Hey! We’ve come to see the queen!”</p><br><p>‘Ah…’ The man shook his head inwardly. ‘Him again… He is a real curse.’</p>
