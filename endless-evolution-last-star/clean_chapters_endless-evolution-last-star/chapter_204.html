            <br><p>Adam was used to coming out of every situation as a winner, defeating every opponent he faced, and never giving up.</p><br><p>However, his path was not filled with only one success. It was not smooth and easy, especially for those around him.</p><br><p>Perhaps it was his luck or his genes, but he had already seen many deaths of other Phantoms and military personnel, some right next to him, and he couldn't protect them.</p><br><p>Adam realized that right now he needed to escape, and to do so, he should use everything he had.</p><br><p>His First Nexus Trait and using The Will, was a good option, stopping the eight dark Phantoms for a short period.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The snow-white aura emanating from the creature woven from silver threads made the Phantoms get down on one knee, it seemed that just a little more and their defenses would fall. Although they were members of the Ruby Dew and came from the Lower Ring, but that didn't mean they possessed The Will.</p><br><p>It was indeed a rarity among the K1-Phantoms, and to some extent, it was Adam's trump card, but... It wasn't as simple as it might seem at first glance.</p><br><br><p>After a few seconds, Tirana and Olax summoned their Spirits, quickly overwhelming Adam's one and making way for the others.</p><br><p>"Let's go! His aura won't touch you! Get to him and stop him! Damn it, there's six of you, he's only one!" Tirana said menacingly, clenching her fist tightly like a belligerent leader.</p><br><p>The Phantoms gulped as they ran after Adam.</p><br><p>Sure, it would be more effective if Tirana and Olax did so, but they had to deal with Adam's Spirit first. They had to suppress Adam's aura so that neither they nor their squad members would take internal damage.</p><br><p>'Adam, be careful, they're surrounding you!' Silvana exclaimed.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, I know." Adam muttered as his gaze became sharper.</p><br><p>The next moment, one of the Phantoms appeared in front of him, aiming its massive spear directly at Adam's chest.</p><br><p>Adam turned his body, allowing the spear to pass right in front of his chest, under his intense cold gaze.</p><br><p>'Good. Those two may be strong, but these are clearly below my level. I can handle them!' Adam inwardly uttered, about to attack the man in front of him. He clenched his fist tightly, bringing it up for a deadly attack.</p><br><p>However... When Adam wanted to unleash his fist on his opponent, he realized he couldn't do it.</p><br><p>Turning around, he saw two Phantoms holding back his arm, while a third was summoning solid roots from the ground, moving towards him, the others ready to attack.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam realized that he might be surrounded since he was alone and the enemy was indeed numerous, but never before had he found himself in a similar situation.</p><br><p>Adam had fought against the Phantoms several times before, it had happened in both - Dead Lands and Fall Hill Prison, but it had never been a 1 vs 6 fight. Even against Mirna, it was a relatively fair 1 vs 1 fight.</p><br><p>It was odd for Adam that two Phantoms at once were used just to stop his hand, instead of being decent, standalone opponents.</p><br><p>However, that didn't take away from the fact that it was effective. Adam was actually unable to move.</p><br><p>Adam only had a few seconds to do something, and oddly enough, he was lucky because his left arm was free.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes shone brightly as silver threads covered his left hand, transforming into a menacing gauntlet of claw-like fingers.</p><br><p>Before the Phantoms could realize anything, Adam's hand thrust into the chest of one of them - the young man, who was holding his wrist with both hands.</p><br><br><p>The young man's eyes went wide as a stream of blood spurted from his mouth, a few drops landing on Adam's face, flying in front of his cold eyes.</p><br><p>"If you were the first, I would question whether it was worth going to such drastic measures, but now I have no doubts." Adam uttered in a wistful voice while dark blood poured down his white gauntlet - the man's organs had already been turned into a bloody mess.</p><br><p>Then, his eyes shifted to the second Phantom - it was a middle-aged woman who stared shocked at him and at her dying comrade.</p><br><p>Adam's hand moved as the tips of his claws glowed brightly - becoming a harbinger of the next death.</p><br><p>Five silver threads, along with a gauntlet, passed through the man's body, tearing it apart only to reach the woman and condemn her to the same fate.</p><br><p>The threads cut her to pieces, limbs, and heads flying off in different directions, coating everything around with crimson liquid.</p><br><br><p>A long spear stabbed into Adam's back, causing his eyes to go wide from the vivid pain that traveled through his entire body.</p><br><p>Before Adam could do anything, a flaming projectile flew into his chest, and a hail of steel needles rained down on him from above.</p><br><p>A massive cloud of dust rose high up, leaving only Adam's silhouette barely recognizable. Not a few seconds later, Adam burst out, running quickly in the direction Silvana indicated.</p><br><p>There was a moderate burn on his chest, trickles of blood flowing down his shoulders, and his back was aching from the deep wound from the spear.</p><br><p>He was in pain, which was clear from his clenched teeth and fiery gaze, but he didn't have time to feel sorry for himself or scream in agony.</p><br><p>It was only two minutes before help arrived, which was the distance the nearest squad that had answered the call was at. However, if Adam ran in their direction, he would cut the time to one minute or less!</p><br><p>"Bastard! You think you can run away after what you did?!" The man exclaimed with a furious look as yellow lightning bolts covered his legs - in some ways, his ability was similar to Adam's one.</p><br><p>The man's lightning bolts didn't speed him up much, however, they allowed him to move in leaps - abruptly disappearing from one place and ending up in another.</p><br><p>"Amplify me! I'll stop him! Do it!" The man ordered, it seemed, that not counting Tirana and Olax, he was the third in charge of their squad.</p><br><p>At the same moment, two Phantoms used their abilities, causing the man's body to flash several times as if they had put a buff on him. It immediately affected his speed and aura.</p><br><p>Then, when the man's foot touched the ground, he disappeared only to show up right in front of Adam, who had only managed to run a few dozen meters in those few seconds of respite.</p><br><p>A long dagger loaded with amber lightning appeared in the man's hands, ready to plunge into Adam's chest in the next blink of an eye.</p><br><p>'Shit! I won't have time to dodge!' Adam's eyes went wide, realizing that the difference in their speed was too great - the best he could do was to summon his needle and try to defend himself at least partially.</p><br><p>Silver threads emerged from the bits of energy trying to turn into a needle, but Adam's time was too short. There was no way he could defend himself.</p><br><p>Then, a snow-white arrow reflected in Adam's eyes, leaving behind a calm plume that exuded power and arrogance.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the arrow plunged precisely into the man's shoulder, severing the hand that held the dagger.</p>
