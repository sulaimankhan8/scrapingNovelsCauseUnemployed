            <br><p>Before the Lords unleashed their attacks on Saegar, a few seconds before, everything had already become obvious to Kenward. He stepped aside, no longer trying to attack the two Ascended Lords who were to become his opponents.</p><br><p>"Wait...! Where are you going?" The man exclaimed, addressing Kenward, who had stopped between the two hovering islands.</p><br><p>Kenward glanced over his shoulder.</p><br><p>"My contribution to the battle is no longer necessary. I know Saegar well... He hates to do this, but your comrades forced him to, leaving him no other choice. So, you can blame only yourselves for what happens next."</p><br><p>At the next shudder, Kenward found himself on the edge of the main island watching as the chains shackled Saegar, holding him under an impenetrable crimson dome. His horse turned back into a scarf, laying across his broad shoulders.</p><br><p>On the other side, Adam and Wilfred watched the events unfold, sitting on the great snake. For Adam, this was something new and beyond his imagination. However, even Wilfred's eyes showed a spark of interest.</p><br><p>"Look closely, Adam. This doesn't happen very often. There's no remarkable difference between the Lesser Lords and the Ascended Lords, but the same can't be said for the True Lords like Saegar and Kenward."</p><br><p>Not that Adam was familiar with those terms yet, still, he realized that Saegar and Kenward were above all other Lords in the land. Otherwise, the Befallen Crown wouldn't need so many Lords to stand a chance against Saegar.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Before the deadly attacks could reach Saegar, electrical discharges passed across the sky, but not the black ones that Saegar usually used.</p><br><p>The light rays of sunlight that were always guests of this land disappeared in an instant, replaced by gray, unfriendly clouds, dark and threatening.</p><br><br><p>The amber thunderbolt rained down on the crimson dome, shattering the impenetrable barrier into tiny fragments, stopping all of the Lords' attacks with its power.</p><br><p>The shockwave spread hundreds of meters around, bending trees and scorching bright fields of flowers around Saegar.</p><br><p>The wind currents reached even Adam, who was only able to hold on to the snake's head thanks to Wilfred, who put his hand on his shoulder in time.</p><br><p>On instinct, the nine Lords bounced aside. Kenex and Horon joined them, going to help them before the unexpected. Serra and the two Lords remaining on the island watched carefully from above, ready to rush into battle if necessary.</p><br><p>Even the islands and chains could not contain their resilience, shaking like boats facing a crushing tsunami.</p><br><p>"This..." Adam gulped, looking at the gray and bleak lands spread out before him. "Once the sun was gone, all the colors faded away."</p><br><p>Wilfred nodded weakly.</p><br><p>"Yeah, that's the reason why he doesn't like to use that power. Even I know that, though I don't work with this guy very often. He's too talkative."</p><br><p>Adam gave him a questioning look.</p><br><br><br><p>At the same moment, the smoke screen dissipated as all eyes returned to Saegar.</p><br><p>There were no wounds on his body, his Arc was still on him, but that didn't matter as much as the great wing of black energy and amber lightning that towered over him, emerging from the left side of his back.</p><br><p>Amber lines like crystals traveled down his arms, legs, and chest, heading toward his eyes. With each surge, only one line carried enough energy to match the strength of a weak Lord.</p><br><p>Adam gasped, staring at Saegar's great wing.</p><br><p>All the other monsters at the Soaring Chain Islands had impressive wings, even the maids who brought Kenward his desserts. Yet only their leader, their Lord, had none.</p><br><p>And even now, Saegar stood proudly with only one wing. However, his lone wing outshone all the others, all the Lords standing before him.</p><br><p>Wilfred exhaled a puff of smoke, finishing his second cigarette, and already reaching out for the next.</p><br><p>"This is a form that only the True Lords possess. Think of it as their unique power that comes with their titles."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam was stumped. "Can't even the Red Threat Monster have a title?"</p><br><p>Wilfred shook his head. "I'm not talking about that title, I'm talking about the Lord Title. The ones that only the True Lords possess.</p><br><p>"Saegar has his title as a strong monster, the Proud Wing, but his Lord Title is different. If you want to know his full name, like some official shit, it would be..."</p><br><p>Wilfred narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>"Saegar, the Proud Wing, Lord of Thunder Amber."</p><br><p>After a few moments, Wilfred added:</p><br><p>"Only the True Lords can have such a name, some of the strongest monsters you can meet in our world. Normally, all Lords keep their full titles a secret from weaker creatures. So, you can only find out about it at times like this if you are not their equal."</p><br><br><p>He couldn't hide his inner excitement. Maybe the situation was not suitable, but he thought about how he, too, would like to have a title for himself.</p><br><p>But he realized that it was still a long way off. He, as Phantom, had to go through many trials on top of the world to earn himself a title.</p><br><p>In some ways, it was easier for the monsters to do so because it was part of their culture as a race. But the Lord Titles were on a whole other level.</p><br><p>'Wait, does that mean Kenward has his Lord Title too?' Adam inwardly muttered, directing his gaze upwards.</p><br><p>Kenward was watching his friend with a calm gaze.</p><br><p>"Agh, it's ironic that his power destroys all the colors and flowers around him, and hides his beloved sun, replacing it with dark clouds. It is in this form that he can show who he really is."</p><br><p>At the same moment, Saegar spread his hands apart as the sky split in two.</p><br><p>Amber lightning bolts rumbled through the dark layer, condensing in his fists.</p><br><p>Two great spears were nearly as large as his wing and found themselves in his tight grip, pulsing aggressively with electrical discharges.</p><br><br><p>Saegar pointed to the upper island where Serra and the two Lords were.</p><br><p>In the blink of an eye, a burst of thunder turned the island into dust.</p>
