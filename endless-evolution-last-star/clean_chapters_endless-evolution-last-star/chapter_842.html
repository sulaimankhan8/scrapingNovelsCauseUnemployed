            <br><p>What Adam was waiting for was finally about to happen - the second keyhole would open, and he would become a K3-Phantom.</p><br><p>All he had to do was to enter the Second Key into the keyhole, and Adam was not going to delay.</p><br><p>He didn't want to think about how much time he spent fighting and connecting all five hundred stars with the blue line. That was in the past - there were new challenges ahead.</p><br><p>Clutching the key's handle tightly, Adam threw it straight to the Lock with all his might. It was impossible to miss, Adam realized that, since the key had only one way out.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree fell silent, eager to capture the fateful moment and prepare for the changes, for they would be more massive than before, but... yet... they would be almost nonexistent.</p><br><br><p>In a blue flash, the Second Key disappeared into the keyhole, sending the first wave of energy through the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>The massive chains emanating from the Lock showed themselves, they braided tightly around the base of the Evolution Tree, preventing it from growing as vigorously as it could.</p><br><p>However, the chains were far fewer than at the beginning of Adam's journey, and another piece was about to disappear.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>With a loud crack echoing through the inner space, cracks ran through the chains and parts of the Lock.</p><br><p>One by one the links shattered into shards, quickly disappearing into the void - they fulfilled their purpose and had no more place in this world.</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree wheezed, energy coursing through every part of its great body.</p><br><p>[Two more steps and... Perhaps we can achieve the impossible for most...]</p><br><p>The tree's cryptic words left Adam baffled. He was curious to understand what the Evolution Tree was saying, but soon he realized he didn't have time for that.</p><br><br><p>With renewed vigor, the Stellar Flow rushed forward, causing Adam to turn around in panic. The Second Key was gone, which meant nothing was stopping the Stellar Flow, it could flow forward and blow away everything in its path.</p><br><p>Adam didn't know what it was, but deep inside, he knew that the Stellar Flow was dangerous, at least for now. Its power was great and could be used to his advantage, just not in such an aggressive and savage way.</p><br><p>[Hehehe... You should have seen your frightened face...]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree's sneer was not what Adam expected. He turned around again, looking sternly at his tree.</p><br><p>"You think this is funny? It won't be a minute before that flow gets to me! You'll be next! This is my space, I feel that neither you nor I are ready to absorb the flow."</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree fell abruptly silent, but not because of Adam's irritation.</p><br><p>Gusts of energy, one after another white ripples ran along the great trunk, reaching the very tips of the branches.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, the pulse from the Second Key was completely absorbed, the Evolution Tree absorbed the initial portion of the energy.</p><br><p>[Yes... Now I can finally feel it...]</p><br><p>"Hey! Do something!" Adam exclaimed, pointing at the Stellar Flow.</p><br><p>There was no more time, they had no plan, they had to act now.</p><br><p>[This took a long time... but... I think your next move will be much faster...]</p><br><p>"Fuck! Can you hear me?!" Adam exclaimed.</p><br><p>The Stellar Flow was behind him, only a few meters away. His heart was beating faster, his mind was in turmoil before disaster struck.</p><br><p>However, the Evolution Tree continued its speech as if it didn't realize how critical the situation was.</p><br><p>[What a pity... That you and me are too weak... For now, we cannot absorb the Stellar Flow...]</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, confusion covered his face, making him forget about the rescue for a second.</p><br><p>"The Stellar Flow...?" he muttered when he heard a rumble behind.</p><br><p>[Indeed... The Stellar Flow... and... they're already here...]</p><br><p>Before Adam could realize what the Evolution Tree was talking about, a bright flash illuminated from above.</p><br><p>Adam reflexively raised his head - the events were happening without his knowledge.</p><br><br><p>A wide white streak reflected in his blue eyes, quickly dividing the dense darkness as if something was striving into his inner space with only one purpose - to save him and point the way to the future.</p><br><p>With a shudder running to the distant boundaries, the massive gates collapsed between Adam and the Stellar Flow.</p><br><p>Streams of wind unusual for inner space, ripped in all directions, fleeing from the gate. Adam had to cover himself with his hand and strengthen his stance to keep the wind from throwing him aside.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Stellar Flow reached the strange gates, crashing down on it with all its might.</p><br><p>It rumbled like thunder throughout the inner space, threatening to stun Adam if he came any closer.</p><br><p>It seemed impossible to stop such a force, but the gates didn't budge.</p><br><p>'Agh...?' Adam stared ahead in disbelief, 'Did it actually help?'</p><br><p>Gradually the noise lessened, the Stellar Flow tried to make its way through the gates, but it proved to be an impossible task.</p><br><p>In less than a minute, the Stellar Flow subsided completely, becoming a calm river instead of a raging waterfall, but the flow retained its intentions - once the gates disappeared it would fall on Adam again.</p><br><p>Seized by the events, Adam gulped, with a secret desire to raise his gaze to take a proper look at the gates.</p><br><p>Although the gates stopped the Stellar Flow, they didn't look sturdy at all. Its frame was transparent with a purple tint like magic glass.</p><br><p>The two main pillars were connected by an archway falling downward. In the center of the arch was an orb, something lurking inside, but impossible to see through the dense crystal layer.</p><br><p>Then, Adam's gaze lowered, revealing that the gates were divided into five smaller ones. Each gate was firmly locked, not with a key, but a seal.</p><br><p>The seals were the same orbs as the main one at the top.</p><br><p>This was the Crystal Gate, the main trial for the K3-Phantom on the way to the K4-Level, the last step before greatness.</p>
