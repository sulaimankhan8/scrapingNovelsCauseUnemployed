            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1199: Bathild, One Without a Title (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>For every creature, absorbing the Twilight Crystal or Midnight Crystal was a great deal. Even if it didn’t allow them to evolve, it always made them a little stronger.</p><br><p>K4-Phantoms like Adam were no exception to this rule. As a human, he couldn’t absorb energy, but the star crystals were special, always pushing his evolution forward.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The black orb shook, directing all its energy straight at Adam.</p><br><p>This Twilight Crystal was supposed to go to the Kirani Queen or some very powerful Kirani Bug, but they couldn’t protect their treasure, so now it would go to their enemy.</p><br><p>Just like last time, Adam found himself in his inner space, right in front of the Path Construct.</p><br><p>The initial star shone brightly, waiting for its next influx of energy.</p><br><br><p>Twilight Crystal: 1/1</p><br><p>Midnight Crystal: 1/1</p><br><p>Dark Heart or Connected Heart: 0/1]</p><br><p>Two of the three conditions had been met.</p><br><p>“Hmm, now I’ve accomplished our mission, haven’t I?”</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam thought that he and Fromund could simply escape from the Corrupted Volcano and return to the Bastion Opard, and from there go to the Citadel.</p><br><p>Sure, there were two more Twilight Crystals at the Kirani Colony, but neither Adam nor Fromund had much use for them. If they absorbed one more Twilight Crystal, they would become a little stronger, but overall, it wouldn’t change anything significantly.</p><br><p>“Tsk, maybe it’s finally time to think about the situation pragmatically?”</p><br><p>Then, he glanced at Fromund, who was waiting for him in the middle of the cave.</p><br><p>“Silvana, what do you think? I mean, Fromund and I got what we came for. We fulfilled the conditions necessary for our initial stars. I don’t know what kind of monster is coming towards us or what the Queen of these bugs wants, but it’s no longer of any value to us, is it?”</p><br><p>Shocked, Silvana blinked several times. She couldn’t believe what she was hearing.</p><br><p>‘Well… I didn’t expect to hear that from you, but if you’re seriously considering this option, then it’s possible. I don’t know what kind of monster is coming, but if you hurry, you might make it…’</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a crushing tremor spread through the Kirani Colony, attracting the attention of not only Adam and Fromund but also hundreds of bugs that scattered in all directions.</p><br><p>Fromund’s eyes widened as blue electrical discharges destroyed the debris.</p><br><p>Something, or rather someone, did not follow Adam and Fromund into the tunnels. The approaching monster decided to take the shortest route, heading straight for the depths of the Kirani Colony.</p><br><br><p>A female figure collapsed to the ground, while Fromund’s eyes caught sight of Bathild’s dark blue hair.</p><br><p>As soon as Bathild looked in his direction, her tail immediately sprang into action.</p><br><p>Before Fromund could react, the sharp tip of the tail slammed into his side. A splash of blood gushed out from the cut as the impact threw Fromund across the cave.</p><br><p>Less than a second later, several clumps of flame flew out of the smoke screen, but Bathild easily dealt with them.</p><br><p>All she had to do was extend her arm forward as electric discharges destroyed Fromund’s attack.</p><br><br><p>Adam frowned, an irritated expression on his face as he emerged from the tunnel he had dug earlier.</p><br><p>The only time he had intended to simply complete the mission and leave the battlefield without fighting every monster in his path, he had failed.</p><br><p>Now that Bathild had appeared, he simply couldn’t leave. However, he hadn’t even seen that it was her yet.</p><br><br><p>He stopped at the edge as his gaze shifted downward.</p><br><br><p>Adam didn’t expect to see Fromund’s blood on the ground, because the mighty monster had appeared only a few seconds ago.</p><br><p>But when his gaze turned to Bathild, his eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br><p>Faster than he could comprehend, his mind created a ghostly copy of the Essence Thunder Demon next to Bathild.</p><br><p>A moment later, the Prime Thunder Demon appeared as well.</p><br><br><p>Adam jumped off the slope, staring intently at Bathild. He couldn’t have been more puzzled and surprised than he was now.</p><br><p>He couldn’t explain this feeling, but it was as if he was looking at the Thunder Demon, only a female and much stronger version of it.</p><br><p>“How strange…” Adam muttered.</p><br><p>This time, his instincts were working. He immediately determined Bathild’s origin, and the lightning bolts wandering across her body were just another clue.</p><br><p>That didn’t mean that Bathild had once been a Thunder Demon, although it was possible, though highly unlikely.</p><br><p>However, Adam was certain that Bathild and the Thunder Demons shared many similar genes.</p><br><p>Their appearance, aura, lightning bolts, two horns, and tail.</p><br><p>Even Bathild’s blue eyes convinced Adam that this was indeed the case. The only notable difference, from his point of view, was the tattoo on Bathild’s chest. The Thunder Demon did not have one.</p><br><p>This was not surprising, considering that Bathild was an Elder, while the Essence Thunder Demon was a Purple Threat Monster, albeit one of the strongest ones.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>Stones flew in all directions as Fromund emerged from the rubble, and Bathild looked at Adam.</p><br><p>She licked her fangs, studying him with the same interest he had for her.</p><br><p>“Well, well. You’re Adam Vinter, right? Although there’s no doubt about that. Your friend uses fire, your abilities are different.”</p><br><p>‘What?’ Adam was caught off guard. ‘She knows my name? No, more importantly, she knows something about my abilities?’</p><br><p>This had never happened before.</p><br><p>Adam was no longer surprised when other Phantoms recognized him. He was a K4-Phantom, so it was to be expected.</p><br><p>But… this was the first time he had received appreciation from a monster.</p><br><p>“What? Are you surprised?” Bathild grinned. “It seems like this is the first time a monster has known you as Phantom, isn’t it?”</p><br><p>Adam had no choice but to nod.</p><br><p>“Yes, what about you? Since you know my name, I would like the same in return.”</p><br><p>Bathild confidently waved her hair.</p><br><p>“Bathild, that’s my name.”</p><br><p>“Your title, I want to hear your title.”</p><br><br><p>“I don’t have a title, yet!”</p><br><p>Adam bowed his head.</p><br><p>“That’s… that’s a shame.”</p>
