            <br><p>High nobles could always rely on their family for help in one way or another. As with security, the status and position of that particular noble in the family didn't matter much.</p><br><p>It was all about reputation as always for Twelve Branches was sacredly important.</p><br><p>Thus, Zarot had every reason to believe that sooner or later Gladius and Xyrea would be in serious trouble for kidnapping him. Moreover, although Zarot was scared, he didn't think that he was going to die.</p><br><p>His death would cause too much publicity and trouble for his assassins and most likely his family's anger would be uncontrollable.</p><br><p>If a member of some great family could be killed by anyone without punishment, it was a very bad sign and a crushing blow to their reputation.</p><br><p>But... a few words were enough to shatter all of Zarot's hopes.</p><br><p>His family decided to kill him. Why did that happen?</p><br><p>Well, because all the rules worked both ways.</p><br><br><p>His face turned as pale as a sheet of paper, a shiver ran through his entire body, with a cold stream, protruding from his forehead.</p><br><p>"What the hell are you talking about monster?! What do you mean by saying I'm dead? I'm still alive and I'm going to live for many, many more years!"</p><br><p>Xyrea didn't bother to argue with him. Instead, like any Operator in her position, she decided to use evidence.</p><br><br><p>With a smooth motion, she pulled the phone out of her coat, deftly tapped the screen a few times, and held out her hand to Zarot. For most monsters, technology was something incomprehensible and complicated, but Xyrea was smart enough that she learned how to use a phone at the level of a skilled Operator faster than most humans.</p><br><p>Many articles by prominent media outlets, especially those influential in the First Ring had appeared before Zarot. All of them were about his death, but... not a single article was published yet.</p><br><p>"As agreed, the articles will be published between 8 and 10 in the morning, which means that in just a few hours, the world will know of your demise."</p><br><p>"But... Why? What's going on here? No... it can't be true..."</p><br><p>Ignoring Zarot's increased despair, Xyrea proceeded to explain.</p><br><p>"Because of your initiative and your son - Nirosh Marzo, The Rule of Power was held and lost on behalf of your family."</p><br><p>After a brief pause, she continued:</p><br><p>"It was not just a fight in some small arena but at the Moon Colosseum, with the testimony of many nobles and Kogen Noukx. Also as far as your family knows Erik Wurhen was there, who is also a highly important person."</p><br><p>Xyrea's gaze grew deeper, looking at Zarot from top to bottom.</p><br><p>Experience tales at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"So your family chose the same punishment for both of you - death, but... due to interference from Adam Vinter, your son was already killed ten days ago."</p><br><p>Zarot's face went dark, and his gaze went blank. However, no one wanted to die and Zarot was no exception.</p><br><p>Gathering his last strength, Zarot clenched his fists tightly and raised his head.</p><br><p>"The articles haven't been released yet. We can still come to an agreement! Please, I'll do anything! There must be some kind of mistake! My family couldn't do such a thing, moreover, who would even believe that I just died?!"</p><br><p>After listening to him carefully, Xyrea tilted her head, her gaze full of confusion.</p><br><p>"I showed you the articles, though... it seems like you were so scared you were only looking at the headlines. Well, it's pretty simple."</p><br><br><p>Xyrea stepped forward and opened one of the articles. They were all slightly different since to ordinary people it should be a sensation, but the point was the same.</p><br><p>"According to the official story, this night you went into the Dead Lands on a dangerous mission. You did it because you wanted to kill a rare monster to honor your son's memory and to cleanse your name and the ruined reputation of your family."</p><br><p>Slowly, Xyrea scrolled down to the article below where the ending of the non-existent story was revealed.</p><br><p>"Eventually, just before dawn, you managed and killed that monster. That's not even a lie, that monster was found and killed a few hours ago by the superior members of the Marzo Family. As a result, you were badly injured and exhausted. Unfortunately, when help arrived, the other monsters had already torn you apart.</p><br><p>By lunchtime today, the Marzo Family will present to the public the parts of the monster you supposedly killed."</p><br><p>Zarot's eyes narrowed as the realization came to him.</p><br><p>Stepping out of the shadows, Gladius tilted his torso to the side, maintaining a malicious smirk.</p><br><p>"Yeah, it was just like that - official."</p><br><p>Now, Zarot fully understood what was going on here, and... everything Xyrea and Gladius said earlier was true.</p><br><p>Thus, the Marzo Family was going to cover up the death of one of their own family. Moreover, such news will only cause the common people to admire and respect Zarot. When people see the remains of the monster he killed and the enthusiastic reviews from the military with the media, it leaves a good memory of Zarot Marzo in people's minds.</p><br><p>For the Marzo Family, it also had its advantages - they would partially restore their reputation after losing The Rule of Power, punish Zarot for his mistake, and show the other high nobles that they knew how to solve problems quickly.</p><br><p>"In general." Gladius hissed like a snake, "Everyone will benefit from this situation. The only one who will have to sacrifice something is you - your life!"</p><br><br><p>Zarot remained silent for a long time, trying to find some way out of his situation.</p><br><p>In the end, he only sighed heavily:</p><br><p>"Agh... Then I want to ask one last question."</p><br><p>Accepting his fate, Zarot glared at Gladius. He lived in this world and noble society long enough to understand that everything was already decided about him.</p><br><p>"Why you? Any stronger Phantom might kill me."</p><br><p>Gladius shrugged taking a few steps back.</p><br><p>"Well, it's all because of my pact with Franz Balo."</p><br><p>"Franz Balo...? I see... It has to do with Nelya, right?"</p><br><p>Gladius nodded approvingly.</p><br><p>"You're right, but... if you're interested in my motive."</p><br><p>Then, Gladius appeared in front of Zarot, his eyes narrowed like crescent moons with a wide demonic grin on his face.</p><br><p>"To be honest - I just love good people!"</p>
