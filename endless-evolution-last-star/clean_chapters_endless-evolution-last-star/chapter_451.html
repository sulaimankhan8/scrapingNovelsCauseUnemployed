            <br><br><p>Adam popped a piece of jerky into his mouth before looking at Osana and asking: "So... Technically, the Twelve Branches control everything in the First Ring, right?"</p><br><br><p>"Yes. As I said before, the First Ring is divided into nine wings. Right now we're in the seventh wing, the main family here is the Wurhen Family."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, a little puzzled.</p><br><p>"The Wurhen Family? Wait... Are they one of the Twelve Branches too?"</p><br><p>Osana smiled bitterly.</p><br><br><p>Adam confused, scratched the back of his head, trying to make sense of the situation.</p><br><p>"I thought all of the Twelve Branches lived in the first wing. I mean, you said that in the First Ring, there are strong differences in wealth between the wings."</p><br><p>Osana nodded deeply, showing that Adam was right.</p><br><p>"That's true. Though it's not quite correct, but the difference between an average family from the first wing and a family from the ninth wing is as big as the difference between a family from the First Ring and a family from the slums."</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, he was outraged when he heard the comparison to the slums, but Osana beat him to it: "I realize this seems strange to you, but you have to understand what I'm talking about. Obviously any family in the First Ring, regardless of the wing, has enough money to live a good, comfortable life, but... there's power besides money."</p><br><p>Adam snorted with a broad sweep of his arm.</p><br><p>"Come on! People in the slums often starve, freeze, and even washing with warm water is a frequent problem! It can't be compared. Sure, I realize there's a difference, but..."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly before continuing: "What does it matter if you have a two-story house or a mansion if you don't have a wealth problem? You have one car or ten. There are necessities like food, water, health, and basic comfort. Everything else is a luxury that people from the First Ring have money for."</p><br><p>Osana did not reply immediately.</p><br><p>She paused for a moment before she nodded lightly.</p><br><p>"Adam, I understand you, I really do and I didn't say that because I wanted to insult you or belittle the hard lives of the people in the slums. It's just... people are insatiable creatures and you don't quite know what you're talking about."</p><br><p>Osana looked away as she muttered:</p><br><p>"Ordinary people in the First Ring also answer to someone and go to work every day to feed themselves. Businessmen and rich families have a lot of money and can afford expensive things."</p><br><p>Then, Osana stared at Adam.</p><br><p>"The nobles already have some power since they own territories, and have connections to politicians, the military, and the Phantoms. And... they're just minnows compared to the Twelve Branches."</p><br><br><p>"Adam, I know what I'm talking about since I am Osana De Rouzet. I am one of them. Money is not a problem for the Twelve Branches, nor is it the main goal. The Twelve Branches seek power, not only in their territories but throughout the Citadel and the Dead Lands."</p><br><p>Adam gave her a questioning look.</p><br><br><p>Osana sighed as she leaned back in her seat.</p><br><p>"You assumed that all Twelve Branches are in the first wing, that's not true. Each of the wings has a family that controls most of the territories. For understanding, the park we walked through, this cafe, and a lot of other things belong to the Wurhen Family."</p><br><br><p>Slowly, he began to realize the extent of power each of the Twelve Branches had.</p><br><p>"In fact, the Twelve Branches' influence is not limited to just by the First Ring or the wings, it extends throughout the Citadel, to the Second and the Third Ring, and even to the Slums."</p><br><p>Osana pointed at Adam as if she knew something of interest to him.</p><br><p>"Yellow Shark, you're familiar with that, aren't you?"</p><br><p>Adam nodded uncertainly. He was confused that Osana had asked him something that only someone like him would know.</p><br><p>"Of course I am... Yellow Shark is the most popular and practically the only normal grocery store in the slums. The prices there are very low and there's at least some choice. However, it's still complete garbage even compared to a normal store from the Third Ring."</p><br><p>Adam's gaze grew a little deeper and darker. He remembered well the hundred times he and his family had come to the Yellow Shark. That store was the best they could count on and in fact, the Yellow Shark saved them many times by providing affordable food, albeit low quality.</p><br><p>"So, the Yellow Shark, all the stores, this whole company, is not owned by some businessman from the slums or the government, but by the Balo Family. They're the main ones in the eighth wing."</p><br><p>A wave of shock came over Adam as his eyes went wide. He realized that for most of his life, his family bought food at the Yellow Shark, bringing a small profit to the Balo Family.</p><br><p>"Fuck! They don't have enough money? Why would they make money from poor people in the slums?!"</p><br><p>Adam thought Osana would agree with him, but instead, she only chuckled.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam was puzzled by this reaction.</p><br><p>Osana shook her head.</p><br><p>"Adam, you might not believe me, but all the stores of the Yellow Shark are operating at either zero profit or a negative one. For the Balo Family, the Yellow Shark is a completely unprofitable company."</p><br><p>With this explanation, Osana only achieved one thing, Adam had more questions. He realized that Osana wasn't lying, but it was strange for him to hear that the Balo Family, one of the Twelve Branches, kept a loss-making company operating in the slums.</p><br><p>Why? Why would they do that?</p><br><p>Adam didn't believe that the members of the Balo Family cared about the people from the slums, so there must be another reason.</p><br><p>Osana smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"As I told you earlier, money isn't the most important thing to the Twelve Branches, especially not something as small as in the slums."</p><br><p>"Wait." Adam held out his hand, "Just explain to me then why they keep the Yellow Shark or why they don't raise prices?"</p><br><p>Osana smiled slyly, leaning her chin on her folded arms.</p><br><p>"It's simple, to them these losses are nothing more than rent for the vast areas in the slums. It doesn't seem to make sense to you, but it does. Any territories are influence, business in such territories is connections and information that can lead to unexpected events."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow as he shook his hand slightly.</p><br><br><p>Osana narrowed her eyes.</p><br><p>"Hmm... What about recruiting young men into your ranks as cheap labor or even finding young men with the Spark to make them your Phantoms. Go ahead and ask, I know a lot...'</p><br><p>Adam internally shook his head.</p><br><p>'Fuck... the Plague Reaper, you couldn't have lost faster? Where did I get myself into because of you? Did I need this headache?' Explore more at empire</p>
