            <br><p>Adam stopped in front of the mirrored barrier, glancing at Erla, who was surrounded by Oskar and Lero, their support and happy smiles.
</p><br><p>"Do you think you acted too harshly? Silvana asked, assuming what Adam was thinking right now.
</p><br><p>Adam shook his head.
</p><br><p>"Nah, I just said what came to mind first. Maybe it was rude, or rather... it was definitely rude, but not that I care much. She made a serious mistake, and under other circumstances, it could have been disastrous. It didn’t happen now, but life is long enough for anything to occur."
</p><br><p>Katrin snorted arrogantly, put her staff on her shoulder, and walked over to Adam.
</p><br><p>She didn’t care at all about Erla’s feelings or the Golden Light Squad in general. She was only here to secure her mission, and... to get some money. After giving Adam 2,000,000 credits, her financial situation became quite unstable.
</p><br><p>Only Osana was left, and... she was in no hurry to comfort Erla. She didn’t show it, but she was furious that Erla had failed at such a simple task.
</p><br><p>’Damn it. They were standing in one spot. You just had to hit that fucking Igno Knight, and that was it. Well, once I get up to K2, I need to leave this squad. These idiots won’t survive for long.’ Osana pondered gnashing her teeth before walking over to Erla.
</p><br><p>"Guys, we still need to break the mirror barrier. Let’s pull ourselves together and finish the mission!" Osana said encouragingly with a bright smile on her face.
</p><br><p>Katrin cast a glance at her. She, as a girl with a difficult temperament, understood what lurked beneath Osana’s mask.
</p><br><p>’Well, well, I don’t know if I’d want to be on the same team with her. She’s willing to adjust to any situation on the one hand but on the other... it’s scary when you don’t realize who’s hiding underneath the mask.’ Katrin mused before casting a glance at Adam.
</p><br><p>She took a few steps and stopped. Her gaze got a little deeper as she realized something.
</p><br><p>’Although, masks don’t work on those who can change much. Adam is clearly not the kind of person who wears masks, but that hasn’t stopped him from changing a lot in a few months. Perhaps he’s just grown up, though?’
</p><br><br><p>After a few minutes, they approached the mirrored barrier, looking up at the larva king.
</p><br><p>"How much time do we have left?" Lero asked nervously, seeing that there were less than a third of the resources left. Just a little more and the larva king would absorb all the prepared resources and the king would be born.
</p><br><p>Oskar smiled broadly.
</p><br><p>"That’s enough, about ten minutes. Thanks to Adam’s quick handling of the Igno Knights we’ve saved a lot of time." Oskar uttered before gripping his sword tightly.
</p><br><p>"Let’s use everything we have on this barrier. I’m sure with our combined efforts we’ll break it down quickly. Furthermore, Adam, your needle can pierce anything, can’t it?" Oskar asked, looking at Adam.
</p><br><p>Adam nodded slowly before his eyes shone brightly, and a silver needle appeared in his hand.
</p><br><p>"Considering Katrin’s enhancement this should be easy. Do some damage, make a simple crack, and I’ll have no trouble breaking it." Adam said calmly, pointing the needle at the barrier and looking intently at the larva king.
</p><br><p>It was obvious that the larva king had sped up considerably since they had come here. The monster seemed to realize that it was running out of time.
</p><br><br><p>"Sure, Lero, help me."
</p><br><p>Lero nodded with sparkling eyes. He pulled out his book, opened it, and muttered something like a young wizard.
</p><br><p>Then, the book shone brightly with scarlet light and a large red magic circle appeared on Oskar’s chest. At the same moment, red waves of energy traveled throughout his body, increasing his overall strength.
</p><br><p>Moreover, Oskar became slightly taller, though without this enhancement he was bigger than most people. His muscles tensed up and his vision became sharper.
</p><br><p>"Hahaha, good, now I just feel invincible." Oskar grinned widely clenching his fist.
</p><br><p>Lero sighed heavily with a satisfied smile on his face. He was the kind of guy who liked to help others, and when he saw that his efforts were doing some good, it made him happy.
</p><br><p>Oskar glanced at Adam, for a moment there was a threat in his gaze and a desire to avenge Erla’s humiliation, but... once Oskar saw the roots wrapped around Adam’s body those thoughts disappeared.
</p><br><p>Explore stories at m,v l’e-m|p| y r
</p><br><p>’Nah, it’s not worth it. It was just a minor conflict, nothing really serious.’ Oskar internally muttered before stepping forward.
</p><br><p>He took a deep breath and raised his sword above his head.
</p><br><p>"I’ll use my Second Order, I think that will be more than enough." Oskar uttered as his eyes flashed with a bright golden light.
</p><br><p>A dense golden energy traveled down his arms, along the sword accumulating on the broad blade. This was different from Oskar’s last attack when he blasted Giant Rogo with the power of light.
</p><br><p>"Alright, time to get this over with already!" Oskar exclaimed bringing his sword down on the mirror barrier with all his might.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The energy of the edge, turned into an additional blade of gold, crashing with the sword into the mirror barrier.
</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes at the bright light that from this distance was as bright as the sun. If Oskar had a little more power, Adam would have had to cover his eyes with his hands to keep them from damage.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The mirrored barrier shuddered, trying to spread the destruction across its entire area, but it was hardly possible.
</p><br><p>Several cracks appeared and with them, a shockwave hit Oskar, throwing him back several meters.
</p><br><p>Oskar’s eyes went wide as the impact plunged him into the wall, but there was no pain on his face, only a satisfied grin, for he knew his job was done.
</p><br><p>The mirror barrier had to use its last defense and now it was Adam’s turn.
</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, about to plunge the needle right into the crack and shatter the barrier.
</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, from the other side of the barrier, where there was only solid stone, a long paw with four sharp claws appeared.
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, in an instant, Adam realized that those claws looked familiar to him.
</p><br><p>Then, before anyone could realize anything, the massive monster tore the mirror barrier apart with its long paws as it walked inside.
</p><br><p>"What...?" Adam muttered in disbelief, as a shiver went through his entire body.
</p><br><p>The monster that burst inside the mirror barrier was a Thunder Demon!
</p><br><br><p>’Wait... Why does it have four horns instead of two? And... Why is its skin so black and completely covered in sharp scales?’ Adam inwardly muttered.
</p><br><p>’Adam!’ Silvana shouted, trying to bring him to his senses, for he didn’t have much time.
</p><br><p>"Sure." Adam nodded, quickly gathering himself before plunging the needle into the barrier.
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the strange Thunder Demon grinned, swiped its tail on the ground, and grabbed the larva king with its tenacious long claws, capable of cutting through any armor.
</p><br><p>Then, while mirror shards flew away from Adam’s needle, Thunder Demon licked his teeth and turned into a blur, disappearing into the dug-out passage with the stolen larva king.</p>
