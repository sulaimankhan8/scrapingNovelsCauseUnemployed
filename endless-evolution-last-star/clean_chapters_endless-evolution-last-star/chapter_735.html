            <br><p>The painful cry of an unfortunate nestling burst from the great eagle’s throat, spreading its agony to every observer of the brutal bloody scene. The Conqueror Flame Raider was himself to blame for what was happening, he acted arrogantly, yet he was not strong enough to defend his right to look down on the others.
</p><br><p>Perhaps if the Dormant Lord wasn’t here, the Conqueror Flame Raider would still be circling above the fortress, firing at defenseless monsters and Phantoms, but luck was clearly not on his side.
</p><br><br><p>The massive wing flew off the ground, half sinking into the sand. For normal monsters, it was a feast, one wing containing enough energy to make a few of them move on to the next stage.
</p><br><p>Yet, for the Dormant Lord, it was useless trash. He needed energy like all creatures, but he would never use a being despised by him as a vessel of energy.
</p><br><p>It was beneath his dignity, his pride, which, unlike the flaming eagle, he was entitled to.
</p><br><p>The Phantoms and monsters merely watched what was happening. They were two warring sides, one attacking and the other defending, but none of that mattered now.
</p><br><p>If the Dormant Lord killed the Conqueror Flame Raider, the balance of power would change drastically. On one side it was good for the Phantoms that one of the four strong monsters would die, but on the other... the speed of this event was too fast.
</p><br><p>Katrin narrowed her eyes, she gripped the hilt of her sword tighter.
</p><br><p>’No, this is not good. The Dormant Lord is too strong. I doubt the Grim Warro or the Silent Droao will compete with him, and unlike the Conqueror Flame Raider, they have no reason to.’
</p><br><br><p>A hard fist slammed into the Conqueror Flame Raider’s back of the neck. With a thud, the eagle’s head crashed into the sand, stunned for a moment.
</p><br><p>The next time the Conqueror Flame Raider opened his eyes, he saw the Dormant Lord towering over him.
</p><br><p>Like many Crown Type monsters, the Dormant Lord was slightly taller than a regular man, compared to the Conqueror Flame Raider, he was no bigger than a mouse in front of a massive wild beast.
</p><br><p>Yet, among the two, he was the hunter and executioner.
</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.
</p><br><p>Broken white lines of dense energy like sharp discharges of thunderbolt covered the Dormant Lord’s right hand, running up along his forearm.
</p><br><p>Horror reflected in the Conqueror Flame Raider’s gaze, he realized it was his last minute, but he went too far to let himself be killed for nothing.
</p><br><br><p>With a profound roar, the Conqueror Flame Raider vigorously flapped his remaining wing, directing all his energy towards the beak. Dense clots of flame emerged from the gaps, rising upwards, preparing for its most powerful and possibly final attack.
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord, as if not noticing the desperate attempts of his enemy, raised his hand up, his palm like a deadly sword.
</p><br><p>The energy quickly traveled forward, forming a long, vibrating blade extending from his palm.
</p><br><p>Soon, the eagle’s next roar reached the ears of the Phantoms and monsters:
</p><br><br><br><p>With a lightning-fast sweep, the Dormant Lord’s hand abruptly descended from its highest point to its lowest, unleashing the full power of its energy in a single moment.
</p><br><p>The Conqueror Flame Raider froze, the flames never quite escaped its beak, it seemed that for the proud eagle, time stopped and that was not far from the truth.
</p><br><p>The snow-white blade traveled along the Conqueror Flame Raider, splitting his body into two equal parts. The blade traveled further, cutting through both the dark sand and the water ring near the walls.
</p><br><br><p>Pieces of rock flew aside, with a dusty explosion a deep depression was left in the sturdy great wall. The wall was able to resist the attack, but it wasn’t even the main target.
</p><br><p>Then, a loud rattle rang out from the two monsters, echoing around.
</p><br><p>A straight black line traveled from the tip of the beak to the tail of the flame bird, the crackling becoming much louder.
</p><br><p>The two halves of the massive body began to slowly separate, the tough hide tearing into shreds, muscles, and tendons trying to hold together, but the slash impacted everything in its path.
</p><br><br><p>With a rumble, cut in two the Conqueror Flame Raider collapsed to the ground, sinking into the dark sand that would become his grave.
</p><br><p>The last clots of flame flickered upwards before scattering in the wind seconds later.
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord’s energy calmed down, but his aura was still as powerful as before, nothing had changed.
</p><br><p>This was important to the Phantoms, as it clarified one simple thing:
</p><br><p>’Bastard... So that’s how real you are, right?’
</p><br><p>Katrin gulped intently, staring at the monster she was about to fight 1 on 1 less than an hour ago.
</p><br><p>’With just one attack, he slashed the Conqueror Flame Raider, the Mid Yellow monster in two, and... judging from his aura, it wasn’t anything special. Moreover...’
</p><br><p>Slowly, she turned her head towards the wall.
</p><br><p>A wide flat cut was visible on the black surface, cracks appeared on the nearby stones but failed to reach the top.
</p><br><p>It was obvious to Katrin and everyone else that if the Dormant Lord wanted to, he could destroy the walls, but... the walls had their own defenders.
</p><br><br><p>Without warning, four archers simultaneously shot at the Dormant Lord. At the last moment, he saw purple arrows coming at him and leaped aside. Stay tuned to NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><br><p>The Dormant Lord’s feet touched the sand as the purple energy tore the Conqueror Flame Raider apart, leaving behind the proud eagle pieces of flesh and a few feathers.
</p><br><p>Blood along with sand poured into the deep craters, trying to drive the Dormant Lord away from the walls.
</p><br><p>Unfortunately for the archers, this was their first, serious mistake.
</p><br><br><p>The Dormant Lord stepped forward, his menacing stride was not going to stop, now his goal was to destroy the wall, and the archers themselves provoked him.
</p><br><br><p>Feeling a slight shiver pass down his back, the Blind Commander’s fingertips twitched.
</p><br><p>With great reluctance, he turned his head towards the northern wall, as if he could see that soon it would be destroyed by the formidable creature.
</p><br><br><p>The Blind Commander let out a heavy wheeze, like an old man who is fed up with his constant problems - he just wants to rest.</p>
