            <br><p>When the Phantom moved into the inner space, the sense of time could change drastically in certain situations.</p><br><p>Ten minutes in the inner space could be equal to just one in the real world, but it was not a rule or a law.</p><br><p>Everything was individual and depended on the Phantom and especially on the situation.</p><br><p>Still, there was a certain limit and Adam had to hurry.</p><br><br><p>Fromund attacked at his top speed, using all the resources of his body and red flame armor.</p><br><p>The cracks in the silver needle grew larger and larger with each Fromund's strike and not a single tremor running through Adam's body from the recoil went unnoticed.</p><br><p>Not just the needle, Adam's entire body was on edge, his flesh and bones while his mind was in a different space altogether.</p><br><p>"Damn it! Adam! You've already lost consciousness! Why do you keep fighting even now?!"</p><br><p>Under Fromund's fiery exclamation, he clenched his spear tighter intending to pierce Adam's chest.</p><br><br><p>Like all times before, the silver needle as the last guardian protected its owner, but... without support, it would soon fall as well.</p><br><p>Many spectators already wanted to shout with joy, while the other half sat with dark, pale faces, realizing that they made the wrong choice.</p><br><p>Erik, who did the major bet, holding his cane tightly, watched the last seconds of the battle with a calm look.</p><br><p>'Well, is this really how it's going to end? It would be a logical, but damn frustrating ending...'</p><br><p>Step. Step. Step. Continue reading stories on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Slowly, and leisurely despite the urgency of the situation, Adam climbed the white steps of the soaring stair.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree led him right up to the Desecrated Sword, the stairs were solid and sturdy, trembling slightly with each of Adam's steps.</p><br><p>"You know... this is my space. I could reach here just through the darkness."</p><br><p>Adam muttered before taking the last step, stopping in front of the Desecrated Sword, the crimson sphere covering was dense and intimidating, the cracks in the snow-white bark looking painful.</p><br><p>[This is also my space... Anyway... I hope you're ready...].</p><br><p>A slight shiver wanted to pass through Adam's body, but... it didn't have time to appear before his calm gaze stopped.</p><br><br><p>[To what lies beneath the sphere... As with everything else, there's more to this Power Gene than just the power of the monster you defeated...]</p><br><p>[The Steel Knight... Imagine what would have happened to him if he had reached your level?]</p><br><p>[If he passed through the same path as you...]</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply. He understood what his Evolution Tree was talking about. The rules were the same for his Nexus, Initial Gene, branches, and other parts of his power - his essence and history left their mark.</p><br><p>"Well... I remember everything... If it wasn't for Zera's enhancement of her ability, I would've definitely lost to the Steel Knight. Although, even then he managed to kill a lot of people and that was just the aftermath of our battle."</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree wanted to say something but stopped when Adam reached his hand forward.</p><br><p>Soon, his fingertips touched the crimson sphere, it shuddered and became harder unwilling to let Adam towards the Desecrated Sword.</p><br><p>"I remember him well... The Steel Knight, he could have killed me back when we first met, when I was a K0-Phantom, but he wouldn't interfere in my fight against the Brass Puppet."</p><br><p>A bitter smile showed up on Adam's face.</p><br><p>"It was nobility, strange respect, and... perhaps that's why he's a Steel Knight?"</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam advanced his hand further, plunging into the crimson orb. The energy swirled in a powerful current trying to throw Adam's arm out, but... what could the energy do?</p><br><p>Everything here belonged to Adam, as it was part of him.</p><br><br><p>Adam clutched the Desecrated Sword tightly, the two blades touching his skin, the left leaving a deep cut, and the right ripping through his flesh like a saw.</p><br><p>Then, he closed his eyes, remembering his fight against Steel Knight in detail. In the fragments of his memories of that day, there were many things he should pay attention to, but... some he would never forget.</p><br><p>The Steel Knight, his right arm raised high like a sword only to melt away after a moment due to the powerful thunderbolt.</p><br><p>"Yeah... Fortitude, speed, and pure spirit power, that's what was always intimidating about you. The creature in armor withstood the lightning strike... without hesitation accepting the sacrifice - all for the sake of victory." Adam sighed heavily.</p><br><p>Sensing the moment came, Adam looked ahead - at Steel Knight who stood alone in the vast darkness. The Evolution Tree, the Vault, the artifact, and his Nexus... gone was anything that would remind Adam of Adam's inner space.</p><br><p>"I'm saying it right, aren't I?"</p><br><br><p>Muffled footsteps echoed aimlessly in the void, bringing Adam closer to the Steel Knight, looking at each other.</p><br><p>There was no response. The Steel Knight couldn't speak, but he didn't use gestures or any sounds.</p><br><p>Rumble. Rumble. Rumble.</p><br><p>Instead, with a rumble from the heavy armor, he only raised one of his long swords high - one precise swing would be enough to split Adam in two.</p><br><p>Instincts told Adam to move back to a safe distance and prepare for battle, but... he didn't take a single step away.</p><br><br><p>Adam shook his head before spreading his arms apart.</p><br><p>"Would you attack an unarmed man?"</p><br><p>The Steel Knight froze in place.</p><br><p>"I know you wouldn't. It doesn't go with your nobility and it wouldn't make a decent fight."</p><br><br><p>The Steel Knight didn't know what to say.</p><br><p>Then, Adam pointed to the second sword of the Steel Knight clutched in his right hand - the one he had lost in the lightning strike as well as his hand.</p><br><p>"In that case... How about you give me a weapon?"</p><br><br><p>Adam took another step forward.</p><br><p>"This power belongs to me. It's time to give it back. Give me a weapon so I can win!"</p><br><p>In the blink of an eye, with a fleeting shudder, crimson energy in a powerful stream covered the Steel Knight, completely obscuring his silhouette and left arm.</p><br><p>But... his right sword came into motion - heading for Adam.</p><br><p>It quickly changed from a simple steel sword into something more complex, with two blades looking exactly like a Desecrated Sword.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, the long sword pierced Adam's chest, passing through his heart.</p><br><p>It was the final victory of the Steel Knight, but not over Adam, but over their joint adversary...</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, streams of crimson energy burst from Adam, engulfing everything around him just as Fromund's bright flames had before.</p>
