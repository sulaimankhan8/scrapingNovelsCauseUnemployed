            <br><p>Oddly enough, not every successful attack brought a fighter closer to victory. If one’s opponent was a decent fighter, he could use the situation to his advantage.
</p><br><p>And, Fromund demonstrated just such an approach.
</p><br><p>He took a considerable risk, for if he made even a momentary mistake, he would not be able to move the tip of Adam’s needle aside in time, the silver blade would pierce his torso, a serious wound that would make it difficult and dangerous to continue the fight.
</p><br><p>But... that was the point: Fromund did the right thing. The one who made the mistake was Adam, he should have acted faster and more accurately, not aiming at such an obvious weak point as the stomach.
</p><br><br><p>A single thought flashed through Adam’s mind, red, violent flames headed straight for him, in a heartbeat burning the air, making the space around Fromund’s fist ripple.
</p><br><p>Then, Adam’s pupils dilated considerably, his heart beating faster as he saw this distinctive scene before him for the second time.
</p><br><p>A strong opponent, a quick attack, and a fist surrounded by red matter, moving straight towards him with the sole purpose - to destroy everything in its path.
</p><br><p>This time, it was a 1 on 1 fight. There was no Osana here who at the cost of her artifact could protect Adam and take the blow for herself.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Adam’s Evolution Tree trembled, but not with fear or elation as it did most of the time.
</p><br><p>The current trembling was like the Evolution Tree was trying to stop something over which it had no direct control.
</p><br><p>There was almost no such thing in Adam’s inner space, after all, the influence of the Evolution Tree extended to anything that was related to energy and Adam’s power.
</p><br><p>But... one object, completely unique, that was created over a long period following Adam’s path, was not on this list.
</p><br><br><p>Its black ground trembled like the calm surface of the water, and this was not an isolated incident. The trembling grew stronger and stronger until the top layer began to warp, straining forward as if someone or something wanted to get out of the First Wall, to get rid of its dungeon.
</p><br><p>Slowly, a black hand showed out, it hurriedly touched everything around it to find a way to escape.
</p><br><p>The hand tried to tear the First Wall apart, but all its attempts were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, it attracted attention that this mysterious creature would try to avoid, but it was already too late.
</p><br><br><p>Two ghastly hands emerged from the First Wall effortlessly tearing its top layer, but these hands had no purpose to break free, on the contrary, they did it only because the inferior creature tried to insult their shared dungeon and the space of the one where their prison resided.
</p><br><p>Without hesitation, the creepy hands tore the dark, weak-looking arm apart, bones and flesh separating from each other under the brute, cruel force.
</p><br><p>Then, dealing with the intruder, the eerie hands returned to the First Wall, not intending to take any more action and waiting patiently for their time.
</p><br><br><p>The surface of the First Wall was damaged well ahead of its time, it was only a few ruptures, but it was enough to release the energy lurking inside.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The First Wall shuddered, recovering quickly, it could not afford to be in a vulnerable state for a single second longer.
</p><br><p>The energy that managed to escape headed for the edges of the inner space, like a few black snowflakes bringing with it not only dead silence and peace but also the memories that once were here.
</p><br><p>Then, the world for Adam seemed to stop.
</p><br><p>In an instant, dozens if not hundreds of silhouettes of the Plague Reaper appeared before him.
</p><br><p>’What? Wait... These are the same defeats when I fought against him...’
</p><br><p>Adam remembered the strange space he found himself in when he returned to the Citadel from the Fume Cathedral with Katrin and Nessa.
</p><br><p>Then, out of his own free will, he’d faced the Plague Reaper time after time, always losing.
</p><br><p>And, now, all those defeats for some reason simultaneously filled his mind, reminding him in moments of what a truly deadly attack in a real fight to the death was supposed to look like.
</p><br><p>’Right... Fromund’s strike is strong, it is indeed dangerous and can hurt me badly, but... This attack can’t kill me.’
</p><br><p>Like a hundred ghosts, Plague Reaper’s silhouettes passed through Adam, disappearing into his mind before Fromund’s fist was to reach its target.
</p><br><p>A slight smile appeared on Gladius’ face, followed by a nod, it seemed he was waiting for something like this to happen, remembering Adam’s gaze after he unleashed his power to suppress Mariel, Zarot, and the other Phantoms.
</p><br><p>’Oh, I didn’t think it would happen so soon. It’s curious, quite curious, his understanding is growing deeper... But, will Fromund be able to respond with something commensurate?’
</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.
</p><br><p>Tilting his torso to the side, to swing his right arm as quickly as possible, Adam’s silver needle emerges between him and Fromund’s flaming fist at the last moment.
</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, the fist shatters the needle into two equal pieces like brittle glass, releasing forward a fiery blast following the momentum of the blow.
</p><br><p>Adam could try to dodge to reduce the damage, even if slightly, but he didn’t even think about it.
</p><br><br><p>Electric shocks with renewed force traveled through Adam’s body as he leaned in, moving forward to Fromund instead of away from him.
</p><br><p>The fiery blast burned his right shoulder and part of his arm up to the elbow, but the bright pain didn’t faze Adam, he’d been ready for it moments ago.
</p><br><br><p>Before Fromund could realize anything, Adam’s legs plunged into his stomach like a thunderous spear.
</p><br><p>The momentum was powerful enough to throw Fromund to the other end of the arena.
</p><br><br><p>Fromund cried out in vivid pain, crashing into the solid rock with his back.

</p><br><p>With an electric shock, Adam ended up in front of Fromund, his silhouette reflected in Fromund’s blue eyes.
</p><br><p>Fromund’s face turned pale and his heart ached with fear.
</p><br><p>Adam’s blue eyes, as blue as his own, were now black, mirroring the depths of the abyss where only calm, noble death could dwell.
</p><br><p>His right fist was already raised to attack, actively trembling unable to contain its power, purple waves passed rapidly along his arm embodying the power of gravity.
</p><br><p>Even though it was early morning, the sun was hurriedly rising to illuminate the land with its silent rays, Fromund saw only darkness.
</p><br><p>As if behind Adam stood someone or something whose power was sufficient to block the light in order to spread its reign of darkness.
</p><br><p>Fromund’s eyes ran from side to side, he felt like in this darkness coming out of nowhere were hidden silhouettes running through the black veil like ghosts, showing their presence but not revealing their faces.
</p><br><p>Adam’s hoarse voice rang out:
</p><br><br><br><p>His fist clenched tighter, muscles tensed and lightning sparked with hundreds of electrical discharges.
</p><br><p>"You wasted your chance."
</p><br><p>Then, Adam’s fist came down on Fromund with all its power, wanting to surpass the Plague Reaper’s attack and Fromund’s flaming blow.</p>
