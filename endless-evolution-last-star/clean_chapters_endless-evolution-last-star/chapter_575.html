            <br><p>The long black car was quickly heading into the ninth wing, passing hundreds of buildings on the wide roads, the shortest route to the First Ring.</p><br><p>Zarot had to quickly order another car where they could all fit, given that Elva, Liv, and Tilda were traveling with them.</p><br><p>But... that wasn't the biggest problem.</p><br><p>Fromund's Nexus case weighed a hell of a lot. The stone covering wasn't just decoration, the entire case was made up of heavy stone. This was very rare, and such cases were almost impossible to find in the Upper Ring.</p><br><p>Moreover, the case itself was large, taking up the entire roof of the car. It was obvious that unlike the Phantoms whose weapons were their First Orders, Fromund had something great and menacing.</p><br><p>"How much time do we have left?" Fromund asked opening a large slice of pizza with his teeth before taking a copious gulp of energy drink.</p><br><p>To put it mildly, it wasn't good eating, especially late at night, but Fromund was a Phantom and he could afford it and he had a really important fight ahead of him. He had to be at his prime to give his best performance and as a result win.</p><br><p>"Thirty minutes, maybe a little bit more. To be honest, because the starting condition of the Moon Colosseum fight is pretty fuzzy, a lot depends on Kogen's will."</p><br><p>Fromund raised an eyebrow while chewing the next slice of pizza, a question read on his face.</p><br><p>Enjoy exclusive adventures from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Kogen Noukx, the head of one of the great families, meaning his status is much higher than mine or Mariel's. However, I can't call him an enemy or a friend, but he's a strange person."</p><br><p>Fromund wiped his mouth with a napkin, took another sip, and looked at Zarot.</p><br><p>"So...? Is this good news or bad news for us?"</p><br><p>Zarot smirked, fingertips touching each other.</p><br><p>"The first one. He likes to watch others fight, that way, even if we're a little late the panic won't rise. After all, no one dares to decide such magnitude until Kogen himself speaks his mind."</p><br><p>Fromund realized that Kogen was someone whose level he was still a long way off, so he didn't focus on that and just shrugged his shoulders.</p><br><p>He already agreed to fight, so it would be a shame for him if he got a technical forfeit just for being a few minutes late. That could actually happen, but everyone realized that the second fighter was on his way.</p><br><p>There was only one fight, it was The Rule of Power, a conflict between great families and a simple Phantom, no one would want to lose such a spectacle because of some rules.</p><br><p>"How delicious... I've never eaten anything like this." Elva muttered staring at the large piece of meat, with clear layers of fat looking like marble.</p><br><p>She slowly ate piece by piece, dipping it in a white sauce filled with blue, salty cheese.</p><br><p>Given the restaurants that were open and on their way, Fromund could order whatever food was available, but none of that interested him.</p><br><p>He needed to build up his energy and strength, and ordinary, fatty, and unhealthy food was perfect for that.</p><br><p>But, Fromund wouldn't let Elva, Liv, and Tilda eat pizzas and burgers again. Because of his conditions, Mariel had to pick something for the girls to eat that would excite them, each had different tastes and limited experience, so it wasn't an easy task.</p><br><p>In the corner of the car sat Nirosh, his arms crossed over his chest and his gaze directed out the window. Oddly enough, he wasn't happy with the situation, as although Fromund was his fighter, Nirosh wasn't involved in any way.</p><br><p>'Fuck... There's just nothing depending on me and why did father even agree to take these brats along with us?' Nirosh cast an annoyed glance at Elva, Liv, and Tilda.</p><br><p>'Just look at them, their eyes shining from a simple piece of meat and fish, what will happen to them if they end up at the Red Feast? Will they die of happiness? Pffffff, that's just pathetic.' Nirosh inwardly muttered with disgust on his face.</p><br><p>However... no one was interested in his reaction or opinion. He clearly felt that, so he didn't say anything out loud and continued to stare out the window.</p><br><p>Then, he realized how he felt causing his eyes to go wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>In the reflection, he saw Osana, since like him now, no one listened to her and her wishes didn't matter.</p><br><br><p>Nirosh clenched his fist tightly, gritting his teeth with anger in his eyes.</p><br><p>'Even though everything was against her, she still managed to find a way to escape her fate. Though, no... it's not her or The Rule of Power's fault, it's an ancient law, there's nothing we can do against it.'</p><br><p>Nirosh narrowed his eyes as if trying to see something in the rapidly passing urban landscape beyond the road.</p><br><p>'However, he... Adam Vinter, shouldn't be involved in this. He's just an ordinary Phantom, not a nobleman or a member of the Big Three. Fuck, he just decided to help Osana and it came to this? Why am I so unlucky!?!!'</p><br><p>It seemed like no one noticed Nirosh's inner monologue since people couldn't read minds, but from time to time, Fromund cast a glance at Nirosh.</p><br><p>From the changes in his facial expressions and body movements, Fromund could sense Nirosh's displeasure.</p><br><p>'Agh, he was born a high nobleman, became a Natural Phantom by some miracle, and lived in luxury above 90% of people all his life. Yet, he's still displeased about something.'</p><br><p>Fromund shook his head.</p><br><p>'Some people need too much to be happy, they want everything they can think of, but is that possible? Happiness is in simplicity since if you strive for perfection forever, following your desires you'll never reach the finish line.'</p><br><br><p>Fromund tore off a large piece of meat, looking at the entrance to the ninth wing in the distance.</p><br><p>'Adam Vinter, I hope you're not like Nirosh, or our fight will end too fast.'</p>
