            <br><p>A man like Douglas could easily solve all of Silvana's problems and it was all his idea.</p><br><p>Ceska and Evor were rich enough as high-level Operator &amp; Phantom to just give Silvana the right amount of money.</p><br><p>However, Douglas was not comfortable with that option. He wanted Ceska and Evor to accomplish a difficult mission and to make Silvana a decent Operator, for that she should believe that this was her only chance.</p><br><p>Well, Douglas achieved his goals as always.</p><br><p>A few months later, Silvana left school, passed the entrance exams, and entered the Operator Academy the following academic year.</p><br><p>Academies did not work like institutes or other educational facilities. Academies combined everything at once.</p><br><p>That is, if a normal person as a child went to kindergarten, then to school, and after school went to the institute to get a profession, but in the Academy this path was passed at one time in one place.</p><br><p>In fact, someone like Trici who was already 8 years old and now could enter the Academy, didn't immediately learn how to become a Blacksmith. She would go through the basic classes like other kids her age, but all the classes in each year were modified and designed specifically so that many years later the output would be a decent Blacksmith.</p><br><p>Also, the Academies were separate mini-cities, with everything necessary for life there, from training buildings to dormitories, to restaurants, stores, and various entertainment.</p><br><p>However, everything that happens in the Academies during the first six years of education is just preparation for the period from 14 to 18 years of age. Then the lessons become much harder and complex, and if a student fails an exam, he or she is simply expelled from the Academy.</p><br><p>Thus, Silvana, who only now decided to enter the Academy, had to not only pass the difficult entrance exams but also quickly get used to the life that for others has long been the standard.</p><br><p>However, this was not a problem for her, she knew very well what to expect. From then on, Silvana's education at the Operator Academy began.</p><br><p>And... for Adam, it was the most boring part of her memories. He never studied anywhere and he didn't have the same opportunity as other children: to go to school or institute.</p><br><p>For several years, he watched Silvana's quiet, routine school life as she studied hard, took top-grade exams, and occasionally took time to rest.</p><br><p>Her parents came to visit her once every two weeks, most often both Aton and Matra. In the first year, the relationship between Silvana and Aton remained cold and rigid.</p><br><p>She couldn't forgive him for refusing to help her when he had the chance, for not accepting her wishes and dreams.</p><br><p>However, Aton was not about to give up his role as a father because of one conflict, albeit a very serious one.</p><br><p>Their relationship remained strained for a long time, but gradually Aton accepted that Silvana had already chosen her path.</p><br><p>A few apologies and serious conversations led to their relationship returning to normal, but Aton still didn't hide the fact that he didn't support the work related to the Dead Lands.</p><br><br><p>Silvana sighed heavily as she prepared for her final exam. She had turned 18 a few months ago, she was already in her final year of school, but even after the final exam, she still had an internship waiting for her before she could work at Fort Norton.</p><br><p>"Honestly didn't think I'd end up here... Hah, just to think, I'll be an Operator soon. I wonder what kind of Phantom I'll have?"</p><br><p>A gleam showed in her eyes as several preferred images appeared in her mind.</p><br><p>"Hopefully it would be someone intelligent, with a sharp mind and a calm calculating nature. We as similar personalities would make a great pair. Well... If I get an overbearing and harsh Phantom who won't obey my instructions... that would be too bad."</p><br><p>Enjoy new chapters from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Standing against the wall Adam raised an eyebrow with an indignant expression.</p><br><p>"Hey, that actually sounds offensive, you know?"</p><br><p>"Although... I can understand you. The idea of your partner being a lot like you always seems like a great idea."</p><br><br><p>The final exam was very difficult and long, but to an outsider like Adam, it was nothing unique.</p><br><p>He saw Silvana pass the exam, complete the internship, and begin working at Fort Norton.</p><br><br><p>Heavy footsteps sounded from outside as Douglas approached Silvana. He stood next to her workplace and patted her on the shoulder.</p><br><p>"Well, well, it's only been a few days and you're already here." Douglas smiled widely, looking not at a teenage girl but a grown lady.</p><br><p>Silvana slowly turned around, with a strange expression.</p><br><p>"Hmm...? What are you talking about? It's been several years since we first met. All this time, I've been studying at the Operator Academy."</p><br><p>"Sure, sure, it's just like you said." Douglas shrugged nonchalantly, "Well, I hope you get the hang of it quickly."</p><br><p>After saying just a few words Douglas was about to leave, a confused Silvana shook her head and stopped him at the last moment with a tug on his sleeve.</p><br><p>"Wait..." Silvana muttered with a slightly sad look.</p><br><p>Douglas gave her a questioning face.</p><br><p>Lowering her head, Silvana's lips quivered:</p><br><p>"When can I get my Phantom...?"</p><br><p>"I see... Well, once you prove yourself a worthy Operator, I'm sure it won't take long, and then... it all depends on luck. I don't think you'll have to wait too long."</p><br><p>A few months later, Silvana had completed several dozen missions as an Operator for K0-Phantom groups and now some Phantom could choose her.</p><br><p>As time passed, Silvana did her job, taking the tasks with full dedication and seriousness. However, every day she wondered when she would become a real Operator, when she would get a Phantom.</p><br><p>Then, just under a year ago from the present, Douglas brought a strange young man without NEP who was different from the others.</p><br><br><p>A few minutes after that, a notification arrived on Silvana's phone.</p><br><p>'Hmm? Why not on the computer...? How strange.' Silvana thought before looking at the message.</p><br><p>[Operator Silvana Desio, you have been selected by Adam Vinter, ******* Phantom. Proceed to the designated room to access information that should be off-limits to you. Under the circumstances, you have authorization.]</p>
