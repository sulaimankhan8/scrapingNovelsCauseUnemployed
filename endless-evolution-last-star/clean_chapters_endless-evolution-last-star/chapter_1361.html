            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1361: Wyvern Hunt</strong></p><br><p>With a bright flash, the Azure Wyvern spread its wings wide, as frosty streams spread out in all directions.</p><br><p>Not only was the Azure Wyvern stronger than the Silver Gargoyle and Crystal Golem, but it had also obtained its maximum possible power from the very beginning. The Silver Beacon had put everything she had into it.</p><br><p>If Adam passed the third trial, he would reach the very top, climb the tower, and ultimately reach the glass sphere where she was waiting for him. All that separated Adam from this was defeating the Azure Wyvern and destroying the red heart, protected not only by chains but by a thick layer of ice from an ancient glacier.</p><br><br><p>Adam waved his hand as the Dual Demon Sword appeared in his hand, and blue lightning ran through his body, forming an exoskeleton.</p><br><p>Sure, he could use the second form, black lightning, but that side of the sword required much more strength from him.</p><br><p>At the second trial, the fact that he flew above the ground and gained the ability to destroy the glass cannons guaranteed him victory, but now he did not know what dangers the third trial had in store for him.</p><br><p>“Alright, let’s see what this guard is capable of. Silvana, what do you think? What should I pay attention to first?”</p><br><p>As always, Adam, as a contender, had two paths to victory: either destroy the guard and calmly find a solution to the problem, or fulfill the condition to move on as he did in the first trial.</p><br><p>‘Hmm. I don’t see this monster rushing to act. Also… I don’t think you’ll be able to break through this ice with anything to get to the heart, most likely even the Imaginary Cut won’t be effective enough.’</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply. From previous trials, he understood that the main objects on which the trials were based were really strong, only the glass cannons were an exception.</p><br><p>‘We don’t stand a chance against the guard, not after it received three Silver Wing Signs, but we can find the trial item like in the first trial.’</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam nodded deeply as he looked around.</p><br><p>Even though the Azure Wyvern had already gained its power and settled on the edge of the fortress as it had at the very beginning, no one was rushing to attack. It seemed that while Adam was thinking about a plan of action, the Azure Wyvern was doing the same, instead of blindly rushing into battle as the Crystal Golem had done.</p><br><p>‘Damn, there’s nothing remarkable here…’ Adam muttered inwardly, looking at the countless icy peaks and common wyverns on them.</p><br><p>‘Maybe the trial item is in one of the peaks? No, that would be too easy. I don’t know who created these trials, but even if it was the Silver Beacon, she wouldn’t make such a mistake.’</p><br><p>However, the Azure Wyvern wasn’t going to wait that long. Its patience had come to an end.</p><br><p>“Agh…?” Adam looked up as a bright flash reflected in his eyes.</p><br><p>In an instant, a frozen ray shot out of the Azure Wyvern’s jaw, cutting through the wind. It was a fast attack, more like a shot from a new, high-speed rail gun than a slow but destructive spell.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s frame shook as he disappeared with a flash of lightning, appearing on the nearest icy peak.</p><br><p>The frozen ray reached the ground, shaking the space with a deafening explosion, while a thick layer of ice, like a growing web, covered part of the dark bridge, which turned out to be surprisingly sturdy.</p><br><p>Adam gulped, realizing that if the frozen ray had hit him directly, he would have been left with serious injuries at best.</p><br><p>Still… a satisfied smirk soon appeared on his face.</p><br><p>‘Hah, but no one is stopping me from just continuing to dodge. The gargoyle at the first trial spent a lot of energy on its shots. I can do the same here, right? When this wyvern gets tired, I’ll have time to find the weapon.’</p><br><p>However, the Azure Wyvern understood Adam’s plan well. It was not going to waste its energy on ineffective shots, because it had servants just like the Silver Gargoyle.</p><br><br><p>The Azure Wyvern’s rumble attracted the attention of the other wyverns, who had previously only glanced at Adam from time to time. They had been in no hurry to join the battle, but now they had no choice.</p><br><br><p>Several wyverns flew up and began circling above Adam, the shadows of their wide-open wings running across him.</p><br><p>Then, these wyverns simultaneously descended, crashing into Adam at high speed.</p><br><p>‘What the hell?’ Adam exclaimed internally as he jumped to the side.</p><br><p>But, before he could land on the nearest ice peak, one wyvern flew up behind him, preparing to fire a frost projectile.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened as he swung his sword as fast and as hard as he could.</p><br><p>The thunderbolt struck the wyvern, instantly killing the monster.</p><br><p>However, this was enough time for the others to surround Adam like a menacing swarm, flapping their wings and aiming at only one target — him.</p><br><p>Before the wyverns could fire, Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, he flew out, leaving behind a trail of dark lightning as two wings unfolded on his back.</p><br><p>“Agh… Agh… Agh…” Adam breathed heavily as the wyverns below spread out across the area while the Azure Wyvern continued to watch him closely, wanting to trap him as its prey.</p><br><p>‘This is bad. Maybe I can use threads against them? No, I doubt they will be able to cut them if the gargoyles were capable of it. Then… What do I have left?’</p><br><p>He looked at the Azure Wyvern before turning his gaze to the red heart, which, regardless of the stage of the battle, continued to beat actively, spreading a terrifying aura.</p><br><p>If Adam couldn’t find a way to destroy the red heart or defeat the Azure Wyvern, he wouldn’t be able to pass the third trial and discover what the dark fragments were hiding.</p><br><p>Adam glanced at his right arm.</p><br><p>‘Maybe it’s time to use my Nexus at full power?’</p><br><br><p>‘No, it’s too risky. I’ve never used the fifth ring before, and I’m not sure it will bring me victory right away.’</p><br><p>If Adam had the opportunity, he would have continued to ponder, but he simply didn’t have the time.</p><br><br><p>Dozens of wyverns took flight as the Azure Wyvern spread its wings wide, sending icy gusts of wind straight at Adam.</p><br><p>Several dense ice crystals appeared in the air around Adam, obscuring the movements of the wyverns, which were increasing in number by the second.</p><br><p>In an instant, sharp claws tore into Adam’s back, leaving three long cuts.</p><br><p>“GHA!” Adam cried out in pain and immediately took a defensive stance, holding his sword tightly with both hands.</p><br><p>Clash. Clash. Clash.</p><br><p>One skirmish after another, Adam blocked the attacks of the ice monsters from time to time, but the stronger the wind currents from the Azure Wyvern, the ice crystals, and the wyverns themselves became, the more difficult it was for Adam to hold his position.</p><br><p>He looked around in an attempt to find where the trial item might be, but each glance cost him a new wound.</p><br><p>‘Shit! Shit! Shit! There are too many of them! I can’t do anything!’ Adam exclaimed inwardly as his sword slashed into the claws of one of the wyverns.</p><br><p>The monster flapped its wings and threw Adam aside as he jumped back to get away from them.</p><br><p>However, as soon as the distance between him and the wyverns increased, they rushed towards him in a single stream. Their bright, deep eyes stared at him intently as if he were their next victim, while their leader helped them from afar.</p><br><p>It was at that moment that Adam saw an opportunity.</p><br><p>“Now!” he exclaimed with wide eyes. “Silvana, we have to use the Imaginary Cut!”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, for the first time, he heard a response other than complete readiness:</p><br><br><p>“Agh? What do you mean? Damn it, Silvana, this is no time for jokes! They’ll tear me to pieces if they get to me! Right now, we can kill more than ten, just like we did with the gargoyles!”</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply as she appeared next to him in her spectral form.</p><br><p>But, instead of creating the outline of scissors, she touched Adam’s left wrist and directed his hand upward.</p><br><p>“When I was finishing restructuring your Energy Axis, I learned something… I haven’t shown it to you yet, but I think this is the right moment for you to see the new power, our power,” Silvana said as her eyes became deep and cold, showing the wyverns that neither she nor Adam was ever prey in their hunt.</p><br><p>Before Adam could understand the meaning behind Silvana’s words, he saw it with his own eyes.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>From the white energy, like a myriad of intertwined threads, a great spear appeared in his hand, its tip burning in purple flame while a golden trail emerged from the end.</p><br><p>“Go, Adam.” Silvana hugged him from behind, piercing the wyverns with her gaze. “It’s time to start hunting monsters, right in the sky!”</p><br><p>Adam had too little time to ask Silvana the many questions he had, let alone get answers to them, but he could definitely make one throw.</p><br><p>“Nah, I don’t know what’s going on here, but I like it!” Adam exclaimed before throwing the spear straight into the group of wyverns chasing him.</p><br><p>For him, this would be the first step to victory, but the Azure Wyvern was not ready to lose. It watched and knew what to do so that Adam could never destroy the red heart.</p>
