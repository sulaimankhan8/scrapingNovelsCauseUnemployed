            <br><p>"Thank you for choosing us!"</p><br><p>"Here's your order!"</p><br><br><p>"Hope you enjoy it!"</p><br><p>"Order from us again! Our regular customers get a 5% discount!"</p><br><p>Every five to ten minutes, couriers came to Silvana's door. They were all doing the same task - bringing burgers to her house, more and more, as well as some sodas to drink with it all.</p><br><p>After about an hour, when the last courier left them having delivered the longest order, Silvana closed the door and took a deep breath, not believing what had just happened.</p><br><p>"Agh... This is something I didn't expect at all. Damn... we took couriers for an hour... How much money did Adam spend on this? That's so reckless, but..."</p><br><p>Silvana muttered before turning towards the kitchen. On the table was a whole mountain of paper boxes, inside each one was a burger, the flavors, sizes, and recipes were all different, or at least had an idea.</p><br><p>Adam carefully laid out the burgers forming a tower out of them, he tried to make it as tall and stable as possible.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, damn, Adam, you're like a child. You can't play with food!" Silvana uttered putting her hands at her sides, partly her voice was joyful and partly stern.</p><br><p>Adam shrugged, looking at her confused as if he didn't think he did anything wrong.</p><br><p>"Hey, don't say I don't respect food!" Adam waved his hand with a slight frown, "I'm from the slums, you know? If something was edible, we ate it. If I ever have to throw away even a piece of bread, I'll be depressed for a week."</p><br><p>Silvana was caught off guard, she hadn't expected Adam to react this way and even felt a little guilty.</p><br><p>"More to the point." Adam glanced at the tower he built, "I'm using boxes, not burgers, I wouldn't do anything like that with them since they have one purpose, to be eaten."</p><br><p>Silvana nodded with an uncertain smile on his face.</p><br><p>"I see... So, do we have a list of the burgers we ordered? I'd like to try something unusual first."</p><br><p>Adam nodded and handed her his phone.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, something managed to catch Silvana's eye. The place she'd ordered burgers from earlier didn't have anything like this: "Burger with black bun, pickled sour cherry, blue cheese, hard cheese, white sauce, fresh lettuce, and double patty..." Silvana gulped as she drooled.</p><br><p>Obviously, this wasn't a standard recipe, but calling it the most extravagant wouldn't get it right either, it was something in between while remaining interesting, especially for Silvana who had never tried such a thing.</p><br><p>Well, for him burgers with this kind of filling would be new to him as well, but that wasn't what his attention was focused on right now. He wasn't thinking about the burgers and their flavors, but about making Silvana feel good and having a good time.</p><br><p>With such pure intentions, Adam hadn't dealt with it yet, but...</p><br><p>It revived in him a pleasant, incomparable warmth, bringing a happy smile to his face that cleared his mind with a bright light.</p><br><br><p>The light had an opposite - darkness, and right now, the darkness was facing two ordinary humans, in exoskeletons, armed with False Nexuses.</p><br><br><p>Sano attacked the Shadow mercilessly, breaking its spikes with her powerful fists. She was active and brutal, trying to land as many blows as possible in a short amount of time.</p><br><p>Some parts of her exoskeleton were steaming as she used a mode that allowed her to move faster.</p><br><p>Natta had a different tactic, but it was all part of their calibrated teamwork.</p><br><p>They knew that the Shadow had poor defense, but good speed, and reflexes, and most importantly, the Shadow had dangerous abilities and deadly attacks.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Blue lines filled with energy ran through Natta's exoskeleton. This mode didn't speed her up like Sano or allow her to rain down a hail of blows on her enemy, but... it was capable of bringing destruction.</p><br><p>The energy traveled towards her gloves, concentrating in one small spot. It was hazardous, for the sake of great power in one point, Natta was temporarily sacrificing the other advantages of her exoskeleton, but she trusted her partner completely.</p><br><p>Natta glanced at Sano, who was attacking the Shadow as fast as she could.</p><br><p>'Good, I think we can do it even faster than 70 seconds. During my time in the military department, I've only been given the opportunity to fight monsters a few times.'</p><br><p>Natta pondered for a moment before stepping forward, ending up right next to the Shadow's back. The curved and elongated monster's body was reflected in her eyes, as were the dense layers of intertwined spiky branches.</p><br><p>'There were no exoskeletons back then, at least the military hadn't officially gotten them into service yet.'</p><br><p>Natta stretched out her arms, her left hand grasping her wrist while opening the palm of her right hand as if she were ready to fire from a cannon.</p><br><p>'But... once I started working for that bastard, we've been fighting and killing someone every now and then. It's not always monsters, but it just adds variety and interest. Fuck, I love working here! In this fucking place!'</p><br><p>Then, Natta's calm expression disappeared, it came off like the mask she'd been wearing all along, revealing a crazed grin and a gaze filled with bloodlust. Stay connected through empire</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Her right hand trembled as the energy reached its peak.</p><br><p>A bright blue flash like a tiny star appeared in front of her palm before bursting out, illuminating the chamber for a moment.</p><br><p>Aiden nodded slightly, evaluating Sano and Natta's actions.</p><br><p>'Those two make mistakes, but during a battle, they are some of the best among the commoners. Well, if they didn't end up here, they would definitely be imprisoned by now because of their inner desires.'</p><br><p>Aiden pondered watching as the blue sphere reached the Shadow's back in a heartbeat like a falling comet before expanding in an explosion, releasing all of its energy.</p><br><p>It was a charge comparable in power to the massive cannons that could easily seriously injure a mere White Threat monster.</p>
