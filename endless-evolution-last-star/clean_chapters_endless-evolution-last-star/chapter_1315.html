            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1315: Energy Axis (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Adam woke up in an unknown place, encountered an unknown problem in his inner space, and met two monsters unknown to him that behaved so strangely as if they were doing it on purpose.</p><br><p>It seemed that nothing good could come of such a situation.</p><br><p>“Damn, this is really delicious!” Adam exclaimed, twirling a wide pasta covered in white sauce and topped with hard, salty cheese onto his fork.</p><br><p>“Of course it is,” Misty replied calmly, slowly eating her portion.</p><br><p>Karso put his plate aside and took another one, his third helping.</p><br><p>“Every time we cook something, it turns into a black hole that devours all our time. But…” Karso smiled foolishly, licking his lips in anticipation. “When everything is ready, you can indulge yourself in anything.”</p><br><p>A few moments later, Misty got up and headed to the corner of the kitchen where everything needed to make coffee was located.</p><br><p>If you didn’t count the fact that the coffee shops in the Citadel had various coffee machines and equipment to help with this ancient process, Mitsy’s set would be the envy of any place, both in terms of aesthetics and appearance, as well as functionality.</p><br><p>“Adam, would you like some coffee?” She asked calmly.</p><br><p>They didn’t have electricity, but energy crystals could easily replace fire or cold if necessary. In fact, for monsters of this level, it was not a problem to obtain the technology used by humans.</p><br><p>Electricity and simple devices were an easy task, but few were interested enough to seriously pursue it.</p><br><br><p>Adam didn’t know why, but when Misty and Karso invited him to the table to share their dinner, his initial discomfort quickly evaporated. They behaved not like frightening monsters, but like good friends and long-time comrades-in-arms, and they didn’t mind letting Adam into their circle while they shared the same company.</p><br><p>However, Adam was not going to let that make him lose his vigilance. He still didn’t know where he was or what was going on here.</p><br><p>Perhaps hunger had a strong influence on his decision, because he hadn’t eaten for a whole month, and less than half an hour had passed before his desire to eat something became impossible to ignore, especially when faced with the aroma coming from the kitchen.</p><br><p>“So…” Karso began, throwing his arm over the back of a chair. “How are you feeling?”</p><br><p>Adam rubbed the back of his neck. “Well, not bad, but…”</p><br><p>“You’re a lot weaker than you expected, right?” Karso suggested before Adam had a chance to explain.</p><br><p>Adam blinked several times, looking at Karso’s relaxed expression.</p><br><p>“How do you know that?”</p><br><p>“Well, any monster strong enough to have watched your fight against Ureyn would have realized that you’ve reached your limit as a creature,” he replied casually, as if it weren’t a big deal, even though it sounded quite the opposite.</p><br><p>A few moments later, Misty returned with three cups of coffee on the table. She made herself a small, strong one, while Karso got a massive cup with cream and caramel.</p><br><p>“That’s why you can’t absorb the energy you got from Ureyn,” she continued Karso’s thought while he started drinking his coffee.</p><br><p>“It’s no surprise, we can see it in your aura, as well as in your reactions to our questions.”</p><br><p>The situation was developing faster than he had expected, so Adam decided to take a chance and ask directly:</p><br><p>“The line in my inner space, what is it? As soon as I touched Ureyn’s energy from the Connected Heart, I saw it immediately.”</p><br><p>Karso raised an eyebrow as he exchanged glances with Misty.</p><br><p>“Oh, so you’ve already been able to see it. Not bad, not bad at all.” Karso patted him on the shoulder. “I thought we’d have to explain everything to you. By the way, it only took you a month to recover. You really do have a strong body.”</p><br><p>“Only a month?” Adam frowned. “I’ve never spent that little time recovering!”</p><br><p>“Hahaha, because you were weak!” Karso waved his hand with a bright laugh. “Imagine if you, as a K3-Phantom, had been next to your current self and Ureyn during your fight. You would have been torn to pieces because of how much energy you used! Your ability, that sword and lightning, it practically drained your body even though you didn’t realize it.”</p><br><p>Adam didn’t respond because the Evolution Tree had told him the same thing, only in different words.</p><br><p>This led him to several thoughts, not the best ones.</p><br><p>“Hmm, how strange,” he muttered to himself, remembering his battle. “I was surprised that I didn’t feel any recoil or energy drain when using the Dual Demon Sword, but in the end, I encountered the most powerful recoil of my entire journey.</p><br><p>‘Well, it seems that my strength also affects this. The stronger I become, the more time I will need to recover. Although it may just be a unique case and that’s all.’</p><br><p>Adam could think as much as he wanted, but all his thoughts ended at the mysterious line floating in the middle of his inner space.</p><br><p>And, to some extent, he was lucky because there were two beings next to him who knew much more about it than he did.</p><br><p>“This line, what is it?”</p><br><p>Misty took a sip of her black coffee.</p><br><p>“It’s the Energy Axis. As the name suggests, it shows the state of your energy, and most often it reflects your power as well.”</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head in confusion. It wasn’t that he had never heard the term before. He was prepared for that, but he didn’t hear anything remarkable in Misty’s explanation.</p><br><p>“Wait, I don’t quite understand one thing. Doesn’t the Evolution Tree do the same thing?”</p><br><p>“No. That’s a very silly statement on your part.” Misty replied sharply, her gaze becoming colder, causing Adam to shiver.</p><br><br><p>Karso’s palm fell on Adam’s back.</p><br><p>“Don’t listen to her, there’s nothing strange about you not understanding it the first time. You see, the Evolution Tree stores your energy, that is, it is an indicator of your pure power, while the Energy Axis indicates the state of your energy regardless of its quantity and density.”</p><br><p>Suddenly, even Karso’s gaze became darker and his voice lower.</p><br><p>“Unfortunately, if you don’t rebuild it, you won’t be able to become stronger. At all.”</p>
