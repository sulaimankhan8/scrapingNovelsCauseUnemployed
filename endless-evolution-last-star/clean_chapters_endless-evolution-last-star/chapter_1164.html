            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1164: Zero Vault</strong></p><br><br><p>It was the most secure and important vault in the Citadel. It was here that everything humanity might need in the first years after the World Wipe was stored. In addition, many valuable items were inaccessible even to K3-Phantoms.</p><br><p>The level of security and the seriousness of everyone who worked at the Zero Day Vault were at their highest. Not counting Heaven Island, where Queen Elisa was located, this was perhaps the most important place in the entire Citadel.</p><br><br><p>Two figures walked down a long corridor, one of them carrying an extra-large strawberry milkshake. The slurping sounds echoed off the bare walls, coming from the straw clenched between Damien’s teeth.</p><br><p>“Agh, there’s nothing better than a refreshing drink!”</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow. He felt uncomfortable. He understood the importance of this place. Even with Damien by his side, they had to pass through several barriers guarded by members of the Gamma Division.</p><br><p>“What?” Damien turned to him, puzzled.</p><br><p>“Just… I don’t think I could come here with a cocktail or a burger in my hands.”</p><br><p>“Hahaha!” Damien laughed uncontrollably. “Do you have any idea how many times I’ve been here, Adam? How many times have I seen the Citadel rebuilt and contributed to it? I assure you, if you’d been at the Zero Day Vault more than a thousand times like I have, you wouldn’t treat this place like it’s special.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly.</p><br><p>“Yeah, I guess so. But for me, it’s my first time!”</p><br><p>“Well, that’s your problem, not mine. When you’ve lived in this world as long as I have, you’ll start to see things differently!”</p><br><p>Despite Damien’s excited voice, his words failed to inspire Adam. On the contrary, Adam’s gaze grew darker.</p><br><p>‘Live as long as Damien? Hah, I don’t even know if I’d want to live for hundreds of years, knowing that my family, acquaintances, and many friends are long dead, and if I make new ones, it will all happen again with the next World Wipe.’</p><br><p>This was a common problem that affected not only Adam. All K4-Phantoms and above had to go through this.</p><br><p>The only ones who could have families were the High Nobles. However, they had a very hard time with each World Wipe.</p><br><p>The best the Twelve Branches could hope for was that their Heads, the Elders, would survive to become K4-Phantoms, along with a few of the strongest and most talented K3-Phantoms, who would get the most protected place under Queen Elisa’s barrier.</p><br><p>‘Damn it. Damn the World Wipe, the Last Star, and the First Star! I thought the main problem facing humanity was the monsters, but… we’re all in the same situation!’</p><br><p>Adam and Damien’s conversation ended. He learned everything he could about the Dark Hearts and the Connected Hearts, at least what Damien could tell him.</p><br><p>Now, they had come to the Zero Day Vault so that Adam could obtain the first part of his Path Construct and begin creating the first Constellation.</p><br><p>They had come for the Midnight Crystal.</p><br><br><p>The half-meter-thick mechanical door opened, letting Adam and Damien inside along with a stream of steam.</p><br><p>This was where all the Midnight Crystals that the Citadel had left for the K3-Phantoms, who would soon reach the next level, were located. Only a small number of them had followed the same path as Adam and absorbed a Twilight Crystal at the Dark Shore.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, inside, Adam saw something completely different from what he had expected. Instead of bright pods, altars, or platforms where the Midnight Crystals could have been, they were surrounded only by steel crates.</p><br><p>There were enough crates to create high walls around them, taking up almost all the available space.</p><br><p>This storage room was empty; none of the Gamma Division had encountered anyone there, and there were no guards inside.</p><br><br><p>Damien touched one of the crates, removing it from the shelf.</p><br><p>“Here we go. I think this one will do for you.”</p><br><p>Then, Damien threw the crate to Adam with such ease as if it were a feather, but as soon as he caught it, he felt its weight and struggled to hold it in his hands.</p><br><p>“This…” Adam gasped as he looked at the crate in disbelief. “There’s a Midnight Crystal inside?”</p><br><p>“Yeah, what else could there be? There’s a compressed shard in each of these boxes. Well, some of them will have to be taken out of here soon because their shelf life is coming to an end, but the crystal that was prepared for you is in perfect condition. You became a K4-Phantom much faster than expected.”</p><br><p>Strange emotions flashed across Adam’s face. Damien spoke of the Midnight Crystals as if they were products in a regular store. Perhaps for Damien, the Midnight and Twilight Crystals had long since ceased to have any meaning, but not for Adam.</p><br><p>On his journey, he had encountered only two star crystals, one of each type, and now the third was right in his hands, in a simple, dusty, iron crate.</p><br><p>“Damien, I thought the Midnight Crystals were impossible to transport and store. Then how did so many Midnight Crystals end up here?”</p><br><p>In response, Damien scratched his cheek.</p><br><p>“These Midnight Crystals are hunted by specially selected K4-Phantoms, many of whom came here from the Bastions. They go after the Midnight Crystals with these crates made of a special metal found in the far reaches of the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>“This is very different from how you first encountered the Midnight Crystal and how other Phantoms find them by accident. But the main reason lies in the Midnight Crystals themselves. They and the Twilight Crystals are very different in many ways, but one difference is crucial.”</p><br><p>Then, Damien pointed to the crate in Adam’s hands.</p><br><p>“Come on. Open it, you’ll see for yourself. After all, this Midnight Crystal is yours. No other Phantom can get it.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly as he lifted the crate. His initials, A. V., were stamped on the edge, along with his Phantom ID number, 14113.</p><br><p>“Alright, let’s do this.”</p>
