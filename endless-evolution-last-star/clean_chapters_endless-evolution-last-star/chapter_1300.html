            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1300: Ureyn’s Fall (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Adam often behaved arrogantly and recklessly; that was the kind of person he was. He knew that abilities and techniques were important, often the deciding factor in victory, and in the Dead Lands, victory meant life, and defeat meant death.</p><br><p>Both Phantoms and monsters understood this. If they only had pure energy at their disposal and couldn’t use it for abilities and techniques, then whoever learned how to do so would immediately become the strongest in the world.</p><br><p>It was a simple truth that didn’t require much thought, but Adam was one of those who believed that this position was not without its drawbacks.</p><br><p>“Techniques and abilities, right?” Adam muttered to himself as his fist trembled with accumulated energy and the chains with rings jingled.</p><br><p>“But if everything were so simple, why do monsters have Threat Levels and Phantoms have K-Levels? Why are all creatures divided into the First Circle and Second Circle? Well… It’s all pretty simple, isn’t it?’</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes deepened as an energy pulse, like a lightning bolt, ran through his arm, becoming the final piece of his attack.</p><br><p>‘If you are several times stronger than your opponent, no abilities or techniques will stop you. What chance do I or another K4-Phantom have against a Lord? Obviously, I wouldn’t win even once, even in a million battles.’</p><br><p>His gaze fell on Ureyn, who was controlling many needles at once—this put a lot of pressure on his body, as evidenced by the trickle of blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam and Ureyn were on the same level, as confirmed by the Connected String. But many, including the monsters of the White Thread and Gray Needle, did not understand what was obvious to Adam.</p><br><p>‘Ureyn is like a swordsman who, for some reason, decided to use a spear and actually believes that this weapon is the best choice for him. How naive and foolish. Hmm, he will either understand this or lose with shame that will completely break him.’</p><br><p>Not only with monsters and Phantoms, but with ordinary people, the following situation often occurred:</p><br><p>A person might try something, fail, and instead of trying again and correcting their mistakes, they move on to something completely different, where they suffer defeat again in their new endeavor.</p><br><p>It was a vicious circle from which there was no escape, and Ureyn, having exchanged his wind for a needle and the techniques of his faction, became part of this circle without even suspecting it.</p><br><p>Adam was not obligated to help Ureyn with this problem, and he had no intention of doing so. All he needed now was to win.</p><br><p>‘If he wants to give me a decent fight, I’ll take it, but if he can’t even beat himself, then… I’ll just move on.’</p><br><p>Before Adam’s fist hit the ground, Ureyn saw it—he saw the disappointment in Adam’s eyes and even a hint of contempt for his weakness.</p><br><p>It caused a real outrage in Ureyn’s soul, but that wasn’t what he should have been worrying about at that moment.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With a deafening blast, the crimson blades scattered to the sides, followed by a destructive shockwave.</p><br><p>The hundred needles turned into nothing, and no matter how hard Ureyn tried to stop the crimson blade with the other needles, it was all in vain.</p><br><p>‘Shit! I have to get out of here!’ Ureyn exclaimed inwardly as he realized that his dome would not be able to withstand Adam’s attack.</p><br><p>Running away at full speed, Ureyn turned around to see the crimson blades simply blow away a million tiny needles, which fell to the ground like fragments of a broken mirror.</p><br><p>It seemed that in the broken needles he could see his reflection—his frightened gaze.</p><br><p>If one of the strongest techniques couldn’t stop him, then how could I defeat him?</p><br><p>This thought flashed through Ureyn’s mind again and again as he looked toward Draug and the other members of the Gray Needle.</p><br><p>Unlike last time, he couldn’t get any advice from them. Not because they didn’t want to help him, but because they couldn’t.</p><br><p>‘They don’t know…’ Ureyn thought with a desperate look. ‘If they were in my place, they wouldn’t be able to oppose Adam, but… why?’</p><br><br><p>A loud crack echoed in Ureyn’s mind, letting bright light into the dark chamber where he had placed himself for the past few years.</p><br><p>But that was clearly not enough.</p><br><br><p>Adam strode forward, among the broken needles that covered the ground like millions of snowflakes. Even the gusts of wind that were frequent visitors here could not move them quickly.</p><br><p>“Now do you see it?” Adam asked arrogantly, raising his chin. “Why do you need complex technology if it can be destroyed with one powerful blow?”</p><br><p>Then, he raised his arm, pointing at the Nexus.</p><br><p>“If you think that was my strongest and most complex ability, I’m sorry to disappoint you.” Adam pointed to the first ring. “That was the simplest ability of my Nexus. Do you think your techniques will help you if I use the second or fourth ring?”</p><br><p>The answer was obvious.</p><br><p>And it seemed that Ureyn was finally beginning to understand. However, Adam wasn’t going to give him time to wait patiently on the sidelines.</p><br><br><p>Adam appeared in front of Ureyn as his fist slammed straight into Ureyn’s face, who clearly wasn’t expecting it.</p><br><p>“Come on, don’t just stand there staring ahead like an idiot. We’re in the middle of a fight, and the stakes are high. I’m not going to lose just because you’re a weakling!”</p><br><br><p>Adam’s punches continued without stopping. Ureyn didn’t have time to understand how Adam’s fist plunged into his stomach, solar plexus, jaw, and then the whole cycle repeated itself.</p><br><p>Finally, Adam turned and, with one last blow straight to Ureyn’s chest, threw him far back, leaving bleeding cuts on his chest.</p><br><p>“Come on, Ureyn!” Draug exclaimed, intervening in the fight for the first time. “You and your needles are capable of more! Use other techniques!”</p><br><p>However, in response, he heard only a hoarse growl devoid of any respect for the old man.</p><br><p>“Shut up… You piece of shit who brought me to this miserable state!” Ureyn’s voice thundered across the battlefield.</p><br><p>Then, he rose from the ground and squeezed his needle so tightly that it cracked, shattering into pieces like useless trash.</p><br><p>Along with this, powerful gusts of wind came from afar, moving straight towards Ureyn like old allies ready to forgive him for abandoning them.</p><br>
