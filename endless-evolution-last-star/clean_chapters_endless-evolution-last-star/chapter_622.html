            <br><p>What could Erik ask of, considering how favorable the terms were for Fromund?</p><br><p>Sure, he didn't like the idea that if a deal was made he would be dependent on someone since Erik would have patronage over Elva, Liv, and Tilda, and thus to some extent he would have control over his younger sisters.</p><br><p>But, if he wanted to move forward, someone or something would have to be a backup plan for his younger sisters in the event of his demise. One of the Twelve Branches was one of the best options. Moreover, Fromund didn't feel any threat from Erik and so far he was willing to work with this man.</p><br><p>"I already have experience in this...? What are you talking about?" Fromund asked.</p><br><p>The confusion was evident on his face, all he had done since leaving the Lower Ring was fight monsters and make money - all the same things most Phantoms did.</p><br><p>In response, Erik grinned, shrugging encouragingly.</p><br><p>"Hey, it only happened a few days ago and you already forgot?"</p><br><br><p>Then, when Fromund had his first guesses, Erik reached forward his hand with an open palm.</p><br><p>"The Rule of Power."</p><br><p>Fromund's eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>"If you agree to my terms, you will be obligated to fight in another The Rule of Power whenever I, or my family, need it."</p><br><br><p>Feeling the anxiety spreading through his body, Fromund asked:</p><br><br><br><p>"What...?" Fromund tilted his head, he didn't understand what Erik was talking about or what he wanted from him.</p><br><p>Erik leaned forward, their gazes meeting each other.</p><br><p>"I don't want you to fight in battle, I want to have your agreement to do it when I need it, and... it could be as soon as a month from now, a year from now, or never."</p><br><br><p>Silence fell for a brief period.</p><br><p>Stay updated via My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Fromund pondered what he just heard, and Erik gave him time for it.</p><br><p>'I see...' Fromund thought, 'If he has confidence in my powers and abilities, then such a condition is a very likely victory in this The Rule of Power. Given his status and influence... it might be a better deal for him than for me.'</p><br><p>He realized that The Rule of Power was a unique and dangerous tool. It allowed conflicts between very high-level fighters to be resolved by lower-level ones.</p><br><p>Thus, the winner was not the one who had the highest pure power, it was already equal otherwise there would be no The Rule of Power, but the one who had the exceptional talent in his arsenal.</p><br><p>"That's my only condition."</p><br><p>Erik leaned back in his chair, put one leg over the other, and placed his hands on his knee.</p><br><p>"You don't have to give your answer right away. As soon as I get the message that you've received 450,000,000 credits, it will be tantamount to a contract between us."</p><br><p>Then, Erik pointed to the crimson coin, all Fromund had to do was to attach the device to his NEP and a huge amount of money would be in his account and the contract signed.</p><br><p>"You can destroy it or just throw it away, I will accept your refusal. You can consult your sisters or make the decision for them. No matter what you choose, it's up to you since you're the only one here."</p><br><p>Not intending to linger any longer, Erik stood up, adjusted his coat, and swung his cane towards the exit.</p><br><p>Fromund didn't stop him or bid him farewell, he just stared at the crimson coin, at the flashing blue screen and the yellow numbers.</p><br><p>Seconds turned into minutes, and minutes merged into hours. Soon, Fromund's eyelids grew heavier, his eyes wanting to close and plunge him into sleep.</p><br><p>But... Fromund resisted. He couldn't make up his mind, pondering many things and his prospects.</p><br><p>He realized that if he stayed at his level, it would take him several decades to pay off his debt.</p><br><p>And... no one gave guarantees that during that time there wouldn't be an accident resulting in his death.</p><br><br><p>Fromund wheezed, taking the crimson coin in his hand.</p><br><p>"Once, a man offered me an opportunity and I didn't turn it down. It gave me everything I have now."</p><br><br><p>"What's the point of refusing? Stop thinking, I need to act!"</p><br><p>At the same moment, he directed the crimson coin towards his NEP, putting the backside against the screen.</p><br><p>A few seconds were enough for 450,000,000,000 million to turn into 0, into nothing, ending up in Fromund's account.</p><br><br><p>The message flashed on the phone, drawing two ruby eyes to it.</p><br><p>A slight smirk appeared on Erik's face as he set the phone aside and picked up a glass filled with whiskey.</p><br><p>"That was faster than I expected, but it just shows I made the right choice."</p><br><p>Watching the rippling ice in his glass, Erik narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>"I wonder... Which one of you is going to destroy your First Wall the first? Either way, it looks like Adam Vinter will have one more thing to do before finally returning to the Dead Lands."</p><br><br><p>Taking a short sip, Erik sighed looking up at the slowly swaying chandelier.</p><br><p>"But, is his bond with his Operator strong enough? This could be the end for them, as it is for so many pairs who think they trust each other completely."</p><br><br><p>"The Operator and the Phantom. Neither of them, until a certain point, even realize that this isn't just their job. It's fate. And, while one had no choice, the other deliberately chose its path. This seemingly insignificant difference often becomes the destroyer of two worlds."</p><br><br><p>At the same time, in the middle of the deep night, one man opened his eyes, awakening from a rich, peaceful sleep.</p><br><br><p>The man's eyes ran from side to side, trying to figure out how he ended up here - in a dark room, in chains and deprived of his powers.</p><br><p>This had never happened before, the man had never found himself in such a hopeless and even desperate situation. And, worst of all was the unknown engulfing him.</p><br><p>Soon fear filled Zarot's eyes when the only door leading into the room opened, letting in a sinister silhouette that looked like a demon arrived from hell.</p>
