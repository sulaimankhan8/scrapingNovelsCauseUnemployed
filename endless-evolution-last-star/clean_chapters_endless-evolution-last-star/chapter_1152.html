            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1152: First Constellation</strong></p><br><p>Did Adam know that sooner or later, he would face the trials of the K4-Level?</p><br><p>Sure, he understood that most, if not every K4-Phantom, had gone through this. Reaching the Second Rank was an almost impossible task, but starting the journey was much easier.</p><br><p>Adam hoped that he would soon be able to unravel the mystery of the black orb, as he realized that it was an alternative to the Two Walls and the Crystal Gates. Without this piece, he would not be able to continue on his path and become as strong as the Second Rank Phantoms and Lords.</p><br><p>“The Path Construct?” Adam gulped, looking at the countless stars connecting into separate constellations.</p><br><p>However, most of the stars remained in darkness, under a dim veil, almost hidden by the darkness.</p><br><p>The only thing that was truly bright was the first constellation and its initial star.</p><br><p>In fact, Adam had several choices. He could direct his gaze to any of the three stars at the beginning of the first constellation.</p><br><p>Adam had to make a choice.</p><br><p>There was no Evolution Tree, no Lone Blaze, not even Silvana.</p><br><p>In the end, he was the core of everything, he was the beginning and the end of this small world in which all his power was stored.</p><br><p>“Alright…” Adam muttered, looking around.</p><br><p>He made sure that there was nothing but the constellation in front of him. A boundless darkness, unlike anything he was used to, surrounded him.</p><br><p>“I don’t know what situation the other Phantoms are in, whether they all have three choices, but… This is what I have to do, isn’t it?”</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward as the three stars connected by a line trembled to cast their light upon him.</p><br><p>[Star #1: Absorb 3 Midnight Crystals.]</p><br><p>[Star #2: Absorb 3 Twilight Crystals.]</p><br><p>[Star #3: Absorb 1 Midnight Crystal, 1 Twilight Crystal, as well as 1 Dark Heart or 1 Connected Heart.]</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened.</p><br><p>He didn’t know what to expect from the stars. He only knew that his trials would be revealed before him, and he was not mistaken.</p><br><p>“Damn… the first and second stars, their conditions are clear, but…” His gaze fell on the third star at the base of the constellation, at the very beginning, while the other two were higher up. “If you have a place like this and conditions like these, then you must be the special one, right?”</p><br><p>It was a correct assumption, but that wasn’t what worried Adam in the first place.</p><br><p>No matter what the situation was, he simply couldn’t help but choose the most challenging option. Perhaps it was because deep down he hoped that in that case he would receive a commensurate reward, even though this was real life and not a game, and things didn’t always work that way.</p><br><p>But, in reality, Adam couldn’t cope with his desire to go through the most difficult trial.</p><br><p>Maybe in the end, he wouldn’t get the most valuable reward even though he would put in much more effort, but it would be the most difficult path.</p><br><p>[To start creating a constellation, you must choose one of the starting points!]</p><br><p>[You will not be able to change your choice!]</p><br><p>[Each choice will affect the construction of future constellations and stars!]</p><br><p>An unfamiliar mechanical voice echoed in Adam’s mind over and over, but he paid no attention to it.</p><br><p>He had already made his decision.</p><br><p>“Dark Heart or Connected Heart? What the hell is that?”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes lit up as he reached for the third star.</p><br><p>[Star #3 has been selected!]</p><br><p>[Without fulfilling the conditions of the stars, it will be impossible to develop other stars and constellations!]</p><br><p>[The Path Construct will indicate the location of targets through energy flows, but it will not be able to indicate threats!]</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With the active trembling of the Path Construct, two of the three stars turned into nothing, as did the connecting lines.</p><br><p>The remaining star hovered in place. Either Adam would be able to fulfill the conditions and move on, or he would remain at this stage forever.</p><br><p>Sure, it seemed like there was nothing complicated about it. All he needed was time to find the Midnight and Twilight Crystals, as well as to find out what those hearts were and where to look for them.</p><br><p>However, he couldn’t forget that this was the first star, and Adam still had a lot of work ahead of him.</p><br><p>“So… That’s it? Now I just go on a quest?”</p><br><p>There was no answer, only the star trembled and crashed into his chest with a bright flash.</p><br><p>The next moment, when Adam opened his eyes, he found himself in the real world. The inner space was once again fully accessible to him, and Silvana’s voice finally reached his mind.</p><br><p>“Adam! What happened to you?!”</p><br><p>With a bitter smile, Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>“This… is the beginning of my next journey. It seems it’s time to return to the very beginning, Silvana. I’ll need missions, lots of missions, so I can find what I need.”</p><br><p>A few minutes later, Adam explained everything to Silvana.</p><br><p>She had not known about the Path Construct before, but she quickly understood the situation. One way or another, she had expected something like this.</p><br><p>“I see, so you need the Midnight and Twilight Crystals again?”</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly, looking at the horizon, the dark lands, and the toxic lakes.</p><br><p>“Yes, but that won’t be the main problem, I can feel it. The hearts… I have no idea what they are or where to find them. Are they a resource? Maybe they’re the hearts of monsters? If so, what kind of monsters do I have to kill?”</p><br><p>“Don’t worry about it.” Silvana sighed, already searching for information about the Path Construct. “I mean, we’ll figure it out like we always do.”</p><br><p>Silvana, like Adam, had been waiting for this moment. She hoped it would strengthen their bond even more and open up new possibilities for both of them.</p><br><p>What Adam and Silvana didn’t know was that after the Path Construct, everything had changed.</p><br><p>The storm of darkness that appeared out of nowhere was moving straight toward Adam, hidden behind the horizon, but its speed was tremendous.</p>
