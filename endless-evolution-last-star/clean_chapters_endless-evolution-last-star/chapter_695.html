            <br><br><p>Adam fell to the ground, his legs and arms wide open and a wide grin on his face.</p><br><p>He watched the fountain of blood spurt from the Mighty Commander's body for a long moment before weakening, turning into a faint stream.</p><br><p>"Agh... What a great fight..."</p><br><p>Soon, he heard Silvana's voice:</p><br><p>'Looks like you enjoyed it to the fullest.'</p><br><p>Adam smiled weakly, gazing at the vibrant crystals above. Some of them were shattered like stalactites, but there was still enough to cover the spacious cavern with light.</p><br><p>"Well... I can't deny that. But, I must move on."</p><br><p>Though it was another victory over the fortress monster, it was Adam's most difficult fight since he returned to the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>Thick blood covered most of his body, Adam's situation was much better than the Mighty Commander's, but he was far from the peak of his strength.</p><br><p>'Maybe you should get some rest? I mean, your final opponent isn't clear yet. We'll probably be able to find out when you get to the External Artifact, at least that's where your First Wall is pointing.'</p><br><p>In response, Adam only shook his head, approaching the Mighty Commander with a calm stride.</p><br><p>"I'm injured and have lost a lot of energy, it's true, but from the looks of it, I'll be recovered as a victory bonus."</p><br><p>With a careless wave of his hand, Adam stood in front of the Mighty Commander and leaned into the cut-covered paws of his opponent.</p><br><p>Silvana wanted to say something, but Adam interrupted her:</p><br><p>"Yeah, I realize that besides that the moral and psychological component is also important, but..."</p><br><br><p>Adam removed two heavy bracelets from the massive paws as a wide smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"This fight wasn't an exhausting one for me, on the contrary, I feel like I'm making a comeback. The Dead Lands is where I belong, not in an arena fighting for the amusement of the nobles."</p><br><br><p>Not without effort, Adam lifted the stone bracelets, feeling their weight and the energy hidden deep within.</p><br><p>"And... The Wild Lands has made everything so much better. It's not a battlefield where you can fight monsters knowing the Citadel is nearby, it's a dangerous world full of monsters and I fucking love it!"</p><br><p>Repeating the Mighty Commander's movements, Adam slammed the bracelets against each other.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The bracelets shuddered, releasing amber energy. As with the crimson spear, the stone bracelets began to transform, releasing two waves of energy outward, purple and amber.</p><br><p>Adam's assumption proved to be correct, so soon his wounds began to heal quickly and the energy began to regenerate, filling every part of his body.</p><br><p>In some ways, at that moment Adam was even stronger than when he entered the fortress. He was in full battle mode, but his morale was on another level, more importantly, he remembered what it was like to fight against monsters.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The bracelets trembled again as they shattered into debris. The amber energy emanating from the edges began to mix the fragments, changing their shape and size to become a single, unified object.</p><br><p>The majestic amber hammer soared in front of Adam, soon finding itself in his hands.</p><br><p>For a moment his eyes went wide as he practically dropped the hammer, the weight was too much.</p><br><p>"Damn... I didn't expect it to be so heavy. Agh, I wasn't going to fight with the hammer anyway, though it might have come up to Fromund, right?"</p><br><p>Dragging the hammer across the ground, Adam headed towards the right statue, the one with the helmet wearing full plate armor like a warrior.</p><br><p>"Hah, when you think about it like that..."</p><br><p>His eyes darted towards the left statue, eyeing the crimson spear.</p><br><p>"He'd be fine with two statue weapons, considering his special Nexus."</p><br><br><p>Knowing what to do, Adam tossed the amber hammer high up into the statue's hands.</p><br><p>The hammer, covered in thick energy, was in the statue's firm grip, its fingers shifting to grip the weapon's hilt, feeling the active energy moving all the way from top to bottom.</p><br><p>An amber stream of energy traveled down the stone path, quickly reaching the round platform and transforming into complex runes, covering 2/3 of it in total.</p><br><p>In the end, there was only one statue left, but... Adam faced a problem.</p><br><p>"Wait... The flame thread led me to the first statue, I found the purple sphere on my own, the Mighty Commander was already here, so... how do I find the third weapon for the last statue?"</p><br><br><p>'Hmm... Maybe you should explore the statues? I mean, there should be some clues here, at least I hope so.'</p><br><p>Adam had no other options, so scratching the back of his head he headed towards the round platform, wanting to check the statue with the spear first.</p><br><p>Find more adventures on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, the platform shuddered as a stream of flame appeared from the very center, just like the middle level of the fortress in the main courtyard.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, not because he wasn't expecting it, but because the color of the flames was different.</p><br><p>"How strange... In the courtyard, all the streams were purple, but this one is blue..." Adam gulped, tentatively approaching the bright fire.</p><br><p>Like all the previous times, a rune hovered above the flames, but it was a unique rune that Adam had never seen before, not even when choosing a reward from the purple sphere.</p><br><p>The rune resembled an arrow, changing direction from time to time.</p><br><p>"Well, I guess I have no other choice anyway, right?"</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, Adam reached forward absorbing the rune and all the energy from the stream.</p><br><br><p>A refreshing gust of energy swept through his body, causing his eyes to glow brightly for a moment. The purple flow from the stone bracelets healed his wounds and refilled his energy reserves, but not completely, just a larger portion.</p><br><p>The blue energy stream corrected that deficiency, that was his reward for defeating two serious opponents.</p><br><p>Previously the runes remained in Adam's hand, but the blue arrow simply darted forward in the opposite direction from the statues.</p><br><p>Adam stared after the arrow for a while before smiling bitterly, shaking his head.</p><br><p>"Fuck, so I have to go back? Hah, looks like there's a secret passage leading here that I missed."</p>
