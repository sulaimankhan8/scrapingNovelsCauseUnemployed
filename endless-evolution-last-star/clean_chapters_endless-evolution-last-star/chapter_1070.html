            <h4>Chapter 1070: Three Earls</h4><br><p>The flight was not available to everyone. It wasn’t greatly affected by strength, rather, it was abilities, equipment, or the construction of the body that mattered.
</p><br><p>Birds didn’t need engines like fighter planes to take off, they only needed their low weight, the structures of their wings creating air pockets, and a bit of experience.
</p><br><p>The same was true for monsters. The White Threat Monster could easily be able to fly, it wasn’t unusual, and it didn’t necessarily give any advantage in battle. It depended on the specific situation.
</p><br><p>But, flying was useful in covering a long distance in as short a time as possible. Moving through the air was much easier and faster than on the ground because there were no obstacles up there.
</p><br><p>For most Lords, this wasn’t a problem. Even if they couldn’t fly or have the necessary body parts like wings, they could use their energy to do so.
</p><br><p>It was one thing to step through the air like Saegar did, creating platforms beneath him, and quite another to fly forward at high speed.
</p><br><p>Well, energy was a flexible tool, especially when it was used by three Earls wielding energy control to perfection.
</p><br><p>Each had different abilities to use energy to fly, but there were only a few basic ones.
</p><br><br><p>A girl with short chin-length gray hair moved in the center of the powerful trio, splitting the skies of the different regions they were passing through with great speed.
</p><br><p>Her energy was kept in a smooth, strict cone shape around her, splitting the air currents in front of her to achieve the least resistance. Simultaneously, two powerful streams like flames from jet engines were coming out of her legs, pushing her forward until she reached her goal.
</p><br><p>On the left was a calm man with long blond hair and eyes as cold as ice. His energy flow was not so active, he was calm, and everything from his expression to his energy control showed only perfect execution.
</p><br><p>On the right was his opposite. A large man with a menacing look and a great jaw that could not contain his even larger fangs. His energy trembled, pulsing in waves, constantly changing his speed, just as active as his large heart beating.
</p><br><p>"We’re actually going to do this, right?" the man with the long hair asked, looking forward.
</p><br><p>"Yes." The girl nodded deeply. "Kenex, I understand your concern, but even if our opponent is a True Lord such as Saegar, there are three of us. Against us, he doesn’t stand much of a chance."
</p><br><p>"Hahaha, Serra! That’s what a leader should sound like!" The man on the right laughed.
</p><br><p>Serra frowned. "Horon! Be serious for fuck’s sake! This battle could change a lot of things!"
</p><br><p>Then, Horon’s expression became serious as he narrowed his eyes as if he could see what was dozens of kilometers ahead.
</p><br><p>"Come on, Serra, it’s not just about Saegar, right? The Befallen Crown wants to get rid of two unwanted Lords and... more importantly, kill that young Phantom. Not many monsters of the New Wave have a chance of becoming Lords in the time they have.
</p><br><p>There are even fewer such talents among humans. After all, there are far fewer Second Rank Phantoms than Lords. And... the ones the First Star has its eye on? Damn, I doubt they would have sent three Earls against Saegar if that guy wasn’t there."
</p><br><p>Kenex nodded deeply in affirmation.
</p><br><p>"I agree. The Befallen Crown doesn’t just want victory and a change of leader at the Soaring Chain Islands, they want it to happen quickly."
</p><br><p>After a few moments, Serra bit her lip.
</p><br><p>"What about the Sacrificial Waterfalls? The Lord in charge of that territory slumbers somewhere deep beneath the bloody lakes. Right now... No one has a way to get to their Lord, but that won’t be necessary."
</p><br><p>"Well, there are quite a few capable elders among them." Horon shrugged. "If we need support at a lower level, a lot of regenerative monsters will open up opportunities for us."
</p><br><p>"Alright, let’s speed things up. After all, we need to get this job done quickly."
</p><br><p>Kenex and Horon nodded. One way or another, Serra was their leader. It was their direct responsibility to obey her orders. Though, like all monsters, they did so not because of her status or roles on their team, and for one simple factor-
</p><br><br><p>It didn’t matter what the monster looked like or how high her status was. Strength was still the deciding factor in many situations.
</p><br><br><p>"Well, well... Looks like they’re getting close." Saegar’s eyes sparkled as he stood among the islands right in the air.
</p><br><br><p>Kenward approached him. He, like Saegar, used the same trick, gathering energy under his boots.
</p><br><p>"Three Earls... Unlike the creatures that are in the First Circle, quantity matters. They can be a problem for you and... Could make you use it..."
</p><br><p>Then, Kenward looked down.
</p><br><p>"These are beautiful lands. I wouldn’t want them destroyed in the heat of battle."
</p><br><p>"Hahaha! Are you saying that because you’ve decided to help me out, or just don’t want to lose the opportunity to get free desserts from my dear maids? By the way, some of them like you, if you want, I can help you get acquainted."
</p><br><p>Kenward only shook his head at his joke.
</p><br><p>"Let’s put it this way... I’ll make a decision depending on the situation. If it doesn’t involve the First Star, then it’s entirely up to my will."
</p><br><p>After a few moments, a sly smirk appeared on Saegar’s face. Slowly, his gaze traveled lower to the gorge.
</p><br><p>"You know, this is already connected to the First Star. They’re not coming here to kill me. They’re coming here to kill me and thus pave their way to Adam before he gets to the Twilight Crystal. That’s their main goal."
</p><br><p>Kenward glanced at Saegar.
</p><br><p>"I’m surprised you would say that. Doesn’t it crumble your ego that the Befallen Crown sees more of a threat in the K3-Phantom than in you?"
</p><br><br><p>He burst into laughter.
</p><br><p>"I told you you know me well.
</p><br><br><p>"My ego will be restored when the Befallen Crown has three less obedient Lords. I will know that they know I am the cause of it."
</p><br><br><p>"That will be enough for me."</p>
