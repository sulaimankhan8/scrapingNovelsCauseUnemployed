            <br><p>Suddenly, the work of the hospital came to a halt. All the employees froze as they heard the alarm of a fire breaking out.</p><br><p>This was extremely rare, this was a hospital by the fort, so accidental fires were ruled out. There were many degrees of protection in all dangerous technical places, and there were ways to quickly extinguish the blaze before it spread.</p><br><p>However, this was not true for the wards, there were only sensors that were triggered when patients decided to smoke even though it was forbidden.</p><br><p>Now, the situation was different, because the alarm was real and the flames were quickly gaining power.</p><br><p>Employees and patients outside could see a stream of flames coming from one window on the eighth floor.</p><br><p>There was nothing they could do but try to put out the fire, the medical team, along with paramedics, ran to room 22, with several fire extinguishers.</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam watched as the flames intensified and Silvana's panic grew. The fire couldn't burn his coat or harm him, but it was quickly burning everything around him.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes narrowed as Silvana's clothes began to burn, his ear twitched, he heard a hurried stomp to his left - medics running towards them at full speed.</p><br><p>Adam didn't panic, but like Silvana, he didn't understand what was happening.</p><br><p>That didn't stop him from taking action, though.</p><br><br><p>Adam shifted forward, dashing through the flames to hug Silvana tightly.</p><br><p>"No! Adam! Get away!"</p><br><p>Silvana exclaimed, trying to push Adam from her. She didn't succeed, he didn't even flinch, to her it was like trying to move a mountain.</p><br><p>"I'm not kidding! I don't know what's going on! You have to leave! I don't want to hurt you!"</p><br><br><p>In the next moment, Adam hugged Silvana tightly again, his hands now touching her soft skin, for there was almost nothing left of her clothes. The light, breathable fabric was an easy target for the raging fire.</p><br><p>Silvana gasped, his fingers were cold, but his embrace warm. She wanted support, but she feared hurting him multiple that.</p><br><br><p>His firm voice penetrated her mind, while his hug stopped tighter, as if wanting to shield Silvana from her blaze.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide, feeling something inside her change. Having a brief moment of peace, she realized that something strange was happening to her Evolution Sprout, its energy surging wildly.</p><br><p>However, as soon as she saw the lines of fire picked up at the door, panic swooped in with renewed vigor.</p><br><p>"Your fire can't hurt me, the staff will take care of the rest."</p><br><p>Then, Adam leaned back, staring intently at her.</p><br><p>"Still, you need to take things steady. That's the best we can do. We need to put out the flames, together."</p><br><p>Silently, Silvana nodded slowly as if mesmerized. Deep inside, she envied his calmness, wishing she possessed the same fortitude.</p><br><p>The flame continued to develop, but not as vigorously, struggling to escape through the closed door, but eventually, it would succeed.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the footsteps grew louder, the medics were already very close. Adam's eyes grew deeper as he used the gene field, invisible to everyone, even Silvana.</p><br><p>Now, he could clearly see five silhouettes standing outside the door, in the next few seconds they would rush in to put out the flames.</p><br><p>Adam looked down, there wasn't a shred of Silvana's clothes left. She was completely naked, though she didn't realize it herself. Her eyes were closed since she was trying to get the flames under control.</p><br><p>With a serious expression, Adam nodded deeply. He stopped hugging Silvana and quickly stood up.</p><br><br><p>Silvana opened her eyes, but before she could realize anything, a shadow fell over her. Then, Adam's torn, wide coat covered her.</p><br><br><p>With a loud crack, the door opened, and several men ran inside. The first thing they saw was Adam who was covering a stumped Silvana.</p><br><p>His eyes lowered to the massive fire extinguishers. With a deep nod, he gave his approval.</p><br><p>The medics exchanged a glance, the flames continued to grow so they had no other choice.</p><br><p>Then, under pressure, gray streams rushed from the extinguishers, covering Silvana and Adam.</p><br><p>For the first few seconds it helped, Silvana's flames grew weaker, but... though she calmed down, her Evolution Sprout saw it as an attack on itself.</p><br><p>Silvana gasped as the heat within her grew stronger, the fire burst out in torrents with renewed vigor.</p><br><p>'This is bad... Very bad...' Adam muttered internally, covering Silvana with himself.</p><br><p>He had no idea how to stop her flames, the medics seemed lost as well.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, a silhouette appeared in the window, leaping straight up to the eighth floor from the street.</p><br><p>Adam turned around to see a pair of cold eyes staring intently at him and the confused medics.</p><br><p>Long white hair fell in waves over the silhouette's shoulders, the sharp tips hanging in the air like radar.</p><br><p>Then, the girl waved her hand, directing in Adam's direction a stream of frost, slightly saturated with dense energy.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam stood before Silvana, afraid that the energy would freeze Silvana. After all, she was a mere human, but... was she anymore?</p><br><p>A thin layer of ice formed on Adam's back, streams of cold rushing over his shoulders, falling on Silvana, effortlessly suppressing her flames.</p><br><p>Forcibly, but her Evolution Spout's burst was quelled, its strength running out, the sprout was incapable of resisting such a strong but moderate frost.</p><br><p>The medics were shivering, but not from fear, their teeth were chattering from the cold as they instinctively clutched their shoulders tightly trying to keep warm.</p><br><br><p>The girl jumped off the window, shards of glass breaking beneath her stride.</p><br><p>She glanced at the group of medics, stern and commanding.</p><br><p>"Report everything to the head. There's no further danger, but this is a rare case. You must deal with the aftermath as quickly as possible."</p><br><br><p>The medics simultaneously replied before running out of the room, afraid of freezing to death.</p><br><p>The only one who wasn't cold was Silvana since Adam took most of the impact.</p><br><p>He slowly got off the bed, meeting the white-haired girl's gaze. One look was enough for him to realize that she was much stronger than he was.</p><br><p>Adam wondered: What awaited them? Would there be a punishment for Silvana?</p><br><br><p>Was it, on the contrary, a reward they were not prepared for?</p>
