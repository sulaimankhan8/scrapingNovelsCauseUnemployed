            <h4>Chapter 1127: Spare Me!</h4><br><p>Adam noticed the mysterious monster right from the start, but he didn’t rush to show that he knew everything about it. He acted slowly to some extent, as he first figured out how his new ability worked, gathered his peak strength, and only then moved on to the attack.
</p><br><p>As expected, unlike all the other monsters, that one did not die from Adam’s single attack. No, two green daggers opposed Adam’s red rods, preventing him from finishing everything too quickly.
</p><br><p>Ahead, Adam saw a girl with long blond hair and deep green eyes. If it weren’t for Adam and the heat of battle, her beauty would surely have stunned him.
</p><br><p>But this was Adam, and he had no intention of stopping.
</p><br><p>Due to the steam emanating from his own body, the girl’s face was distorted and unclear. However, he could see her aura more clearly than ever. Even if Adam closed his eyes now, he could easily determine her exact location.
</p><br><p>"Wait! Let’s talk!" The girl exclaimed, trying to jump back.
</p><br><p>However, Adam didn’t listen to her. He rushed forward, breaking through several walls behind which the girl tried to hide.
</p><br><br><p>Every time the girl tried to escape, Adam easily caught up with her, leaving destruction in his wake.
</p><br><p>Still, unlike the frightened girl, who felt as if a living nightmare was chasing her, Lone Blaze had doubts on his face.
</p><br><p>"This... He’s using too much power. He won’t be able to keep fighting at this pace for too long."
</p><br><p>In response, Silvana waved her hand.
</p><br><p>"Don’t worry. I’m sure he can last a few more minutes. Moreover, this girl will last much less."
</p><br><p>"Do you think she should be killed?" Lone Blaze muttered.
</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply.
</p><br><p>"Sure, that’s out of the question. However..." she bit her lip. "If she has useful information, it would be better to use her than kill her. Let’s see how it goes. Adam has to make a decision, although it doesn’t look like he’s thinking about it yet."
</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.
</p><br><p>One strike after another rained down on the girl as she desperately tried to block Adam’s relentless attacks.
</p><br><p>"Fuck! Stop it! Give me a chance!" the girl exclaimed as green energy ran through her body like a flame.
</p><br><p>Roots burst out of the ground, wrapping around Adam’s wrists and ankles.
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, it worked.
</p><br><p>There was enough force to stop Adam in his tracks, but his trembling muscles and seething aura showed that he could break free at any moment. The only question was how much energy he would have to expend to do so.
</p><br><p>"Argh. Alright, what do you want? You were watching me from that tower. If you wanted to, you could have run away much earlier, but you didn’t."
</p><br><br><br><p>"My name is Dayra, what about you?"
</p><br><p>Adam rolled his eyes.
</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter. If you’re hoping your name will help you survive, I wouldn’t bet on it."
</p><br><p>"This... You didn’t come here for me, right?"
</p><br><p>In response, Adam narrowed his eyes. It was true. Dayra couldn’t be a Flash Carrier; she was too weak for that. Moreover, Adam, as a Phantom who had absorbed a Twilight Crystal, could easily sense the energy of the First Star within her, but Dayra was pure, with not a trace of darkness lingering around her.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, I came here to deal with the Flash Carrier. You know what that is, right?"
</p><br><p>In response, Dayra only nodded slightly. Deep down, she hoped that Adam would ask about it because it opened up opportunities for negotiation.
</p><br><br><p>"And..." Adam lingered. "You know where it is, since you’re one of the Elders of the Corrosive Lakes, right?"
</p><br><p>"Everything is as you say. I am the Lesser Elder of the F2 Black Threat Monster, as you call us."
</p><br><p>Adam thought for a moment:
</p><br><p>’I see. So the F1 Black Threat Monsters are too weak for this. Moreover, she is an Awakened One. She is much stronger than the other F2 Black Threat Monsters, which is why she is a Lesser Elder.’
</p><br><p>"So... You want to trade your leader for your life?"
</p><br><p>For the first time, something other than excitement and fear appeared on Dayra’s face—contempt.
</p><br><p>"Pfffft! That bastard just got lucky that the First Star noticed him. He was only slightly stronger than us, but he acted as if he had already become a Lord! Tsk, I can’t even imagine how his ego will grow when he absorbs all the energy of the black flash!"
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes deepened for a moment. From Dayra’s reaction, he began to understand much better how the monsters felt about the dark dream.
</p><br><p>"Hey, Dayra, I have a question for you."
</p><br><p>"Hmm?" she raised an eyebrow.
</p><br><p>"Your life depends on this answer. We both understand that I can kill you if I want to, even though I’ll have to sacrifice something, but I’m ready for that."
</p><br><p>Dayra gulped but nodded. She didn’t try to run away even though her roots had grabbed Adam because she understood that he was right. If she wanted to survive, she had to negotiate with him instead of running away.
</p><br><p>"Which of the four are you?"
</p><br><p>"What are you talking about? Clarify your question."
</p><br><br><p>"The Befallen Crown, the Free End, the Renegades, or are you a neutral one?"
</p><br><p>"Oh, it’s not often you meet a K4-Phantom with such deep knowledge of our factions."
</p><br><p>"So? What’s your answer?" Adam’s voice grew lower.
</p><br><p>After a moment, Dayra placed her palms on her chest and raised her gaze.
</p><br><p>"Like all monsters in the Tarnished Lands, I belong to the Renegades, but if I were at the Dark Shore, closer to the First Star, I would definitely try to become one of the Free End in the future!"
</p><br><br><br><br><p>"Sure. You don’t know this, but the Free End won’t officially recognize you if you’re not strong enough. As a Lesser Lord, I don’t have the right to call myself a true follower of the Free End."
</p><br><p>"Good." Adam nodded his head just as Wilfred had done before Lexa.
</p><br><p>Then, an unusual energy began to emanate from his body, dark, dense, and ancient, causing Dayra’s face to pale and her knees to tremble.</p>
