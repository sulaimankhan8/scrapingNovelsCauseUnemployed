            <br><p>Wilfred stared at Adam for a long time, getting an equally threatening look in return. </p><br><p>Wilfred was hardly an enemy to Adam, but if he wasn't an enemy, that didn't mean he was a friend. Adam was experienced enough to realize that simple truth.</p><br><p>Wilfred lit the next cigarette, smoked it completely, and looked away with a thoughtful look. It was evident that it helped him calm down and gather his thoughts.</p><br><p>"Fine, you are right, human lives are not the only thing we Black Swan care about. However, our and especially my reasons are none of your business, right?" Wilfred uttered, slowly shifting his gaze from the night sky to Adam.</p><br><br><p>Even though Wilfred didn't let out his aura and seemed no different from a normal person, Adam felt a strange pressure. It definitely wasn't an ability or an aura, he was sure of that.</p><br><p>It seemed to be something else, yet more simple and even trivial. This pressure came from pure wisdom or pure confidence in his words. Adam couldn't determine the cause, in a way, it was something new and uncharted for him.</p><br><p>"You don't have to worry about why exactly we want to get rid of Aiden Henk, as long as you have the same goal, do you?" Wilfred asked with a deadly serious expression.</p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily, the reason wasn't his next words but his acceptance of the situation.</p><br><p>"You want to kill him, right? Not that it's against my moral principles, not anymore, but... I need clarity. Is that what you can give me?"</p><br><p>Wilfred flicked the ashes directly onto the floor, smirking.</p><br><p>"Not anymore? Hah, so forty days ago, you had doubts? Well... If you think about it, it's not surprising. I was like that once too." Wilfred smiled bitterly, then his gaze turned cold.</p><br><p>Wilfred nodded, "Yes. We'll kill him. The fact that he's murdering people and experimenting on Phantoms is more than enough, regardless of our other reasons."</p><br><p>"I see... The enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?"</p><br><p>"Exactly." Wilfred smirked, flicked out his cigarette, and took a step forward, plunging into the darkness.</p><br><p>Adam didn't bother saying anything or trying to catch up with Wilfred, because as soon as Wilfred moved, Adam realized it was pointless.</p><br><p>'Black Swan... Learning about them from the Upper Ring is difficult, at least for me and Silvana. We don't have enough power for that.' Adam inwardly muttered, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.</p><br><p>He pondered whether he could have been told more about Black Swan by someone he knew. Sure, he could just ask everyone, but that would be the stupidest thing to do.</p><br><p>Also, he could try to find out something from Tron or even ask Damien about it, but... Adam wasn't ready to talk to them about it and his goals.</p><br><p>However... Adam had one option.</p><br><p>"Right..." Adam muttered with a slight smile on his face, "Zera, then those photos ended up on the flash drive for a reason. Even if she doesn't have any classified information, she must know something."</p><br><p>The darkness grew denser while the moon slowly moved across the sky aiming to reach the horizon line.</p><br><p>With the next dawn, millions of people returned to their duties, some to the academy, others to work, or the Dead Lands to kill monsters. Everyone performed their task to keep this complex mechanism functioning.</p><br><p>However, people were not robots, which was both a benefit and a disadvantage, to recover from the usual routine work or mortal combat needed a rest and to have fun with friends.</p><br><p>Adam was no exception, although he had released some of his tension during the fair, Fall Hill Prison was a long and difficult challenge, comparable to Eclipse or the battle against the Steel Knight.</p><br><p>In a way, Adam was a lucky man, because he had plenty of people to invite to the party.</p><br><p>Everything was ready, so everyone just had to gather in one place, because the party was going to start in an hour - in one of the expensive restaurants in the First Ring.</p><br><br><p>Adam walked slowly toward the building, which was almost as tall as a skyscraper, but he didn't go any further, because he was waiting for someone.</p><br><p>Soon, the door opened, and out stepped a girl with shoulder-length black hair, wearing a gorgeous dress and a few pieces of jewelry to accentuate her elegance.</p><br><p>Anyone who saw this girl at that moment would thought she often wore dresses and had a sense of fashion, but... to Adam, it was like seeing a white crow - equally rare and surprising.</p><br><p>"Is something wrong?" Silvana asked, fixing her hair.</p><br><p>Adam was too used to seeing her in formal clothes and without jewelry. So, it took him a while to adjust.</p><br><p>"Nah, it's okay. Shall we go?"</p><br><p>"Sure." Silvana replied with a serious expression. The dress, jewelry, and light makeup couldn't change her personality. She was still the same.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana got into the car and headed straight to First Ring. They had to take the trains to get there on time, but Adam decided to pay more to get on the special route.</p><br><p>"Oh, we got here a little early." Silvana muttered, checking the time.</p><br><p>"Well, looks like someone made the same mistake, and somehow I'm not surprised at all." Adam smirked, looking at the girl with long green hair. Oddly enough, this time Kayla wore a white dress that accentuated her curves - she clearly followed Edir's advice.</p><br><p>Adam quickened his step.</p><br><p>"Hey. Kayla!" Adam waved his hand with a pleased smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Kayla turned as her eyes went wide, "Adam!"</p><br><p>It seemed that she had been here much longer than she should, and was glad to see the first person - knowing that this time no one had abandoned her and she could enjoy the party with people who could become her friends.</p><br><p>'Oh... So that's what she's like in real life.' Silvana muttered to herself, immediately realizing what kind of person Kayla was, 'This is very different from what I saw in her profile. At least from the information I've been able to get.'</p>
