            <br><p>After an hour of travel, they hadn't even gone half the distance to reach the Fallen Ring Castle. The lava river seemed endless.</p><br><p>Adam leaned forward, patting Vorx's head.</p><br><p>"So, since Arnoth and Kreyna are only waiting to complete missions and enough sacrifices to gather energy, they don't control every second of your life, right?"</p><br><p>"Yes, they are stronger than us, but they don't have as many subordinates to watch over every serpent. Thanks to that, I'll be able to secretly bring you to the scarlet cliff, not far from the Fang Spire."</p><br><p>"The scarlet cliff? The Fang Spire? What is that?" Adam asked.</p><br><p>Vorx smiled bitterly. "The common places in the castle grounds. There are a total of two spires: the Fang Spire and the Tail Spire. Next to each spire are four ring towers. Above each ring tower hovers one to four stone rings. You know, it's kind of like dividing into territories.</p><br><p>"We may be monsters, but we're smart enough and know how to communicate with each other to live in caves or some holes like wild animals. It's a long way from your human society, but we've managed to create something decent."</p><br><p>Adam wondered how Vorx and the rest of the serpents did it. He understood that they could use some abilities or powerful External Artifact, but... the serpents didn't have arms or legs or any tools to create structures.</p><br><p>"Khm..." he coughed. "What about the scarlet cliff? Are you going to hide me there until I'm ready to fight?"</p><br><p>"Yes. Some time ago, at the scarlet cliff, in a lake near the slope, not only crystals but essences were harvested. The special conditions allowed a small amount of energy not only to condense and turn into crystals as it does in the caves but also to remain in its natural form. As you can imagine, this was an efficient source of energy for Arnoth."</p><br><p>"And Arnoth drained the place in the first instance?" Adam suggested.</p><br><p>"Pfffft!" Risha snorted. "That's stupid! Why absorb all of your most valuable resources at once?"</p><br><p>"Hah..." Vorx chuckled, a hint of gloom in his voice. "Kreyna wanted to do it, but not Arnoth. Though he's cruel and an enemy of my folk, I can't deny he's a lot smarter and wiser than that bitch."</p><br><p>Vorx grunted. "Sure, after the battle ended, some of the most valuable energy sources, such as the scarlet cliff, were used, but Arnoth quickly put a stop to that. He realizes it's better to use resources from such places gradually."</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam's eyes grew deeper, visualizing Arnoth's frightening image. "Arnoth's people come to the scarlet cliff and other similar places only once in a while. When enough resources accumulate."</p><br><br><p>"It's worth recognizing that Arnoth did the smart thing. Instead of cutting down the tree and taking all the fruit at once, he bides his time, gathering the crop and repeating the process time after time. He has to sacrifice something, he can't take everything and get 100%, but this tactic will pay off quickly."</p><br><p>Adam rubbed his chin.</p><br><p>"Got it. You're going to hide me at the scarlet cliff. How much time will we have to prepare before Arnoth's men get there to collect the crystals and essences?"</p><br><p>"The Light Legion," Vorx said firmly.</p><br><p>Confusion reflected on Adam's face. "Agh?"</p><br><p>"That's what they call themselves. It's a multitude of monsters reporting to Arnoth and acting on Kreyna's orders. We'll have fifteen to twenty days. They usually come to the scarlet cliff lake once a month."</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head. "Wait... Even if no one from Light Legion is there, wouldn't that be suspicious? You were given a mission to find a strong Phantom. It'll be strange if you come back with nothing."</p><br><p>"Oh, you don't have to worry about that. Last time, I brought a Phantom, who didn't even last ten seconds against Arnoth. I did so because I was simply afraid of failing to fulfill his assignment.</p><br><p>After that, I was somehow given more freedom. If I take a few weeks to find a worthy opponent, that's fine. I'll just occasionally make that trip from lava lake to the Fallen Ring Castle and report that the Phantoms were too weak."</p><br><p>"You think you won't have a problem because of that?" Adam scratched his cheek.</p><br><p>"Nah..." Vorx shook his head. "Maybe in a month or two, but we'll have time to prepare."</p><br><br><p>Risha exclaimed, drawing attention to herself.</p><br><p>"Get to the point! How are you going to prepare Adam for the fight against Arnoth? Considering the way you fear him, Arnoth is much stronger than you. Right now, Adam doesn't stand a chance against Arnoth, does he?"</p><br><p>With a brief pause, Vorx nodded. "Sure. But, Adam has potential and desire. That's why we need the free days. The minimum plan is for Adam to destroy the fourth lesser gates."</p><br><p>Adam and Risha exchanged glances, their eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"Don't be surprised. I knew before our fight that both of you destroyed the second lesser gates. To defeat me, Adam opened the third one, but it wasn't enough."</p><br><p>"You said it was a minimum plan... Hmm. Do you think I have a chance of opening the fifth lesser gates as well?"</p><br><p>Flames lit up in Adam's eyes as his heart began to beat faster. He didn't know what to expect, but he already took one step forward and was ready for more.</p><br><p>Vorx chuckled. "Hah... Maybe yes, maybe no. But, if I'm not wrong about you, then you will get to that stage, and you can do it during the fight against Arnoth. Just like you made the leap in strength against me."</p><br><p>A wide grin showed on Adam's face, full of excitement.</p><br><p>"Then what are we waiting for? Go for it! I'll not only save your folk but I'll shatter those fucking crystal gates! Hurry up!"</p><br><p>Risha bit her lip, looking enviously at Adam's joyful face.</p><br><p>"Hey...! What about me? I want to get in on this too."</p><br><p>"Heh... It's up to you," Vorx laughed briefly. "Open the third and fourth lesser gates, and maybe you and me can defeat Kreyna. That will be our part of the job."</p>
