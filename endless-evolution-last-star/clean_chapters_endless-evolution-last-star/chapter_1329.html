            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1329: Fall of Limits</strong></p><br><p>“What the hell is this?!” Adam exclaimed, pointing at the teddy bear, which looked threatening because it was Misty’s servant.</p><br><p>Misty grinned and jumped forward to hug the teddy bear.</p><br><p>“It’s Pokko! My favorite!”</p><br><p>In an instant, the fierce bear froze as it blushed from the praise from its owner.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow when Silvana contacted him.</p><br><p>“Hey, as awkward as this all looks, I don’t think you should relax. That teddy bear… is a summoned creature, and I doubt that Pokko is weak if Misty decided to summon it.”</p><br><p>Glancing at Misty and Pokko, Adam nodded deeply. He didn’t know the exact power level of anyone at the Black Cut he had met, but it was obvious to him that Misty was probably stronger than Narica, since she and Karso held the second position in the entire faction.</p><br><p>“Hey, am I really going to have to fight this teddy bear?” Adam asked, looking from Misty to Pokko.</p><br><p>Misty looked at him, continuing to snuggle up to Pokko, burying herself in his soft fur.</p><br><p>“Of course. I already explained everything to you. I’ll make sure you get stronger because that’s what the boss wants, but fighting me would be too dangerous for you.” She looked up. “Pokko will do a great job, I’m sure of it.”</p><br><p>At the same time, Norax approached Narica and put his hand on her shoulder.</p><br><p>“I think it’s time for us to go. See you in a week, Adam. Hahaha, I’m sure during that time you’ll regret wanting to replace Narica with another opponent.”</p><br><p>“Sir…” Narica placed her palm on her chest. “What are you…?”</p><br><p>Before she could finish, darkness engulfed them as they disappeared, leaving Adam and Misty alone.</p><br><p>Misty looked back as her gaze became more serious.</p><br><p>“Alright, now that the boss is gone, it’s time to start. Pokko, attack him until he can’t stand, but no further.”</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Pokko lunged forward, his expression changing from shy to fierce.</p><br><p>Now, it wasn’t a big teddy bear, but a menacing beast with an unusual appearance.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened as he crossed his arms over his chest, blocking Pokko’s attack. The bear’s fist knocked Adam aside, but Pokko wasn’t going to stop there. Despite his large size, he was able to move quickly and nimbly because he was essentially made up of darkness and Misty’s energy, nothing more.</p><br><p>Not wanting to lose too quickly, Adam’s eyes flashed as, in the next moment, a multitude of silver threads stopped Pokko’s red claws right in front of Adam’s face.</p><br><p>“GHR!” Pokko grunted, but despite his efforts, he couldn’t cut through Adam’s thread.</p><br><p>“Hmm…” Adam hummed inwardly, while more and more threads came out of the dicks, leaving Pokko with no hope of a successful attack.</p><br><p>“Ureyn easily cut my threads with his needle. Is it because Pokko is weaker than Ureyn, or because I have become stronger than I was?” Adam pondered, seemingly in no hurry to counterattack.</p><br><p>Misty stood quietly to the side, watching the battle. She knew what Pokko was capable of, but this was only the second time she had seen Adam fight.</p><br><p>“GHOOO!” Pokko roared as his eyes flashed brightly and flames covered his claws.</p><br><p>Adam’s threads couldn’t withstand this, burning under the beast’s onslaught.</p><br><p>Freeing his claws, Pokko attacked sharply, but Adam was ready for it. He dodged and directed energy to his fist.</p><br><p>His fist struck Pokko’s body like a bright star, passing through the thick layer of fur to his weak spot.</p><br><p>The impact passed through Pokko’s body several times before throwing the huge bear aside.</p><br><p>Pokko deftly flipped in the air and landed on his feet, but he did not have time to attack. A change occurred in Adam that no one expected.</p><br><p>‘Oh, how interesting.’ Misty narrowed her eyes, wanting to see what was beyond the border of Adam’s aura, deep within his inner space.</p><br><p>All she got was a brief glimpse before Adam’s inner space expelled her gaze, but that was more than enough.</p><br><p>“It doesn’t seem like Pokko’s attack pushed him to his limit, and his Energy Axis began to rapidly rebuild itself. It seems that his attitude toward the matter has more influence on his progress than the actual situation.” Misty surmised as Adam stretched out his arm.</p><br><p>With flashes of lightning, the Dual Demon Sword appeared in his grasp.</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam lunged forward, quickly finding himself in front of Pokko, who was not prepared for such a sudden change.</p><br><p>He, like a beast, could feel Adam’s aura growing right now. With each breath he took, he became stronger.</p><br><p>Misty was right in her theory. It was all about how Adam perceived it. When Pokko’s claws couldn’t do anything against his threads, he realized that Pokko was no match for him because his power had increased.</p><br><p>The Energy Axis just responded to his call, removing the restrictions on Adam’s power through the intertwining of threads. The Energy Axis did not diminish Adam’s power, but simply limited it to a safe degree.</p><br><p>If Adam’s entire essence felt that this was not enough, whether in a life-threatening situation or, conversely, in a situation like the current one, the Energy Axis was ready to give him more power, of course, up to a certain limit.</p><br><br><p>Adam swung his sword as Pokko jumped aside at the last moment so that the lightning blade would not cut him in pieces.</p><br><p>However, Adam was not going to stop there. Lightning ran through his body, forming an incomplete exoskeleton as his frame trembled.</p><br><p>He disappeared right before Pokko’s eyes.</p><br><p>All Pokko managed to do was turn to the side and sense Adam’s presence. It wasn’t enough. Adam moved too fast, and his detached gaze showed that he didn’t understand that Pokko wasn’t ready for this.</p><br><p>At the last moment, a small silhouette appeared in front of Pokko and stopped the wild beast that Adam had become with a cascade of sparks.</p><br><p>“Not bad.” Misty stared at Adam, holding his sword with her umbrella. “Is that only 50%? In that case, let’s continue until you break under your own weight.”</p><br><p>Adam didn’t mind, as his grip only tightened.</p>
