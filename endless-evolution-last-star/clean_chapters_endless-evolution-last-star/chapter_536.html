            <br><p>As the guests were arriving at the palace, the most important ones were already in the palace, and not in the banquet hall, but where only members of the Rouzet family and their servants could enter.</p><br><br><p>Mariel stepped forward on her high heels, Reinal walking beside her with a slight frown on his face.</p><br><p>On the opposite side of the long hallway, there were also two figures, but they were not members of the Rouzet Family or servants.</p><br><p>One of them was a middle-aged man with long brown hair divided into several locks, the sharp tips reaching his shoulders. His hazel eyes glistened with delight and he bore a satisfied smile on his face.</p><br><p>Stepping closer, Mariel was delighted and quickened her step.</p><br><p>"Zarot! You're finally here, it's so good to see you!" Mariel vigorously said, with a deep sigh.</p><br><p>Then, she extended her right hand forward, palm tilted slightly downward.</p><br><p>Zarot smirked, bowed low with a sweep of his hand, and kissed Mariel's palm.</p><br><p>"I hope the bride didn't cause any trouble. It won't be good if she decides to run away. Hahaha!" Zarot let out a satisfied laugh, echoing out further down the hallway.</p><br><p>Mariel's corners of her lips went up slightly, forming a predatory smile.</p><br><p>"Well, Osana is far from the most obedient child, but this is not something even she would go for. Osana knows the wedding can't be refused, though maybe it was her rebellious nature that attracted the groom, who knows?"</p><br><p>"Hahaha!" Zarot laughed again, keeping a hand on his stomach, "You may be right. Women like that, warrior ladies, have their charm!"</p><br><p>Mariel nodded and her gaze traveled to the right.</p><br><p>Standing next to Zarot was a tall girl, she had long, disheveled, brown hair that reached her waist with the same spiky tips as Zarot's. She had hazel eyes and a bored look. She didn't seem interested in this meeting between the older members of their families at all. She looked away, showing no initiative in their conversation.</p><br><p>"Istrid, it's good to see you, as well as your father." Mariel said in a low voice.</p><br><p>Then, Istrid finally turned around. She met Mariel's gaze and nodded deeply. Explore stories on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Me too. I honestly didn't want to come here." Istrid said nonchalantly.</p><br><p>No emotion appeared on Mariel's face at such a cold answer, but Reinal frowned heavily, glaring menacingly at Istrid.</p><br><p>"Why? As you know, you're always welcome in our home." Mariel swept her hand around, showing their palace.</p><br><p>Istrid only shrugged idly.</p><br><p>"What could possibly be interesting about a wedding? I've heard about that Osana from my brother hundreds of times already, they'll just get married and that's it, she just doesn't have any other choice."</p><br><p>Mariel was silent for a while, staring intently at Istrid. For some reason, she was being quite patient with her.</p><br><p>Istrid waved her hand, looking up at the ceiling - at the crystal chandelier hanging directly above her.</p><br><p>"Appetizers, alcohol, fine food, and dozens of nobles around... We have all of that at home or any other event. Nothing is interesting when the outcome is obvious and predictable."</p><br><p>Zarot glanced cautiously at Istrid, he didn't admonish her but realized that she shouldn't act like that even if what she was saying was true.</p><br><p>Mariel's eyebrow twitched, and a few wrinkles appeared on her skin covered in a thick layer of makeup, but after a moment her face returned to normal, to a slight smile.</p><br><p>However, it was enough for Reinal to notice.</p><br><br><p>A few big steps and Reinal was right in front of Istrid, staring menacingly straight into her eyes, they were the same height.</p><br><p>"What is it?" Istrid smirked, biting down on her pinky finger.</p><br><p>"Even if you're bored, you mustn't forget your fucking manners! You're in our home, in our palace! You can act rude to the other guests, but right now you're talking to Mariel De Rouzet. Show some respect."</p><br><p>Reinal uttered through gritted teeth, his fists were tightly clenched and his gaze remained intimidating.</p><br><p>"Hah, what if I refuse to follow your... advice? What then?" Istrid's eyes curved in a devious expression, "Do you want to fight me?"</p><br><p>Although Istrid was clearly confident in her abilities, Reinal had no intention of backing down, standing directly in front of her.</p><br><p>"Oh, how persistent you are, I like that and I also like the contrast between you and me."</p><br><p>Istrid smirked, leaning against Reinal, placing her arms on his shoulders as support.</p><br><p>"Even though we are on the same level, you're a Natural Phantom and I'm an Artificial Phantom, we both know you're going to lose."</p><br><p>Istrid licked her lips, running her finger along Reinal's chest.</p><br><p>"Poor thing, this must be so humiliating for you."</p><br><p>Istrid shook her head mockingly as if she was truly sorry.</p><br><p>A few muscles in Reinal's face twitched, but he remained calm, controlling his emotions.</p><br><p>Then, Istrid raised her hand, slowly stroking Reinal's cheek with the back of her palm.</p><br><p>"You know, if we switched places and I was Natural Phantom, I'd probably take you to my side. You'd be my sweet, weak husband who I could tease endlessly."</p><br><p>Istrid leaned down to Reinal's ear, whispering:</p><br><p>"And you couldn't do anything about it, because you can't break the rules. You'd be just like your sister right now..."</p><br><p>Reinal's patience seemed to be limitless, but as soon as Istrid spoke her last words, Reinal's face contorted in anger.</p><br><br><p>Reinal waved his hand irritably, with full force, he intended to wound Istrid.</p><br><p>Istrid's pupils narrowed as she instantly jumped back. Reinal's hand swept right in front of her face, rippling her hair.</p><br><p>"Pfffft, why so nervous? Unfortunately, I can't make you mine, at least not until you want me to." Istrid smiled slyly before looking out the window.</p><br><p>Then, her eyes went wide as if she saw something that shouldn't be there. Her bored look was filled with rich colors.</p><br><p>"Hah, looks like I should apologize for my words. This wedding won't be boring."</p><br><br><p>With a nervous step, Mariel walked to the window.</p><br><p>"What the hell...? What are they doing here?"</p><br><p>Mariel said through gritted teeth as she stared at Franz, Nelya, and Rosalind heading towards the palace entrance.</p>
