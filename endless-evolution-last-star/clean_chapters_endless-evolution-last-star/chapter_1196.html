            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1196: Knights and Ashes (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>For many people, motivation was crucial to keep them going.</p><br><p>Adam was not one of those people.</p><br><p>Sure, he had goals, ambitions, and desires on various levels. However, he couldn’t just see something and be motivated to do it for the sake of the idea rather than for some benefit.</p><br><p>Usually, someone else became the motivation for most people. It could be a family member, a friend, or even an enemy in rare cases.</p><br><p>However, that wasn’t the case for Adam either. He could be a motivation for his younger sister and parents, but not the other way around.</p><br><p>He had many acquaintances among the Phantoms, but he wasn’t sure he could call any of them a close friend.</p><br><p>Was Fromund an exception?</p><br><br><p>They had only met twice, which was not enough for a strong friendship to develop, but Adam couldn’t help but feel that Fromund’s motivation and excitement were contagious.</p><br><p>“Hah, just look at him…” Adam smiled bitterly as he threw the Kirani Knight aside. “He absorbed the crystal, became stronger, and now he’s ready to fight to the last drop of blood.”</p><br><p>“Hahaha, don’t worry, we’ll find a crystal for you as well soon. First, we need to deal with these two!”</p><br><br><p>The Kirani Knights’ frames shook as they stood side by side, shoulder to shoulder.</p><br><p>“Why?” The first knight asked furiously. “Don’t you have enough resources elsewhere? Why did you come to us?”</p><br><br><p>“You have only yourselves to blame for that, well… or your leader. Considering that you are insects, you must have a queen, right? So it’s all her fault.”</p><br><p>The second knight’s eyes filled with rage.</p><br><p>“Don’t you dare speak of the Queen in that tone!”</p><br><p>The first knight, who was wounded, was more restrained.</p><br><p>“Young man… What do you mean?”</p><br><p>Adam took a deep breath as he pointed behind him to the place where the Twilight Crystal had recently been.</p><br><p>“Twilight Crystals. Even though Fromund absorbed one, I feel that there are several more around, at least three! Hell, there are four Twilight Crystals on your territory, and you’re surprised why we came here?!”</p><br><p>In fact, the Kirani Knights understood that there was nothing unusual about this.</p><br><p>The problem was something else—until now, they had always killed intruders without any problems. The Kirani Knights couldn’t remember the last time they had to fight.</p><br><p>What’s more, they were losing!</p><br><p>“In short, if you weren’t so greedy and had absorbed the Twilight Crystals, none of this would have happened. We would have invaded another territory because everyone in this world needs resources. You monsters should know that better than anyone.”</p><br><p>The Kirani Knights had no answer. However, they didn’t need one. They could feel a powerful aura approaching.</p><br><p>Soon, Bathild would be here, and then it would all be over.</p><br><br><p>Their conversation could have continued, but as soon as Fromund stepped forward, all attention was focused on him. Especially on his spear, around which two flame rings hovered.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened for a moment. He had seen what one ring was capable of, now it was time for something more serious.</p><br><br><p>Fromund thrust his spear into the ground as the two rings trembled.</p><br><p>Two streams of flame shot out to the sides, forming a ring that became an arena that could not be entered or exited.</p><br><p>Several Kirani Bugs tried to fly through the fiery barrier to help the knights, but the flames simply burned them, leaving only bits of ash.</p><br><p>“What have you done, human? You’ve lost your weapon!” The second knight exclaimed mockingly. He thought Fromund’s decision was foolish.</p><br><p>The knight did not yet know how wrong he was.</p><br><p>“Yes, my whole body is a weapon, that won’t be a problem. However… I don’t want to stain my fists with your blood.”</p><br><p>The Kirani Knights were puzzled.</p><br><br><p>Fromund waved his hand as fiery orbs appeared at the edge of the arena. At his command, fiery spears shot out of them, moving at tremendous speed.</p><br><p>Thanks to their lightning-fast reactions, the Kirani Knights managed to jump back as two spears whizzed past them.</p><br><p>The weaker bugs watching the battle from the sidelines couldn’t even make out the spears. They only saw lines of flame shooting at the knights like lasers.</p><br><p>“Adam, we need to end this right now. That aura… It’s getting closer and closer. I don’t know how, but you need to absorb the Twilight Crystal as well before that creature arrives.”</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam’s expression grew serious as he gripped his rods more tightly.</p><br><p>“You think I could lose?”</p><br><br><p>Silvana didn’t lie to him. There was no reason to.</p><br><p>“It’s definitely an Elder, I can feel it. And this one is more dangerous than Lyrod. He was a novice at this level of power, but the same cannot be said for the owner of this aura.”</p><br><p>Without saying a word, Adam nodded and stepped forward.</p><br><p>“Hey, let’s take care of them and find the second Twilight Crystal,” Adam said as he stood next to Fromund.</p><br><br><p>“This time, you’re in the vanguard. Do whatever you want with them, I’ll help you.”</p><br><p>He didn’t need any further confirmation. Adam lunged forward, instantly finding himself in front of the Kirani Knights.</p><br><p>They had fought evenly before, but now everything was different.</p><br><br><p>Adam blocked their swords as he ducked, letting the blades pass over his head. Then, he grabbed the second knight and drove the rod into his leg.</p><br><p>“ARGH!” A painful groan echoed through the cave, but it was only the first step.</p><br><p>Adam ended up behind the second knight and pushed him in the shoulder. Before the knights could figure out what was happening, Adam used the power of his rods and moved toward the second knight, causing a fiery explosion.</p><br><p>“Damn!” Fromund exclaimed. “Since when did he have such abilities? Hah, that flame, I want one just like it!”</p><br><br><p>The second knight exclaimed in rage, preparing to pounce on Adam.</p><br><br><p>The first knight tried to stop him, knowing what would happen next, but it was too late.</p><br><p>Fromund waved his hand as two flaming spears pierced their bodies from different sides, twice.</p><br><p>All the Kirani Knights could do was look at each other, burning in the flames and turning to ash.</p>
