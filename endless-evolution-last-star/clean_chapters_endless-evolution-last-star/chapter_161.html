            <br><p>"What...? Adam, I don't think you realize how difficult this is..." Narata muttered with a happy smile.</p><br><p>She was glad that there was someone who could understand her, but one couldn't just get rid of the Phantom status and become someone else.</p><br><p>Phantom, unlike Blacksmith, Operator, or Harvester, was not a profession. It couldn't be learned in a few years at the academy and change professions if desired. A military man could become a medic, a Harvester could become an Operator, but the Phantom could not become anything else - it was a blessing and a curse.</p><br><p>If such a fate was the dream of the one, then it was a blessing, and if it was someone like Narata, then it was a true punishment from the heavens.</p><br><p>Adam was silent for a while, eyes closed and pondering something. It seemed he had some option, and that gave Narata hope.</p><br><p>"Narata... You joined Azure Lotus because it allowed you to be here, and as a Phantom not wanting to be a Phantom, you're close to their ideology of complete equality, aren't you?" Adam asked, trying to make sense of the situation.</p><br><p>Narata nodded uncertainly.</p><br><p>"They don't know my true reasons, so... yes, to some extent, I used them."</p><br><p>Adam smirked, then he remembered Tron's words. He hardly knew a situation like this would happen, but Adam could take advantage of it.</p><br><p>"Hah, you're smart, but... you picked the wrong organization." Adam smiled slyly, "You should use their rules and ideology to get out of your situation."</p><br><p>Narata tilted her head in confusion.</p><br><p>"Look. Obviously, there's no way for you to go to Crimson Path. They praise the Phantoms and their bloodlines. I can't know for sure, but something tells me that for Crimson Path, a Phantom not wanting to be a Phantom is like a heretic refusing a blessing." Adam explained.</p><br><p>Narata nodded. She knew this, for she had been considering for a long time which organization to join.</p><br><p>"There is only one option left out of the Big Three - the Dark Order." Adam said as if that was the answer to her problem.</p><br><p>"Dark Order... Adam, they glorify strength. To them, the most important thing is power, everything else is not as important as pure power... A weak Phantom afraid of monsters like me will be nothing but a target for them to mock." Narata muttered with evident bitterness in her gaze.</p><br><p>Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>"You're wrong. Their basic idea is that the Phantom can get and do anything, depending on his strength. If you're as strong as Damien, you can do anything you want, if you're weak, then your options are severely limited."</p><br><p>Narata didn't say anything, she just listened to him carefully with hope in her gaze.</p><br><p>"But, who says being weak is bad? Maybe being weak gives you fewer opportunities than being strong, but... everyone gets what their strength deserves." Adam uttered.</p><br><p>Then, he smirked and pointed at Narata.</p><br><p>"You are weak, and you have no desire to be powerful. In that case, wouldn't it be better to serve as Operator to some Phantom who is vastly superior to you? Moreover, I take it you don't need to go through the study again, right?"</p><br><p>Narata nodded vigorously.</p><br><p>"Is that really possible? If so, I won't even have to rebuild my Nexus... my weapons will be help and information, not a huge piece of metal..." Narata muttered, biting her lip almost to the point of bleeding.</p><br><p>Adam put his hands behind his head and said with a careless smile: "I don't know."</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Narata's eyes went wide, "You were so confident about it!"</p><br><p>Adam shrugged, "Well, this is the first time I've encountered something like this, so... I think we need help."</p><br><br><br><p>Adam tapped his bracelet, calling Silvana. He wasn't worried that anyone could overhear them, since if it was done via the bracelet, Narata would have asked him to take it off before entering the room.</p><br><p>'Yes? Is something happening? Silvana answered quickly, not even ten seconds had passed.</p><br><p>"Well... Something unusual. Do you have any way to contact Damien? At least leave him or Beth a message. Also, if that doesn't work, try contacting Tron."</p><br><p>'Fine, do I need to give them a message?'</p><br><br><p>"It's a long story, so listen carefully, hopefully, Tron and Damien will understand us correctly." Adam cast a glance at Narata.</p><br><p>She was clearly nervous, but she didn't stop him. After what she'd heard, she was willing to risk sharing her story with those who could, in theory, change her life.</p><br><p>Time was running out.</p><br><p>Silvana hadn't been able to contact Damien or Beth, which wasn't surprising. They were busy people, and Adam was just an acquaintance, nothing more.</p><br><p>But... Tron responded rather quickly, Silvana had his contacts after Tron had saved Adam's squad after the battle with the Phantoms from the Lower Ring.</p><br><p>Moreover, after realizing the situation Tron was able to do what Adam and Silvana couldn't - contact Damien. They were from the same organization, so for Tron, it was much easier.</p><br><br><p>Adam's bracelet flashed as a 3D model of Damien appeared who was wearing a strange costume - both light and heavy, covering some parts of his body and leaving others exposed. Apparently, he was now somewhere in Dead Lands for some mission.</p><br><p>"Hey, I'm a bit busy, but Tron explained everything to me. Meet him in three days. And... as an afterthought..." Damien paused briefly, "It's possible."</p><br><p>Then, Damien disconnected, they obviously wouldn't be able to contact him again anytime soon.</p><br><p>Sure, the issue hasn't been resolved yet, and there may be problems ahead, but... Damien's last words were enough for Narata's heart to start beating faster and her eyes to shine brightly.</p><br><p>"YEAH!!!!" Narata exclaimed happily, jumping on Adam with her arms spread out.</p><br><p>She clutched him tightly, unable to contain her emotions. It seemed to her that her nightmare and curse were finally beginning to pass, and it was all only because of Adam and his persistence.</p><br><p>"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!" Narata repeated, pressing Adam's head hard against her chest.</p><br><p>Adam's hands came in motion, heading towards Narata, and about to pull her away, but... he stopped, dropping his hands with a bitter smile, on his face.</p><br><p>"Oh... I'm sorry, I... I was just too nervous..." Narata stepped back. She calmed down a bit only after a couple of minutes.</p><br><p>"It's alright. So... in three days, your fate will be decided, right?" Adam smiled, glancing at Narata and her breasts, between which his face was clutched. It wasn't noticeable under her military uniform, but Narata possessed something other women might envy.</p><br><p>"Ughum." Narata nodded, but soon her eyes went wide, "Wait... three days? Even if you made it to the A-Zone, you still have a month to go... I can't do it without you..."</p><br><p>Adam looked up with a slight smile.</p><br><p>"Well, I don't know if Damien said that on purpose, but I think I'll be out of here pretty soon. I'm sure... Right now, I'm missing something interesting, so... I guess I'll head back to the A-Zone." Adam said, heading towards the exit.</p><br><p>He wasn't wrong, because Edir wasn't going to wait for Adam, who had mysteriously disappeared. Edir was already fighting against the Guardian of the A-Zone.</p>
