            <br><p>’What the hell...? Is such a thing possible...?’
</p><br><p>Only a few brief thoughts filled Adam’s mind, his gaze fixed on a single point - the meteorite approaching him.
</p><br><p>He wasn’t the only one whose eyes were wide open.
</p><br><p>None of the spectators had expected Fromund’s Second Order to be so devastating.
</p><br><p>The especially attentive ones noticed how the meteorite was forming. As Fromund’s hand raised upward and his eyes flashed, several particles of flame appeared high in the sky, far above the clouds.
</p><br><p>Very quickly, the energy turned into a ring of fire, the meteorite as if from a portal emerged in all its power.
</p><br><p>The distance was still great, but Adam could already feel the intense heat as if standing in front of a large bonfire at the peak of activity.
</p><br><p>Silvana gasped, covering her mouth with the palm of her hand.
</p><br><p>"Wait... Fromund... Is he going to kill him?!"
</p><br><p>Then, without waiting for an answer or excuse, Silvana abruptly turned around and grabbed Arayna by the collar, effortlessly lifting her off the ground.
</p><br><p>They were both mere humans, but Silvana’s physical condition greatly surpassed Arayna’s.
</p><br><p>An irritated grimace covered Arayna’s face.
</p><br><p>"What the hell are you doing!"
</p><br><p>But... the moment she saw Silvana’s furious face a lump stuck in her throat, she could no longer say anything.
</p><br><p>"Be quick, explain to me what’s going on here?"
</p><br><p>Arayna didn’t answer at first, she wasn’t used to being in this situation, and... no one rushed to help her.
</p><br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda only looked at each other in confusion, they didn’t expect Silvana to attack Arayna suddenly.
</p><br><p>Perhaps in any other situation, they would have intervened, after all, there were three of them, but... something in Silvana’s gaze stopped them.
</p><br><p>There was no anger in her eyes, more panic and worry.
</p><br><br><p>Arayna understood that as well because she was an Operator too.
</p><br><p>"Silvana... Put me down. I, like you, can’t change anything. What Fromund did was his decision. It’s his Second Order, all by the rules they both agreed to."
</p><br><p>"But! It’s a fucking meteorite! It’s flying right into the arena! Fuck!"
</p><br><p>The furious shout didn’t help the situation in any way but allowed Silvana to let her emotions out.
</p><br><p>She was well aware that what she was doing was wrong and Arayna was right.
</p><br><br><p>Shaking her head with a dark look, Silvana took a few steps back, letting go of Arayna’s collar.
</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."
</p><br><p>A few heavy sighs were enough for Silvana to return to normal.
</p><br><p>With an apologetic face, she looked up at Arayna.
</p><br><br><p>Arayna didn’t bother to accept her apology, instead, she turned and pointed at Adam, who had stopped shaking.
</p><br><p>"Pay more attention to your Phantom rather than the Operator of your Phantom’s opponent. We have no way to influence the fight from the spectator seats, but... we can watch like everyone else."
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, she added:
</p><br><p>"I’m sure. You can tell whether Adam is worried, scared, or delighted by his smallest reaction or just by the look in his eyes."
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, this had a profound effect on Silvana.
</p><br><p>She gulped, her cheeks flushed slightly not from embarrassment but from shame. She considered herself more experienced than Arayna, but in the end, it was Arayna who reminded her of such basic things.
</p><br><p>Putting her palm to her chest, Silvana looked at Adam who still hadn’t moved from his seat. He was staring wide-eyed at the approaching meteorite as if he had accepted his fate.
</p><br><p>’Adam... What are you thinking at a moment like this? You need to act... A simple swing of your sword could kill you, but... that thing.’
</p><br><p>She looked up for a moment.
</p><br><p>’At best you’ll lose in a heartbeat, more likely you’ll just be destroyed...’
</p><br><p>Then, Adam’s pupils narrowed, something changed in the depths, and another silhouette appeared instead of the reflection of the meteor.
</p><br><br><br><p>Of all the things Adam had encountered before, there was only one that looked like a meteorite fall - the emergence of the Essence Scarlet Pyromancer, a massive flame beetle falling from the heavens to the ground while the claws and jaws of the Gray Stalkers tried to tear its chitin apart.
</p><br><p>’Think Adam... What would you do if that day, Scarlet Pyromancer was falling right on top of us? What if it wasn’t because of a spatial anomaly, but was his attack?’
</p><br><p>His eyes closed before quickly opening, now instead of a rushing meteorite he saw a dangerous Essence Monster.
</p><br><p>’There’s nowhere to run away... I’m in an arena, this is an enclosed space and I’m unlikely to even scratch the protective barrier.’
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Energy raged within, rushing through his entire body in a powerful flow, ready for action just waiting for the right command.
</p><br><p>’Would I try to block Scarlet Pyromancer’s fall?’
</p><br><p>Adam inwardly shook his head immediately dismissing this foolish idea.
</p><br><p>’Maybe physically I could block his legs, but not a flaming blast. It would take something special to repel such an attack... there’s nothing suitable in my arsenal.’
</p><br><p>The corners of his lips curved up, forming a bitter smile.
</p><br><p>Defending himself, running away, dodging and reflecting the meteor he couldn’t do anything of that, so Adam was left with the only option:
</p><br><p>’Right, if I had an Essence Scarlet Pyromancer instead of a meteorite, then I would have tried to kill it, just destroy it.’
</p><br><p>At the same moment, the energy from his gauntlets hurriedly came out and his blue eyes shone brightly turning into two white stars.
</p><br><p>"Fortunately, my opponent isn’t a monster. Unlike the flame beetle, a piece of burning stone can’t dodge."
</p><br><p>Excitement was reflected in his gaze as well as the long needle, the middle of which was no longer empty but filled with pure energy.
</p><br><p>Standing to the side Fromund raised an eyebrow in disbelief.
</p><br><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, bent his knees, and looked up sharply.
</p><br><p>The tips of his black hair caught fire, the heat of the meteor making it smoke like hundreds of tiny embers.
</p><br><p>The arena barrier blocked the heat, otherwise, many of the spectators would be forced to run away in fear, their skin would have burned long ago.
</p><br><p>Adam was a Phantom, that was the sole reason why only his hair had been affected so far.
</p><br><br><p>Using all the energy of his artifact, Adam jumped high up, transforming into an electric flash.
</p><br><p>Once in the air, a few meters away from the meteorite, the effect of his needle’s special attack, his First Order, kicked in.
</p><br><p>A snow-white stream traveled from the tip, reaching Adam’s wrist.
</p><br><p>It no longer mattered where he was or which way he was attacking.
</p><br><p>All that mattered was his target and the path to reach or destroy it would be paved in any way.</p>
