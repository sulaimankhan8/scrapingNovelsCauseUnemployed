            <br><p>Some time ago, the gate to Fortress of the Lone Serpent opened, letting in a single Phantom. It didn't have much effect on such a large facility, with a hundred different monsters roaming the many levels, but soon they sensed that something was wrong.</p><br><p>Muffled screams, sounds of struggle, and vivid pain echoed from the depths, instilling doubt and slight fear into the minds of the monsters.</p><br><p>However, none of them knew or saw what was happening, it was only available to the hunter and the victim.</p><br><br><p>A long piece of flesh, a massive tongue ripped into fibers under the firm grip of two powerful hands.</p><br><p>The silver gleam flashed from one side to the other, cutting the monster's flesh apart with such great speed and ferocity that the monster had no chance of fighting back.</p><br><p>Slash. Slash. Slash.</p><br><p>A multitude of white lines, deep lightning cuts appeared on the wall. In a heartbeat, the wall shattered into stone rubble, releasing thick streams of dark blood.</p><br><p>The blood flowed down the passageways like rivers, leaving the battlefield - wanting to let everyone know what happened on the lower level.</p><br><br><p>Black boots partially submerged in pools of blood caused the surface to shiver, reflecting a tall silhouette with cold blue eyes.</p><br><br><p>With a deep sigh, Adam let out a stream of steam raising his left hand. His fingers trembled slightly, revealing a clenched fist.</p><br><p>A multitude of sharp teeth belonging to the unusual monster.</p><br><p>Behind Adam's back was nothing less than carnage, jaws broken and twisted at strange angles, and the monster's flesh cut and torn apart.</p><br><p>"Silvana... What the hell was that bastard?" Adam calmly said while looking around at what was left of the monster.</p><br><p>Soon, he heard the uncertain voice of his Operator.</p><br><p>'It... it shouldn't be... It's the Stone Mimic, or rather one of their subspecies... They're quite powerful and dangerous monsters, but there are no instances in the database indicating their appearance in the fortress...'</p><br><p>Her voice trembled and her eyes quickly ran from side to side trying to find any information, yet she was not successful even after several minutes.</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam nodded deeply before directing his gaze downward.</p><br><p>The flaming thread was still leading him forward, over Stone Mimic's corpse further into the depths of the fortress.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, some of the walls shuddered, and long arms came forward with wide jaws.</p><br><p>Enjoy more content from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Adam frowned, watching as several more Stone Mimics emerged from the walls, they slowly turned in his direction but were in no hurry to attack.</p><br><p>Adam was ready for a fight, after all, he couldn't let them chase him, but after a few seconds, it became clear that the Stone Mimics had a different task.</p><br><p>Their long tongues tumbled out of their large mouths, dragging across the floor because they were too big.</p><br><p>Then, paying no attention to Adam, the Stone Mimics began pounding on the walls with their skinny fists but long fingers.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>In this unremarkable method, they woke up the other Stone Mimics, more and more of them filling the narrow passageways.</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that the walls and the maze itself did not consist of Stone Mimics, these monsters were just traps and about 1/20th of all the stone slabs on the walls.</p><br><p>"What the hell is going on here? They're not going to fight me, or they would've attacked me by now. At least I did." Adam muttered carefully watching the unusual monsters he saw for the first time.</p><br><p>In fact, the Stone Mimics were living walls, if six of them stood tightly together, on all sides, they would form a cube the size of a small room where a bed and a table with a chair could fit.</p><br><p>Silvana had no idea either, she knew about Stone Mimics, although they were quite rare and specific monsters, but she didn't understand what they were going to do in the fortress.</p><br><p>Soon, they both had their answers.</p><br><br><p>The Stone Mimics stopped, leaned forward, and pressed their hands tightly against the walls before simultaneously springing into action.</p><br><p>With a loud creak accompanied by a rumble, under the force of the Stone Mimics, the walls began to move.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide and his jaw was ready to drop to the floor.</p><br><p>"Holy shit... They're fucking moving the walls!"</p><br><p>Then, the realization came to Silvana.</p><br><p>'Adam... They're changing the maze. They're making it so that you can't go back again and... so that no one can follow you down the flaming thread...'</p><br><p>At the same moment, when Adam heard Silvana, his eyes traveled towards the flame thread.</p><br><br><p>With a thud, the two walls collided with each other, closing the passageway Adam walked through earlier.</p><br><p>As Silvana expected, the flame thread did not change its direction, it remained under the wall, which had no voids for tens or even hundreds of meters ahead, just a thick layer of solid stone.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>The rumbling continued, showing that the maze was being rapidly changed by the extraordinary workers who had done their job perfectly.</p><br><br><p>Several Stone Mimics passed in front of the shocked Adam, hurrying toward the far reaches of the maze to finish their mission.</p><br><p>They paid no attention to him.</p><br><p>Could Adam run after them and find the still untouched exits of the maze? Probably yes, but the problem was that he needed to keep going.</p><br><br><p>Unlike Adam immersed in his thoughts, the Stone Mimics wasted no time, three of them approached Adam, staring intently at him.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam raised an eyebrow before turning around.</p><br><p>Behind the Stone Mimic he had killed, there was a long passage leading even lower.</p><br><p>"I see... You should change this part of the maze as well."</p><br><p>A bitter smile appeared on his face as he shook his head.</p><br><p>"Hah, in that case, I won't bother you."</p><br><p>Waving his coat that remained completely unharmed unlike the Stone Mimic, Adam leaped forward, disappearing into the deep darkness.</p><br><p>The Stone Mimics shrugged and moved the walls together, closing the gap forever.</p>
