            <br><p>"Yes! I finally killed it!" Silvana exclaimed happily, leaning back in her chair.</p><br><p>On her screen was one of the popular video games aimed at an audience who preferred to use PCs rather than VR helmets.</p><br><p>After many attempts, she had finally defeated the first monster, and now she could go to the next level.</p><br><p>"Hah, I remember I wanted to play this game back when it was released, but back then I had serious preparation for the academy exams..." Silvana muttered with a bitter smile on her face.</p><br><p>Then, she looked at her watch, realizing that passed a few hours.</p><br><p>"Well, procrastination is quite enjoyable, but I shouldn't get too deep into it, right?" Silvana muttered before glancing at the screen.</p><br><p>A satisfied smirk appeared on her face.</p><br><p>"Hmm... If I go a little more than one level, it won't be a big deal, right?" Silvana muttered before moving her chair over to the table, her gaze became serious and focused.</p><br><br><br><p>Around this time, Adam walked down the street at a measured pace.</p><br><p>After yesterday he felt relieved. He'd given Lero's book to his sister and settled things with Jena, but... there were people in his life he wanted to devote time to, especially after being in Dead Lands for so much.</p><br><p>Sure, the fight against Plague Reaper hadn't been something long, but there was always a long recovery of several weeks after hard fights.</p><br><p>"Damn, if I'm not mistaken I haven't seen my family since I went hunting Thunder Demon for the essence..."</p><br><p>Adam muttered scratching the back of his head.</p><br><p>"Or did I visit them? Well, even if so it was quick, I guess I should apologize for my long absence..."</p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily about to text Silvana to help him, but... before turning on his NEP he stopped.</p><br><p>"No, I'm sure she's using her free time to her benefit, for something important, I shouldn't bother her about nothing, especially when she's had a chance to rest."</p><br><p>Then, with a confident nod, Adam started looking for stores where he could buy suitable gifts for his mother, father, and younger sister. Now, he had both the money and the opportunity to do so, so he didn't have to hold himself back.</p><br><br><p>With a face as pale as a sheet of paper, Glara took a few steps back, instinctively she got behind Gladius, trying to hide by his back and broad shoulders.</p><br><p>"Hey, I think you scared our lovely test subject. If she gets too nervous, it won't work." Gladius said with a slight smile on his face, turning to Aiden.</p><br><p>It seemed he was just about the only one in Morton Observatory who could speak so casually to Aiden Henk himself, who was like a god with complete authority here.</p><br><p>"You, Glara Fratto, the younger sister of the Lero Fratto, the one who recently died on a mission, aren't you?" Aiden asked, pointing his hand towards Glara.</p><br><p>Hiding behind Gladius's back, only part of her head was visible, her green eyes bulging slightly, but she felt as if Aiden could see right through her.</p><br><p>Glara didn't answer. All she could think about was the Spark Seeker, the scary monster hovering next to Aiden.</p><br><p>The monster's three yellow eyes looked around, and now and then they would stop on Glara, filling with curiosity. Then, her heart flooded with fear, she forgot how to breathe.</p><br><p>"Sweetie, I suggest you answer his question. If he gets angry, a fate worse than death awaits you." Gladius smiled weakly, with a slight wave of his hand.</p><br><p>Glara gulped. Enjoy new adventures from empire</p><br><p>"What...? And you won't stop him?"</p><br><p>Gladius sighed heavily, he shrugged and said quietly:</p><br><p>"Well, how can I explain it to you? He's in charge here, so if he orders me to kill you, I'll do it in a heartbeat."</p><br><br><p>Before Glara could say anything, Gladius turned around, swinging his coat, and his palm was on her cheek, gently stroking her.</p><br><p>"Just do as he says, and maybe the third option will actually happen." Gladius said in a soothing voice.</p><br><p>Hearing his words about the third option, Glara's look changed, and she nodded confidently.</p><br><p>"Glara Fratto, even if your situation is special, it doesn't mean you can waste my time for nothing. Answer the question." Aiden said sternly, showing that he would not repeat himself again.</p><br><br><p>With a nod, Glara stepped forward and put her palm to her chest, she wasn't going to hide behind Gladius's back like a scared puppy anymore.</p><br><p>"Yes, I am Glara Fratto, the only remaining child of the Fratto Family, and I want to become a Phantom!"</p><br><p>Aiden raised his head slightly, his amber eyes bright as majestic stars.</p><br><p>"Fine, I accept your answer. Now stand still, and let me see if you got the Spark." Aiden said in a low voice before waving his hand.</p><br><p>As soon as he stepped forward, the Spark Seeker pulled out his long tongue, licked its crooked teeth, and followed Aiden.</p><br><p>"What...? What are you guys talking about? I'm already 17, so I've had four tests, I haven't had the Spark detected. And... shouldn't that require you to put me under anesthesia to do everything like the medical department?" Glara suggested.</p><br><p>Aiden and Gladius glanced over, to them Glara was talking utter nonsense, they just forgot how examinations for the Spark went for commoners.</p><br><p>"Oh, I see... Well, the tests the doctors do for the Three Rings people are just an illusion. While you sleep because of the sedative the military brings in the Spark Seeker, who is capable of seeing the Spark. It's just humanity, though I don't see any practical sense in it." Aiden waved his hand slightly irritatedly.</p><br><p>Glara gulped, she realized that Aiden's explanation made sense. She had tried several times to ask the doctors after the procedure about how they detect the Spark in a person, but each time, she got a vague answer.</p><br><p>She was told that it was a complicated method and that without special knowledge, she wouldn't understand anything or that she needed to grow up.</p><br><p>But... now everything was falling into place, at least for Glara.</p><br><p>"Alright, let's get to it." Aiden said and glared at the Spark Seeker.</p><br><p>The monster seemed to understand him, so the Spark Seeker leisurely flew over to Glara, looking at her intently.</p><br><p>The Spark Seeker looked rather creepy, especially to an ordinary human, but... it was a fairly harmless monster, well, compared to most of the others.</p><br><p>There was no bloodlust or cruelty in the Spark Seeker's gaze, it stared at its targets with curiosity and interest, like an explorer.</p><br><p>However... only a Phantom or an experienced military personnel could understand this, Glara was a simple girl, so she trembled with fear, though she had enough courage not to run away.</p><br><p>Gladius didn't say anything, he just stood behind with a sly smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Aiden raised an eyebrow, seeing that the Spark Seeker was in no hurry to act.</p><br><br><p>His palm smashed into the monster's face, emitting a loud slap that echoed around the room.</p><br><p>"Piece of shit, stop staring at her like an appetizer and get to work already! I swear to god, if you weren't special and rare, I would replace you long ago!" Aiden shouted irritably.</p><br><p>The Spark Seeker flinched as his eyes filled with fear and he quickly sprang into motion, waving his tail.</p><br><p>Glara's eyes went wide. Just then she saw a seemingly impossible scene.</p><br><p>An ordinary man had punched and scolded the monster, moreover, it wasn't some desperate action on the brink of death, Aiden had acted confidently and tough.</p><br><p>Moreover, the Spark Seeker's gaze became as sad as a puppy who had once again upset its owner even though it was just curious and hadn't done anything wrong.</p><br><p>'Wait... Why...?' Glara inwardly muttered looking at the Spark Seeker who was slowly flying towards her, 'Why do I feel pity for it?! It's a monster!'</p><br><p>Gladius grinned widely, it seemed from Glara's gaze he could tell what she was thinking at that moment.</p><br><p>'Hah, her reaction is unsurprising, but there is an explanation for this unusual scene... since hardly the Spark Seeker is a monster among the two of them, at least on the inside.'</p><br><br><p>Not wanting to upset Aiden any further, the Spark Seeker directed its tail towards Glara, the wide glass crystal appearing in front of her chest.</p><br><p>Back in the day, Adam was in Glara's place. Then, the Spark Seeker couldn't see anything in him since he hadn't awakened the Spark and he wasn't a Phantom, but... what about Glara?</p><br><p>The crystal darkened as if becoming a portal to Glara's inner space, but... there was no bright flash in the darkness.</p><br><p>"Sprk..." The Spark Seeker let out a strange sigh, it seemed he just lost interest in Glara.</p><br><p>On an instinctive level, Glara realized that it shouldn't be like this. The Spark Seeker was a curious creature, if it got bored then... that was not a good sign for Glara.</p><br><p>"Oh, looks like we were wrong."</p><br><p>Gladius said stepping forward and glancing at the glass crystal.</p><br><p>"You thought Glara might have the Spark because of the strange glint in her eyes and Lero's Nexus shivering, but unfortunately it's not that simple."</p><br><p>"Agh...? What are you talking about?" Glara muttered, her voice filled with despair, the opportunity to become a Phantom was slipping from her grasp.</p><br><p>Aiden took a step forward.</p><br><p>"I've decided that because of a strange connection involving you, Adam Vinter, that is, another Phantom and the Nexus of your blood brother who was also a Phantom but a dead one, you might get the Spark. It's a unique case, which is why I brought you here right away."</p><br><p>Aiden glanced at Glara, slipping a hand into the pocket of his white coat.</p><br><p>"However... Gladius, you're wrong."</p><br><p>Gladius raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>"What? What are you talking about?"</p><br><p>Gladius was pretty sure that Glara didn't have the Spark, after all, the glass crystal of the Spark Seeker couldn't reveal it.</p><br><p>Aiden stepped closer gazing intently at the crystal.</p><br><p>"We've encountered a more complicated situation. If one doesn't have the Spark, the crystal remains transparent, but... this time the crystal turned black since it shows us Glara's inner space."</p><br><p>Gladius's eyes went wide, this was something he had never encountered before.</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Aiden sighed thoughtfully, rubbing his chin, "There's the inner space, but no the Spark, curious."</p><br><p>Then, he looked at Glara, there was no tension or threat, just a trivial suggestion: "Glara, don't you want to kill the monster?"</p>
