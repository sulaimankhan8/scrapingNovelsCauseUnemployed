            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1281: Ugly Spider? (Part 2)</strong></p><br><br><p>Adam walked through the cobwebs, looking around. There was a rustling sound in the distance, but he hadn’t seen anyone yet.</p><br><p>“Now, what awaits me? Spiders?” Adam raised an eyebrow as he looked at the dense web.</p><br><p>He wasn’t surprised to see moths at Gareyna’s mill, and spiders as well. It was what he had expected when he first learned about the Forgotten Mills and the purpose of the Connected String.</p><br><p>After all, even though he was human, he knew how to use threads as well. It wasn’t a web, but it was pretty close.</p><br><p>“But… Arachne? What is that anyway?”</p><br><p>Silvana sighed heavily. “I don’t think you’ll like it. It’s a mixture of a woman and a spider. So… Nollura will look something like this.”</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam used the shared vision as he saw several screens in front of him through Silvana’s eyes.</p><br><p>In the center was a large monster, a dark spider with eight legs with sharp tips. However, instead of a spider’s head and jaws, which would be expected, Adam saw the upper part of a female body, very similar to a normal human woman, except for the monster jaw and six eyes.</p><br><p>For the first time in a long time, Adam’s face contorted in disgust.</p><br><p>He was not one to be repulsed by the appearance of monsters or have any issues with them, but this was an exception.</p><br><p>“Damn it! Why did you show me that?!”</p><br><p>“Hahaha! Come on, Adam! You’ve encountered hundreds or even more monsters on your path. Are you really saying this is the worst thing you’ve ever seen?”</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand as if trying to forget what he had seen, although that was hardly possible.</p><br><p>“That’s not the point! I mean, why does this even exist? Sure, I’ve seen uglier monsters, but how could this even appear, and why here? It’s a mistake, for sure!”</p><br><p>Silvana shrugged with a mocking smile.</p><br><p>“Well, you can say what you want, but you have to be prepared for Nollura to look exactly like that. Although… Maybe she’s much scarier.”</p><br><p>“Agh?” Adam frowned. “I don’t understand what you’re so happy about. Even if she’s an ugly woman, she’s still a woman. Hah, aren’t you afraid of competition?”</p><br><p>“Pffffft!” Silvana snorted. “I can’t believe you said that. I’m definitely not the jealous type, and if I didn’t feel anything for Gareyna, then I definitely don’t need to worry about some mutant spider woman.”</p><br><p>Click. Click. Click.</p><br><p>Adam was about to respond when he heard clicking sounds coming from off to the side.</p><br><p>His smile widened and his eyes lit up when he saw several silhouettes with long legs approaching him.</p><br><p>“Just what I need! Never thought I’d be so happy to see monsters!” Adam exclaimed as several dark spiders surrounded him.</p><br><p>Their bodies were black, covered with a hard, granite-like layer for protection with jagged edges. They almost blended into the darkness if not for their four green eyes and bright, emerald tips on their legs.</p><br><p>“Come on, attack!” Adam waved his hand, summoning his needle.</p><br><p>As if responding to his call, the black spiders trembled and spat clumps of web at him.</p><br><p>Adam’s frame shook as he dodged at the last moment and appeared next to one of the spiders.</p><br><p>“First!” Adam waved his hand, intending to cut the spider, but the others saved their fellow monster by pulling it aside with their threads.</p><br><p>This did not upset Adam.</p><br><p>On the contrary, it only made his heart beat faster.</p><br><p>“Come on, attack! I’m ready! As soon as I deal with you, I’ll find your ugly queen!”</p><br><br><p>The black spiders looked at each other and, using all their many legs, ran away, moving in one direction.</p><br><br><p>Adam blinked several times in confusion as his expression changed abruptly from excited to annoyed.</p><br><p>“Stop! We’ve only just begun! Why the hell are you running away!”</p><br><p>Naturally, Adam had no intention of standing there and watching the black spiders run away.</p><br><p>He needed to fight someone, and that desire grew stronger with every passing minute. In the dark forest, he couldn’t give his all against the Red Bloom, and the same was true for Targon and Gareyna.</p><br><p>Sometimes he just helped, sometimes he went through trials that couldn’t be called real combat, and sometimes he was a conversation partner for those who wanted to learn more about the new territory.</p><br><p>There was nothing wrong with that, but it couldn’t quench Adam’s thirst for battle. He needed to warm up before the fight with Ureyn, and any means were good for that, be it Nollura or simple spiders.</p><br><br><p>Adam lunged forward, leaving a small crater behind him, running after the black spiders at full speed.</p><br><p>With each leap, cracks remained on the ground, and if a web got in his way, he cut it in time with his needle. It was no problem for him.</p><br><p>Silvana’s eyes darted from side to side, analyzing Adam’s movements.</p><br><p>“Adam… These spiders, they’re not just running away, they’re…”</p><br><p>But before she could finish, Adam jumped off the edge, landing in the center of a spacious hall.</p><br><p>Only then did the black spiders stop sticking together and scatter in all directions so that Adam couldn’t decide which one to follow.</p><br><p>His attention was drawn to something else — the green lights from the great pillars filling the underground hall, like an ancient temple. Everything around was covered with cobwebs, but not because the place was abandoned, but to make it easier for the spiders to move around this land.</p><br><br><p>In the center flowed a river above which rose a round altar, gathering energy from the earth and river into a dense orb hovering above the stone platform.</p><br><p>However, none of the spiders rushed to approach the altar, as only one monster had the right to do so.</p><br><br><p>Footsteps sounded as a tall figure appeared from behind a pillar, strangely moving on two legs, just like a human.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened as he watched the attractive woman with sharp features, large green eyes, and platinum hair cascading down her shoulders.</p><br><p>Tight-fitting black armor covered her body, leaving more than half of it exposed, as if to deliberately emphasize the curves she could boast of.</p><br><p>The final detail was eight black blades with emerald tips growing straight out of her back. She could move them freely, like a spider moves its legs.</p><br><p>Then, she turned around and licked her lips with her long tongue.</p><br><p>“Oh, what a handsome come to me.”</p><br><p>Nollura purred, leaving Adam speechless.</p>
