            <br><p>A shadow fell over Adam, leaving visible only his lone eye and the brightly burning crimson flame from his armor.</p><br><p>The sword shuddered, losing contact with the chain and Adam, the energy quickly drained away destining the ghastly sword to become nothing more than a multitude of dark red clots.</p><br><p>Nothing more was cutting Nirosh's leg, the bright, almost unbearable pain was gone, but... it wasn't a good sign for him.</p><br><br><p>Fingertips covered in multiple layers of armor from a heavy crimson gauntlet dug into Nirosh's flesh on his chest.</p><br><p>They possessed no sharpness, just brute force - it was enough to tear Nirosh's skin, sink deep, and break his bones.</p><br><p>As a last hope, Nirosh reached his hand forward, trying to do something, but it was too late.</p><br><p>If he wanted to stay alive, he had to be stronger - everyone at the Moon Colosseum understood that even a child saw a bloody battle for the first time.</p><br><p>It was the truth - simple and obvious.</p><br><br><p>Nirosh's mouth opened wide when he felt something squeeze his heart, rough and hard, but not strong enough to explode it.</p><br><p>Slowly, the crimson gauntlet covering Adam's right arm dissipated, top to bottom, as did his cape with his helmet. His energy reached its limit, he'd done more than he should have, but... there was still some unfinished work.</p><br><p>"Nirosh, I guess... you won't be needing this anymore either."</p><br><p>Crimson particles flew in front of Adam's face, his voice quiet and cold as with a judge passing a deadly verdict.</p><br><p>"After all, your heart rotted long ago, what good is it?"</p><br><p>Under his serene gaze, Adam pulled Nirosh's heart from his chest, causing him to take one of his last breaths. Stay connected with My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><br><p>With a twitch of his hand, Adam tossed Nirosh's heart aside like useless trash of no value, physical or mental.</p><br><p>Turning his head to the side, wide-eyed Nirosh crawled forward, his nails sinking into the ground, trying to reach his most valuable treasure.</p><br><p>"Gha... I'll get you back..."</p><br><p>A heavy, intermittent wheeze emerged from the depths of Nirosh's throat as he approached his heart, a long, wide bloody trail left on the ground behind.</p><br><br><p>His hand, just the tips of his fingers, touched the still-beating heart. A faint, happy smile spread across his face, a hope rose in his gaze.</p><br><p>Then, his eye went blank and Nirosh let out his last breath.</p><br><p>Adam watched his victim's unsuccessful attempts to return to the world of the living, knowing that it was already over.</p><br><p>"How pathetic... It's nothing more than a shame... Although, what else does a man like him deserve?"</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam looked around, gazing at the ruined arena, remembering what he had done not just today, but over the past year when his life had drastically changed.</p><br><p>"Well, I'm not a good person..." Adam whispered, glancing at Nelya for some reason, "I'm not strong enough to forgive bastards..."</p><br><br><p>The morning wind currents, simultaneously warm and cold, swept by Adam's side, fluttering his hair and the edges of his long coat.</p><br><p>The spectators in his sight became nothing more than hundreds of blurry silhouettes, indistinguishable from one another.</p><br><p>Then, his gaze stopped on Silvana, seeing her slight smile and confident expression: no matter what he did or what decision he made, she would always support him.</p><br><br><p>With a thud, Adam fell to the ground, a wave of dust rising high up, covering him like a delicate veil, wanting to remember this fighter.</p><br><br><p>Silence fell for a long time, no one dared to say anything or jump to conclusions because no one understood what the result was.</p><br><p>Nirosh who should not have fought was dead, while the two fighters were unconscious. Their breathing was slow and heavy, their bodies were on edge and their hearts were struggling to do their job, but... they were alive.</p><br><p>As was well known, there could be no draw in The Rule of Power, or else the whole point would be lost - the conflict would remain unresolved, which would lead to the inevitable repetition of history.</p><br><p>Gradually, all eyes shifted from the fighters to Kogen.</p><br><p>If anyone could be the judge, it was him, head of the Noukx Family and ruler of the ninth wing.</p><br><p>No one would question his decision, so it was up to him.</p><br><p>"Damn, everything was going so well until now. Couldn't you just kill each other, or at least stay awake?" Kogen raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>If Adam hadn't passed out, no one would have doubts about the winner, but now... things weren't that obvious.</p><br><p>"Agh... Well, we'll see what we can do."</p><br><p>Shaking his head under his frustrated voice, Kogen slowly rose from his throne, he walked to the edge gazing intently at the arena - preparing to make a decision.</p><br><p>Before he could say anything, a slight smirk appeared on his face as he retreated into the shadows.</p><br><p>Bewilderment fell over the audience, whispers began in all parts of the arena, but soon everything became clear.</p><br><br><p>Clutching the ground beneath his fingers, Fromund slowly opened his eyes. Instinctively, he carefully stood up feeling a deafening pain all over his body, his wounds hadn't gone anywhere, but his condition was stable allowing him to regain some strength.</p><br><p>He was as stunned as the audience, not because of his awakening but from the scene before him - a dead Nirosh holding his own heart and lying on the ground Adam.</p><br><p>'Wait... Is he dead?'</p><br><p>That was the first thing Fromund thought, but as soon as he saw Adam's chest rise slightly at the sigh, the corners of his lips went up.</p><br><p>"I see... Well, looks like it's all over, doesn't it?" Fromund muttered approaching one of the rocks, the debris of his meteorites.</p><br><p>By the silence and the stares full of anxiety and concern, Fromund realized that the results of their duel hadn't been announced yet.</p><br><p>Not wanting to make a mistake, Fromund cast a quick glance at Kogen, in return receiving a deep nod.</p><br><p>"Hah, fuck... I don't want to do this so badly..."</p><br><p>Fromund smiled bitterly, dipping his fingers into his messy, blood-slicked crimson hair.</p><br><p>Then, he raised his head looking at the most important people to him - Elva, Tilda, and Liv, their tear-reddened eyes made his heart clench painfully, but he also felt a pleasant warmth.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry, I lost in such an important fight, this... this is a failure."</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, struggling with his dark desires, Fromund stated:</p><br>
