            <br><p>"The Rule of Power...? What does that mean?" Adam asked, he was confused since he never heard of something like that before. It sounded like a tradition or unusual law, which wasn't far from the truth.</p><br><p>Osana smirked insidiously. Of all the things she had said, that was what caught Adam's attention, it couldn't help but please her.</p><br><p>"Adam, nobles, society, economy, military, politics, and so on, the dozens of factors that make up our lives, it's all very important, but... it just pales before one simple thing: power."</p><br><br><p>"I'm not sure, but it's possible that if our world didn't have monsters, the Dead Lands, or the Phantoms, then power would be something secondary. But... in our world, it's obvious. To some it's unfair, and to others, it's a handy tool you can use to solve any issue."</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head, curiosity was visible in his gaze. He didn't think he was the strongest, but he already knew the joy of battle and the taste of bloody fights. He saw what Damien was capable of even at K2-Level, it allowed him to glimpse the dazzling light shining at the very top, from which he was infinitely far away.</p><br><p>"Anyway, all nobles know about The Rule of Power, I can't claim for sure, but it's one of the most influential rules that you can't go against." Osana's corners of his mouth went upward.</p><br><br><p>"I see... Just like you can't refuse to marry Light Noble that is a Natural Phantom."</p><br><p>Osana sighed slightly before continuing:</p><br><p>"Yeah, you're right. Basically, with The Rule of Power, you can challenge the decision made by the great families about marriage. Although, this rule is actually rarely enforced."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, he didn't understand why such a convenient way to solve a problem was rarely resorted to.</p><br><br><p>Osana waved her hands apart showing the hopelessness of the situation.</p><br><p>"It's simple. If you're a Hallow Noble, you hardly have the strength to use The Rule of Power. If you're a Light Noble and you don't want to marry another Light Noble, then you need to find someone willing to stand up for you and use The Rule of Power."</p><br><br><p>"Other nobles from great families won't step in and use The Rule of Power. It's extremely rare and there must be a very solid reason for it." Osana said sternly.</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head.</p><br><p>"Wait... I understand why the nobles don't want to get involved, but what's stopping you from asking someone from the outside? I mean, the nobles have a lot of money, can't they pay some random Phantom to use The Rule of Power?"</p><br><p>Osana shook her head.</p><br><p>"You're thinking right, but few Phantoms are willing to ruin relations with even one great family, and when it comes to a wedding, there are two great families involved."</p><br><p>"But... That's not the biggest problem. Even if the other Phantoms don't mind standing up for you, you still need them to win. It's very difficult to find a Phantom who is strong and talented enough for this."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment.</p><br><p>"What, are all the nobles about to marry so strong that they can't be defeated by any Phantom?"</p><br><p>Osana smiled bitterly. She looked to the side and folded her arms.</p><br><p>"It's not that Nirosh Marzo is very strong or the other nobles, it's that when using The Rule of Power, the nobles can choose their fighter. It seems strange, but it's logical since Light Noble who used this rule won't fight himself either."</p><br><p>Adam's gaze became sharper, then an ironic smirk appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"I see. So, whether you're the Hallow Noble or the Light Noble, you need to find a Phantom who doesn't mind bringing down the wrath of two great families and is strong enough to win, and it doesn't have to be a noble."</p><br><br><p>"Yes, you got it right. If this Phantom wins, he has the right to demand anything he wants. Including taking possession of this Light Noble who was supposed to be married."</p><br><p>Then, Adam reached his hand forward, revealing the wedding ring on his finger.</p><br><p>"Hah, Osana, you sly fox, I wasn't wrong about you. Now I realize what you did."</p><br><p>Adam pointed at the ring, staring intently at Osana, a speck of threat and annoyance could be seen in his gaze.</p><br><p>"You used your two wishes on some bullshit to confuse me. Then, shocked me with your third wish, but..."</p><br><p>Adam's voice grew heavier.</p><br><p>"You want me to fight for you using The Rule of Power so you don't have to marry Nirosh Marzo, am I right?"</p><br><p>Osana nodded silently, confirming Adam's words. He didn't elaborate on a few more details, but in general, it was as he said.</p><br><p>Accepting her answer, Adam slowly stood up, walked around the table, and stopped in front of Osana, staring down at her intently, his menacing figure towering over her.</p><br><p>"But what makes you think I'll agree? Answer me, what's stopping me from just walking away now and not putting myself at risk? I'm sure I'll be in a lot of trouble if Marzo and Rouzet Families get mad at me. I'm not a nobleman with wealth and connections like you."</p><br><p>Osana's lips quivered. Her mouth opened hastily as she was about to say something, but she stopped herself in time.</p><br><p>Instead of saying that Adam owed her and it was just her third wish, she slowly tilted her head forward and closed her eyes.</p><br><p>"Please, you're the only one I can turn to and who I'm sure will win. I don't want to be someone's wife without rights but with luxuries. I don't want to live in a golden cage time after time giving birth to heirs while my husband has all the fun he wants because of his nature."</p><br><p>Osana clenched her fists tightly and gritted her teeth.</p><br><p>"Fuck, Adam, I'm the Phantom. I want to kill monsters and travel the Dead Lands, only growing stronger and more mature with each victory or defeat. I don't want to be a decoration for some Light Noble who is unlike me is a Natural Phantom."</p><br><p>Osana gulped as she looked at Adam, there was nothing but confidence in her gaze.</p><br><p>"Your help is tantamount to freedom for me. Please, for the sake of freedom, I'm willing to do anything. If you win, no one will argue The Rule of Power. If you want you can have the money, my services as Phantoms, or just me as a woman. All of which are far better than what awaits me."</p><br><p>She didn't have to wait long for Adam's reaction. In fact, he already made up his mind when he heard her first sentence, the rest he didn't even bother to listen to and just waited for her to finish talking.</p><br><p>Adam wanted to see if Osana would demand his help or ask for it. It was the only thing that mattered and he got his answer.</p><br><p>"Good." Adam shrugged nonchalantly and returned to his seat.</p><br><p>He crossed his arms over his chest and leaned back against the seat.</p><br><p>"I'll help you, but I'm afraid we're not going to make it."</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Osana blinked several times.</p><br><p>"I can't win. I'll lose."</p>
