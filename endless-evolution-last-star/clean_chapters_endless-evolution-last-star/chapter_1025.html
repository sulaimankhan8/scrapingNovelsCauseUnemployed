            <h4>Chapter 1025: Ruined Castle</h4><br><p>Adam or any other monster could absorb Arnoth and Lost Light’s energy. Even though Adam was human and couldn’t absorb energy from the environment, it was still possible to do so under some special circumstances.
</p><br><p>The golden orb wouldn’t help him immediately become a K4-Phantom, but the Evolution Tree might be able to devour it and become a bit stronger. Arnoth’s energy became dense, resembling an essence, moreover, the sphere also contained the energy of Lost Light, which was an External Artifact.
</p><br><p>But, it was to fulfill the last wish of not only Arnoth but also the Crimson Monarch.
</p><br><p>Moira opened her eyes, light falling on her shocked face.
</p><br><p>Baffled, she slowly turned around, facing Adam’s exhausted but kind gaze.
</p><br><p>"I promised Kyros that I would take care of you, just as I promised Arnoth that I would use his energy in the best possible way. Let’s go..." Adam muttered, looking at the growing darkness. "Take this energy and leave, it looks like you don’t have much time left."
</p><br><p>Moira glanced at Silvana, who gave her a gentle smile.
</p><br><p>"It’s alright. This is how it should have been originally... Who knows, maybe the Crimson Monarch initially relied on this outcome. He did the right thing by leaving your safety to Adam. But...
</p><br><p>"There always comes a time when you have to say farewell and go up against the world alone. It’s time to find your own way, Moira."
</p><br><p>From the beginning, their union was uneasy and forced. In the end, Moira wanted to always be with the Crimson Monarch, but in a battle against Adam, the Crimson Monarch died.
</p><br><p>Adam killed Kyros and there was no way Moira could ignore that. However, she had no desire or reason to take revenge on him, not after Kyros’s last wish.
</p><br><br><p>Moira gulped, her eyes wet. Before she realized it, tears were coming from her eyes.
</p><br><p>When she noticed it, she turned to the side and clenched her fists tightly in an attempt to control her emotions, but it was unsuccessful.
</p><br><p>"Thank you... I’m sure... If Kyros saw this, he would be as grateful to you as I am..."
</p><br><p>Without saying anything else, Moira pushed away from the air, about to touch the golden sphere.
</p><br><br><p>Adam’s voice made her turn around.
</p><br><p>"Y-Yes...?" she stammered.
</p><br><p>Adam smiled widely, pointing at her with his single hand.
</p><br><p>"I’m sure I’ll get to the Dark Shore sooner or later. That will be our meeting place. You must become strong to survive. So, make the most of this last gift from us all!"
</p><br><p>"Sure..." Moira nodded weakly. "I will never be weak again. I promise to you and Kyros."
</p><br><p>Then, Moira touched the golden orb.
</p><br><p>The thickening darkness absorbed the bright flash of light, hiding Moira and the last bits of Arnoth and Lost Light.
</p><br><p>All three of them disappeared right before Adam and Silvana’s eyes.
</p><br><p>"Agh..." Adam let out a sigh of relief.
</p><br><p>He felt a weight fall from his shoulders. Not only the victory over Arnoth and the fifth gate, but also Moira’s departure. She wasn’t supposed to stay in his inner space forever, only temporarily.
</p><br><p>"What should be done is done..." Adam muttered, falling to the ground.
</p><br><p>Silvana walked slowly around him, glancing around.
</p><br><p>Despite her new strength, she was shocked to see the aftermath of the battle between the two warriors. There was almost nothing left of the great castle, only the first floor kept its structure, but the columns and walls had turned into ruins.
</p><br><p>"Adam." Silvana leaned over, glaring up at him. "As much as I hate to leave, I can’t stay here any longer."
</p><br><p>A bitter smile covered Adam’s face. "It’s all about ability, right?"
</p><br><p>"Yeah." Silvana looked at her hand, it turned transparent and faded. "I’m wasting too much of our energy. You’re in no danger anymore, so try to rest. Don’t worry, I’ll keep in contact with you."
</p><br><p>"Hah, whatever you say."
</p><br><p>Then, Silvana closed her eyes as she ceased into clots of white energy. The energy swirled around Adam before quickly heading into his body in one powerful burst.
</p><br><p>Adam was left alone. He was badly injured and exhausted, but continued to breathe and remain conscious.
</p><br><p>"Fuck, that was harder than I expected, and..." Adam sighed heavily, looking at the shards from Arnoth’s armor. "He left no trophy for me. Moreover, his last wish forced me to lose the Crimson Monarch’s trophy! Hah, looks like bad days have begun for my collection."
</p><br><p>In the distance, Adam saw a multitude of figures approaching him.
</p><br><p>Up ahead were Grita and Torz, helping the injured Risha to walk. Vorx and Heret were still not awake.
</p><br><p>Well, they would be glad to see that their plan had worked and the resistance had won, despite what great destruction the castle had gone through.
</p><br><br><p>Silvana’s physical body was seriously injured and was already in the medical ward at the Red Tower. She didn’t know it, but she knew she would be taken care of there.
</p><br><br><p>Pensive, Silvana walked amidst the darkness, under the gaze of the Evolution Tree.
</p><br><p>[You did good, Silvana... You did a good job...]
</p><br><p>She turned around, looking at her Evolution Sprout, which already become a full part of the Evolution Tree, pumping energy through it like a great, complex vein - the most important one in the body.
</p><br><p>"Yes, it was complicated and unexpected, for both of us."
</p><br><p>[Hahaha... I’m sorry, even if I wanted to, I couldn’t tell you more... Anyway, you were willing to make any sacrifices for Adam, weren’t you?]
</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply, pressing her palm against her chest.
</p><br><p>"There’s no doubt about that. But that power... Just one cut was enough to defeat a powerful monster like Arnoth. He was a Hollow Wave monster, and not only that. Lost Light was his ally because he was a new type to us - the Crucible Type."
</p><br><p>For a while, the Evolution Tree said nothing, leaving Silvana alone with her thoughts.
</p><br><p>Then, with a shake of energy, a powerful voice rang out.
</p><br><p>[Silvana... Adam’s Initial Gene has a lot more room now... Moira is gone and Adam is stronger... So... Someone wants to talk to you.]
</p><br><p>A flaming star flew out from the tree.
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze appeared in front of Silvana, carrying a slight smile.</p>
