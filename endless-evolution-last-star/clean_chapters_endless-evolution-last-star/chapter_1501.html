            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1501: Detached Mountains (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Adam and Alexia were ready to rush back into battle, return to the Dead Lands, or more precisely, set off for a new region — the Primal Lands.</p><br><p>They knew that this would hardly be a fun trip. On the contrary, it would be something dangerous and important for each of them.</p><br><p>However, before heading to the Primal Lands, they needed a little preparation.</p><br><p>Alexia and Louis decided to end their honeymoon, and Adam took another week off.</p><br><p>During this time, they not only rested but also learned more about the Primal Lands.</p><br><p>The more information they received, the more they wanted to go to these lands.</p><br><p>The Tarnished Lands and Dark Shore were similar in some ways. There were many dangerous monsters, places, and Lords. The main difference was their location and how organized the Befallen Crown was, like an army, while the Renegades were somewhat carefree.</p><br><p>Unlike the Befallen Crown, who wanted to control every part of the Dark Shore and even the world, the Renegades simply made sure that nothing out of the ordinary happened on their territory.</p><br><p>Also, the Befallen Crown had another problem, or even two: neutral Lords, such as Saegar, who possessed great power, and the Free End.</p><br><p>Of all the strongest factions in this world, the Free End was the smallest, but at the same time, no one dared to underestimate them. The will of each member and their power was enough of a threat on its own.</p><br><p>But the Primal Lands were not like that. There was no powerful faction there, at least not that Adam and Alexia had heard of.</p><br><p>There were only two threats in the Primal Lands: monsters and energy.</p><br><p>It seemed that one could say that about every territory, even the Dead Lands around the Citadel, but the Primal Lands had these two threats in their purest form.</p><br><p>Nowhere else was the energy as turbulent as it was there, and soon Adam and Alexia would experience it for themselves.</p><br><br><br><p>Adam put down his coffee cup as he glanced at Silvana, who was sitting across from him with a tablet in her hands.</p><br><p>Exactly one week had passed since their visit to Heaven Island.</p><br><p>Today was the day they had agreed to meet with Alexia, Louis, Damien, and Beth.</p><br><p>Damien and Beth were supposed to help them get to the Primal Lands.</p><br><p>“Today is the day, right?” Adam asked with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>Unlike him, Silvana had a much more serious expression. She believed that going to the new lands was a dangerous and important event.</p><br><p>“You should stop being so carefree, Adam.”</p><br><p>“Why? I’ve already been to the Tarnished Lands and the Dark Shore. Obviously, the Primal Lands are a harsh place, but do I have a choice? I’ll go there to fight and win, as always. I’m ready for it!”</p><br><p>Silvana sighed deeply. She knew he would respond this way, and that was the problem.</p><br><p>“Yeah? Do you think everything went so well? Maybe I should remind you what happened in both cases?”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam was confused.</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes.</p><br><p>“The first time you ended up at the Dark Shore, it was by accident. If it weren’t for two powerful Lords, luck, and Wilfred’s intervention, you would have been dead long ago. The Befallen Crown was willing to sacrifice a dozen Lords to destroy you and your potential once and for all.”</p><br><p>Without pause, she continued:</p><br><p>“At the Tarnished Lands, things weren’t so bad. Still, if it weren’t for Frida’s help, an External Artifact would have killed you. Although it may have even been an Ancient One, I’m not sure. In any case, your first visit to these lands ended with you nearly dying.”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam just shrugged.</p><br><p>“I didn’t want to go to the Dark Shore so early. The First Star forced me to do it. The Tarnished Lands… Well, now I’ve returned without any problems, even though I was being hunted by several powerful monsters. Last time, I just didn’t know that I would get so much attention because I opened the Path Construct.”</p><br><p>Before Silvana could respond, Adam was in front of her as their eyes met.</p><br><p>“Come on, Silvana, you’ve started to feel it too, haven’t you? The desire to fight someone strong, a wild beast, not an arrogant elder. If you had the opportunity to participate in this directly, you would have the same opinion as me!”</p><br><p>She wanted to say that he was wrong and that it was foolish, but she couldn’t.</p><br><p>“Tsk, whatever!” She shook her head. “You need to get the Blood of God, and you’re thinking about how you’re going to enjoy the battle? You should be thinking about your goal!”</p><br><p>“Well, if I really have to fight a god someday, enjoying this unique event is the least I can do, isn’t it?”</p><br><p>Silvana had nothing to say when Adam turned around and headed for the refrigerator. He took out a carton of milk, intending to make himself another cup of coffee, the last one before his vacation at the Citadel ended.</p><br><br><p>Adam spent a lot of time with his family and bought a house for himself and Silvana. Well, the two of them also spent time together. After all, when they were alone, they remembered that they were not only a Phantom and Operator but a couple.</p><br><p>Still, they both agreed that it was time to get back to work.</p><br><p>There were still more than six years until the next World Wipe, but no one knew how long it would take Adam to become as strong as the Second Rank Phantoms of the Citadel.</p><br><p>“Hey, where does Damien want to meet us?” Adam asked, thinking he would have to go to one of the spires again.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Silvana had a different answer.</p><br><p>“To the mountains in the north. It’s a small area within the Pacific Lands.”</p><br><p>Adam blinked several times, puzzled.</p><br><p>“The mountains in the north? W-What? Why would I leave Citadel?”</p><br><p>Silvana’s eyes deepened.</p><br><p>“It’s the only way you’ll get to where you need to go quickly. That’s what they said.”</p>
