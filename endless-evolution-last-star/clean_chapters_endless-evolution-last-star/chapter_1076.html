            <br><p>Chapter 1076: The First Ones of Many? (Part 2)<br>
Hundreds of monsters of the Soaring Chain Island were hiding on the borders, hoping to survive the storm brought by the Three Lords. Dozens of monsters and one young Phantom were trying to reach the Twilight Crystal, hiding deep underground.</p><br><p>The owner of these beautiful lands, with eyes as bright as the wise sun, fought against the three arrogant Earls, intent on protecting both his people and his status.</p><br><p>Another Phantom was trying to get to the scene of the events to take part in it and become a major star.</p><br><p>But, amidst the growing chaos, there was one man who took the position of a mere spectator.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The bottles on the table shook, but not the glass in Kenward’s strong hand. The bright rays of the sun, full of warmth, did not prevent him from sitting in his hat and scarf, as a long black coat covered his body.</p><br><p>“Hmm… Only three Earls against Saegar? I didn’t just find that odd…” Kenward muttered as he narrowed his eyes, staring ahead. “They were just the only ones ready at that moment, that’s not the entire force that the Befallen Crown is willing to dedicate to finish off the Saegar.”</p><br><p>Even for Kenward to see anything yet was impossible. It was too early, but he could feel faint auras appearing in the distance.</p><br><p>‘Agh… So they’re trying to hold Saegar back? So that he doesn’t have time to come up with a plan and seek help from others like him?’</p><br><p>There weren’t very many strong Lords, independent ones like Saegar, but there were enough of them that if united, they would become a powerful force capable of resisting the Befallen Crown or the Free End.</p><br><p>Well, gathering all the monsters from the Free End would be an impossible task.</p><br><p>“Hmm.” Kenward hummed, raising his gaze towards the two figures hovering above the clouds. “Looks like Saegar was right… He does it too often. Sooner or later I’ll have to help him, for my own sake…”</p><br><p>Kenward wasn’t worried about his safety, but for his lands and especially for the dew trees. He had a good relationship with Saegar, though he was slow to admit it.</p><br><p>But if Saegar lost and his lands were taken over by the Befallen Crown or the Soaring Chain Islands were passed into the Sacrificial Waterfalls domain, Kenward could be in trouble.</p><br><p>Sooner or later, he could be the next target.</p><br><p>After a few moments, Kenward took a deep sip while closing his eyes.</p><br><p>“Anyway… Right now, I can still enjoy the show from a better place. Sometimes, it’s good to watch, isn’t it?”</p><br><p>Serra’s eyes flashed as her circle appeared in front of her. It still wasn’t as intimidating as Gladius’s, but the difference with Kenex’s was obvious. It was further proof that of the three Earls, she was the strongest.</p><br><p>“You left me no other choice…” Serra muttered, her voice quivering. “I will bring you down to the ground. You’re not the only one allowed to fly!”</p><br><p>Saegar lifted his chin, arrogance filling his eyes.</p><br><p>“Oh, really, I feel like I’m the decision-maker in my land.”</p><br><br><p>Serra chose her star when a golden sphere departed from her, covering the area around her field. This mechanism worked for monsters like her and Kenex as well as for a powerful Phantom like Gladius.</p><br><p>But everyone’s power and abilities were different.</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, Serra’s wingtips trembled as waves of golden energy surrounded her.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, multiple spots of light covered the sky above Saegar and Serra. The tips of countless spears that awaited only one thing – Serra’s order – appeared.</p><br><p>With a wave of her hand, the spears rained down on Saegar, so tightly packed together that a mesh of dense energy, like burning plasma, formed between them.</p><br><p>Saegar didn’t have the option of simply dodging, he had to either destroy the spears or defend himself.</p><br><p>Then, Saegar’s lips curved upward in a knowing smirk.</p><br><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>A hail of spears rained down upon the ground, cleaving both sky and clouds in its path. At Serra’s next flap of wings, Saegar found himself on the ground, surrounded by spears buried to the hilt in the soil.</p><br><p>But Serra wasn’t going to stop there. Her wings and her Arc were capable of more than just flight.</p><br><p>“I… I can do this. The main thing is to wound him, then Horon will help me.”</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The blades of her wings shuddered, filling with the might of light. Serra’s wings pointed forward, aiming at Saegar like a deadly rifle, but Serra didn’t have a projectile, she was one herself.</p><br><br><p>Practically catching up to the spears, Serra launched herself at Saegar, an amber line of ripped space left behind, following her supersonic speed.</p><br><p>All the monsters watching the fight from afar saw was Serra disappear and a second later show up right in front of Saegar carrying with her a crushing force of light.</p><br><p>But… Down below, she saw not an injured and weakened Lord. No, Saegar was ready, he was waiting for her, and his patience was coming to an end.</p><br><br><p>At the moment of impact, Saegar’s hand clenched tightly around Serra’s throat as all the light burst from her wings.</p><br><p>“I… I’ll burn you!” She roared through the pain.</p><br><p>Once her light reached Saegar, his energy turned into chaotic electrical discharges, darker than night – perfect guardians against the bright, unpleasant light.</p><br><p>“W-Wha…?!” Serra wheezed.</p><br><p>Her eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><br><p>Saegar muttered, while his lightning bolts tore Serra’s light apart like wild hounds breaking out of hell.</p><br><p>“I have realized what I want to do. I will deprive you of all your Arcs, and only then will I kill you.”</p><br><br><p>Saegar jumped, destroying with his leap the spears around him.</p><br><p>Before Serra realized it, her back crashed into the base of one of the islands. In the next breath, they flew upwards, and Saegar threw her to the ground like garbage.</p><br><p>Then, he grasped her wings with both hands that were connected to her body.</p><br><p>“I’m afraid this is going to be especially painful for you.”</p><br><p>Saegar’s voice boomed from above.</p><br><p>Soon, Serra’s face turned white, and everyone heard the great Lord’s frighteningly painful scream.</p>
