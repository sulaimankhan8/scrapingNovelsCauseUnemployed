            <br><p>Monsters and humans were very different, but they too were capable of feeling emotions, from joy and anger to pleasure and hatred.</p><br><p>Obviously, after what Abel did, the Obsidian Spiders wouldn't be able to quell their wrath until they destroyed every bit of him, and he understood that perfectly well.</p><br><br><p>Abel, covered in blood from the blood vessels and in the white fluid seeping out of the eggs, stopped abruptly with his broad back against the wall.</p><br><br><p>A loud hissing sounded from all directions as a multitude of long legs descended upon Abel. The Obsidian Spiders attacked him with everything they had, using their long legs and powerful jaws, but breaking through his defenses was not easy at all.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Every second, dozens of pulses were passing through Abel's body - the recoil from the monsters' attacks, the pressure was rapidly building up, but for now, Abel was fine.</p><br><p>"Hah, you're hitting weakly! You can't even scratch my shield let alone break through my protection!" Abel exclaimed with an excited expression.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a green blob of corrosive poison flew into his golden shield, flying over the spiders' backs.</p><br><p>Abel's pupils narrowed as he raised his shield sharply, successfully blocking the poison shot, but that was only the beginning.</p><br><p>Now, he had to block not only the spiders' strikes but also the hail of venomous clots.</p><br><p>The Obsidian Spiders realized that despite their best efforts, they couldn't get through Abel's defenses, so they became faster and faster, condensing into a smaller area.</p><br><p>At one point, a trickle of blood trickled from the corner of Abel's mouth, the negative effects of the powerful pulses running through his body getting stronger and stronger.</p><br><p>And when all the Obsidian Spiders gathered in front of Abel, some starting to climb the walls to get close to him from above, the moment his allies were waiting for arrived.</p><br><br><p>Talna nodded, realizing that time was short.</p><br><p>"Now, it's time for me to get involved."</p><br><br><p>With a wide sweep, Talna clutched her silver cross tightly, the spike-like sharp sides sinking into her pale skin, causing trickles of blood to carry pain over her face.</p><br><p>"Well, sometimes your Nexus can be very capricious. It always wants my blood to start working. Why did this even happen in the first place?" Talna smiled crookedly as her eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The chains of the cross trembled, filling with red energy. Then, Talna waved her hand, staring intently first at Silvana, then at Abel in the distance.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the red energy surged forward, splitting into two clots, carrying with it a single drop of Talna's brightly colored blood.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went upward, watching the red clot hovering for days. Soon, the clot shuddered vigorously, taking the form of a bloody halo that soared a few centimeters above her head.</p><br><p>From time to time, drops of blood dripped from the halo, before they could reach Silvana's skin, the drops evaporated, turning into crimson energy that saturated her body.</p><br><p>The same thing happened to Abel.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Abel gasped.</p><br><p>His eyes went wide at the wave of lightness that came over his body. The recoil was no longer painful, his internal wounds that made him bleed were gone, moreover, his muscles got a little bigger and stronger, and his vision sharper.</p><br><p>Silvana glared at Talna, sensing how much more powerful she had become since the arrival of the bloody halo.</p><br><p>Talna smirked smugly, appearing pleased even though her gaze was now tired, this ability took a lot of energy from her.</p><br><p>"Yeah, there's no secret, you're now even deadlier than before, and under my amplification, Abel will be able to withstand many more attacks."</p><br><p>Feeling her body become lighter, Silvana nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Good, but it's time to rescue our protector, otherwise we can't go any further without him."</p><br><br><p>Silvana stepped forward as her eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the black mist appeared again, however, this time it did not leave her body, a sharp rush was unnecessary for her right now. The mist traveled down her arms, along her blades, emanating from the blades like flames.</p><br><p>She didn't get any extra speed, and her scissors didn't get any longer, but now only a very strong defense could stop her blades, which Obsidian Spiders didn't possess.</p><br><br><p>Silvana appeared behind the spider, its first victim who was still furiously attacking Abel, in its bright as the sun shield.</p><br><p>The monsters didn't know that what they should fear was not the light, but the darkness coming for them.</p><br><p>"Gha..." Discover hidden tales at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>With a cold breath, Silvana swung her blades, slicing the first spider into four pieces.</p><br><p>Before the other Obsidian Spiders could notice anything, she had killed four more. However, due to Abel's ability, most of the spiders were focused only on him.</p><br><p>Earlier, Abel had been focused on the spiders' attacks, now he relaxed, watching how the massive menacing monsters turned into nothing more than bloody scraps of filthy flesh in the distance.</p><br><p>"Good, now all that's left is to get to the lowest point." Abel nodded slightly, a bitter smile on his face.</p><br><br><p>After a few minutes of true carnage from one performer, there was not a single Obsidian Spider left alive.</p><br><p>Silvana stood in the center of the cave, breathing heavily.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."</p><br><p>Her entire body was covered in dark insect blood, jets of hot steam escaping upwards and crimson droplets flowed down her black blades in a rapid stream, forming puddles on the ground.</p><br><p>Abel went back for his hammer, and Talna walked on, looking at the wide hole below.</p><br><p>"Damn..." Talna scratched the back of her head, "There's a lot of protruding rocks, but... how long will it take us to get back down."</p><br><p>Silvana appeared behind her, still holding her blood-covered scissors threateningly.</p><br><p>Talna puffed up her cheeks.</p><br><p>"Hey, if you do that you'll scare people."</p><br><p>"Let's move on." Silvana said impatiently.</p><br><br><p>Talna waved her hand with half-closed eyes.</p><br><p>"Wait, we have nowhere to rush, give yourself and Abel a few minutes to catch your breath. No one knows what's in store for us next, and you need to think about how to climb down so you don't scratch your hilts and buns!"</p><br><p>Another joke didn't get the desired reaction as Silvana was getting too stressed out for some reason.</p><br><br><p>Before Talna could say anything, Silvana connected her blades into scissors and grabbed her face with her free hand before jumping down.</p><br><p>She wanted to finish this mission as quickly as possible to get rid of the anxiety inside, burning like wildfire.</p><br><br><p>The only thing Abel heard was Talna's mumble, who was clearly against such treatment.</p><br><br><p>Abel shook his head, resting the hammer on his shoulder.</p><br><p>"Women are so fickle... One moment they're fun to be with, and the next moment they danger."</p><br><p>He was left with no other choice, so with a shrug Abel jumped down straight to the lowest level.</p>
