            <br><p>The last thing Katrin saw was a bright flash that blinded her briefly. Then, still struggling against the light, she felt a threatening presence behind her, as if death itself came for her.
</p><br><p>Throwing a glance over her shoulder, Katrin’s black eyes went wide, reflecting fear mixed with surprise.
</p><br><p>The snow-white blade, a dense energy ran through the Dormant Lord’s raised high-up arm, transforming his palm into a long, deadly blade.
</p><br><p>In less than a split second, Katrin’s mind was filled with fragments of the Flame Raider’s death, the cause of such a powerful monster’s demise was an identical attack.
</p><br><p>Katrin also remembered everything she knew about the Dormant Lord. Unlike Adam, who went on the mission following Silvana’s instructions, Katrin did not spare herself and thoroughly prepared for each mission together with Alan, studying the monsters and conditions of the territories, especially such strong enemies as the Dormant Lord.
</p><br><p>Then, a single thought appeared in her mind, a single word describing both the situation and her emotions:
</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Katrin held out her sword in front of her for protection, and her coat, thickened its fabric around her right arm, strengthening her grip as much as possible.
</p><br><br><p>The light blade collided with the black sword, Katrin’s feet sinking into the sand to ankle level, her face contorted from the intense pressure.
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord, for his part, remained unfazed. He could see how hard Katrin was taking their clash, and... it caused nothing but disappointment inside him.
</p><br><p>Cutting through the wind currents, The Dormant Lord’s left fist plunged into Katrin’s stomach.
</p><br><br><p>Katrin gasped as her eyes went wide from the bright sudden pain. Trailing off, the Dormant Lord raised his right palm, about to cut Katrin in two.
</p><br><p>Even though the Dormant Lord acted without delay and Katrin was in shock, she managed to pull herself together.
</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, Katrin bounced to the side, the light blade passing close to her shoulder but failing to hit her.
</p><br><p>The corners of her lips turned upward as a satisfied glint appeared in her eyes. Maybe she wasn’t winning yet, but this was just the beginning of the fight and she could still show what she was capable of.
</p><br><p>Heavy and hard as steel feet crashed straight into Katrin’s face from the left side in a white flash. Her skin stretched from the powerful hit, while her pupils flickered running from side to side.
</p><br><p>The black sword fell from the tight grip, cleaving the sand with its sharp blade.
</p><br><p>Katrin’s body flew dozens of meters away, devoid of her control, not even her fingertips moving.
</p><br><br><p>With a thud, Katrin crashed into the nearest hill, sand sprinkled over her shoulders, almost completely covering her legs, but her head remained on the surface.
</p><br><p>’Katrin!’ Alan exclaimed hoping she would wake up, but....
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord was already in front of her, as was his fist.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The dark coat shuddered, turning into a thick black mass in front of Katrin’s face. The dark mass engulfed the Dormant Lord’s fist, stopping it a few centimeters from Katrin’s face.
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord lifted his chin slightly with curiosity watching the unusual coat that was actually one of Katrin’s abilities, a unique one.
</p><br><p>Suddenly, Katrin’s eyes opened, black and calm, full of desire to defeat the strongest creature in this spacious territory.

</p><br><p>Her hand gripped the Dormant Lord’s wrist firmly, with enough force that the crystal grid covering his gray skin curved.
</p><br><p>"That was fucking painful motherfucker... But, that was your fatal mistake!"
</p><br><p>Before the Dormant Lord had time to realize it, Katrin’s palm was already on his chest, pressing down tightly.
</p><br><p>Black energy ran swiftly down her left arm, lashing out in a plague clot, the one that nearly killed the Blinding Sylphyre.
</p><br><p>With a shiver running through his body, the Dormant Lord bounced back, staring intently at the black blob spreading rapidly across his chest.
</p><br><p>At that moment, some of the Phantoms watching the battle had satisfied smiles on their faces. They saw what Katrin’s abilities were capable of, how dangerous the plague was, yet... Viron and Gnash were in no hurry to jump to conclusions.
</p><br><p>They were stronger than most, so... they realized how dangerous and difficult an opponent the Dormant Lord was.
</p><br><p>The crystal grid trembled, trying to withstand the onslaught of the plague, but the corrosive power of darkness was unstoppable, it would continue to destroy everything in its path until there was nothing left of the Dormant Lord.
</p><br><p>Without hesitation, the Dormant Lord thrust his hand into the black clot, his fingers sinking into the viscous corrosive mass, without fear that the plague would spread along his hand and quickly reach his head.
</p><br><p>Several Phantoms watching from the sidelines got confused expressions:
</p><br><p>"What the hell...? What’s he going to do?"
</p><br><p>"There’s no way he can get rid of the plague, right? R-Right?"
</p><br><p>The next moment, a bright flash fell on their faces, making them squint their eyes unable to look anymore.
</p><br><p>A blinding, scorching light ran down the Dormant Lord’s arm, accumulating under his palm, all of his power in one small area.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The black clot trembled, trying to escape, but the pressure was too strong, locking the black clot in a prison of nothing but cruel light.
</p><br><p>Soon, jets of smoke came out from beneath the Dormant Lord’s fingers, while the black clot became smaller and smaller until it disappeared completely, turning into a few tiny embers lost in the cold sand.
</p><br><p>Ignoring the remnants of the plague clot, the Dormant Lord looked up the hill but saw only an empty pit.
</p><br><br><p>A confident voice came from outside, the Dormant Lord followed it, meeting Katrin’s confident gaze, the sword was back in her hand and her aura was quickly growing stronger.
</p><br><p>"No wonder you could handle one clot, but... let’s see what you can do against this one?"
</p><br><p>Then, her black eyes turned into whirlwinds, she activated her Second Order and her coat actively trembled descending towards the ground with its long edges.</p>
