            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1510: Frozen Spine (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>As Damien had said, the Primal Lands were a wild territory.</p><br><p>Dozens of monsters surrounded Adam and Alexia just moments after they landed, not to mention the ice wyvern.</p><br><p>Sure, only two of them were going to attack them. The white beasts moved forward slowly, each having already chosen its opponent.</p><br><p>But Adam couldn’t help but notice one thing.</p><br><p>‘None of them are in human form. Do they even have that ability in the first place?’ Adam thought, staring intently at the beast on the left.</p><br><p>If they had been this deep in the Tarnished Lands, let alone the Dark Shore, they would have definitely encountered several Elder Level monsters that were in their human forms. That was the norm in those territories, but here the situation was different.</p><br><p>“Hey, everyone takes one, right?” Alexia waved her hand.</p><br><br><p>“Exactly. I don’t know if they want to kill us or just test our strength, so we’ll play it by ear.”</p><br><p>Unlike Adam, who decided not to rush and wait for the first beast to approach him, Alexia grinned widely and lunged forward.</p><br><p>Both beasts looked at her, but only one of them stopped, while the second continued to move toward Adam.</p><br><p>Alexia did not summon her Nexus or use any abilities.</p><br><p>If they were hunters, she wanted to find out how strong the monsters here were first.</p><br><p>Sure, their auras showed a lot, but a direct confrontation gave the most accurate results.</p><br><br><p>The second beast growled, charging at Alexia like a bull. Its powerful body was dozens of times larger than the small girl in front of it, and its two powerful tusks moved straight toward Alexia.</p><br><p>If an ordinary person had been in her place, they would not only have suffered serious injuries, but the pure force would have turned them into bloody shreds.</p><br><p>Well, luckily for Alexia, she was no ordinary human.</p><br><br><p>With a powerful step forward, Alexia grabbed the white beast by the tusks. The momentum dragged her back several meters, leaving lines from her feet in the deep snow.</p><br><p>But, gradually, she slowed down, as did the beast, which was unable to ram her.</p><br><p>“Hah…” Alexia exhaled hot air, looking into the beast’s blue eyes. “You thought you could defeat me with such a simple move? That’s not enough!”</p><br><p>The white beast just snorted. Maybe it wasn’t in human form and couldn’t speak, but a monster as strong as this one easily understood what Alexia was saying.</p><br><p>However, Alexia had just stopped the attack, she had to show something much more impressive in response.</p><br><p>“Alright, I didn’t want to do this right away, but I think I’ll have time to recover my energy.”</p><br><p>Adam and the first white beast watched the battle between their partners with curiosity. Sure, they were rivals, but that didn’t stop them from taking a short break to see what Alexia was capable of.</p><br><p>It had been a long time since Adam had seen Alexia in battle. He knew that her abilities were related to ice and cold and that, like him, she preferred to fight quickly and aggressively.</p><br><p>But, strange as it may sound, Alexia was even more wild and reckless than Adam. He acted on instinct, but he didn’t neglect his mind, which helped him find ways to win during combat.</p><br><p>Well, Alexia also acted on instinct, only instead of her mind, her emotions came second.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A powerful aura, like a blue flame, came out of Alexia as a bright light headed toward her hands and feet.</p><br><p>The next moment, the battle gauntlets and boots appeared in place of the light, made of iron, with a thin layer of ice covering the sharp edges, while pipes like those on a motorcycle ran along the boots and gauntlets.</p><br><p>The gauntlets and boots were heavy and menacing, protecting Alexia’s knees and elbows, but retaining her mobility.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, staring intently at the pipes: cold steam slowly escaped from them, the temperature low enough to turn even the snow below into ice crystals.</p><br><br><p>A shiver ran through the second beast. Its huge body and thick white fur could not completely protect it from Alexia’s cold.</p><br><p>“What? Is something wrong?” Alexia licked her lips. “I thought that for a beast as big as you, who lives in cold lands, even the most terrible cold must be like a warm breeze. It seems I was wrong!”</p><br><p>A surge of energy filled Alexia’s gauntlets and boots as blue lines ran through the pipes.</p><br><p>She clenched her jaw as her muscles tensed to the limit.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br><p>“Wait… She wants to—?”</p><br><br><p>Alexia stepped forward as she gripped the white beast’s tusks tighter, squeezing them with such force that they were ready to crack.</p><br><p>Every monster watching them from the sidelines couldn’t believe what they were seeing.</p><br><p>A small, almost fragile-looking girl lifted the white beast off the ground, and the monster couldn’t do anything about it. The beast wasn’t prepared for this in any scenario.</p><br><p>“RRROOOOO!!!” The beast roared, shaking its head from side to side, but Alexia remained steady.</p><br><p>Alexia looked up at the beast that now hung above the ground.</p><br><p>However, even that wasn’t enough for her.</p><br><p>She enjoyed her rest at the Citadel, but she missed the Dead Lands. She was going to use all her strength if necessary.</p><br><p>“Decided to go against me? Fine, I’m no longer interested in you!”</p><br><br><p>She stepped forward, turned her torso, and threw the multi-ton monster aside like a projectile.</p><br><p>The ravens flew off the branches a moment before the white beast crashed into the trees. Despite the size of the trees, the white beast knocked down several of them before reaching the ground, leaving a trail of broken branches.</p><br><br><p>Alexia dusted off her hands as she placed her hands on her hips with a satisfied smile.</p><br><p>“Alright! That was a great warm-up!”</p><br><p>Not only were the monsters surprised, but Adam was too. He was pleased to see that his ally possessed such strength.</p><br><p>That a Phantom who was once as weak as he was had achieved such heights.</p><br><p>“Well, now it’s my turn, right?”</p>
