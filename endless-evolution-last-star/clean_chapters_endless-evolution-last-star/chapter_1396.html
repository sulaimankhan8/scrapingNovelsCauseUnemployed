            <h4>Chapter 1396: Helasa</h4><br><p>Although it was Norax’s idea for Adam to go to Izardo to see his friend Helasa, he told him practically nothing about her. Adam had very little information about the owner of the Raven Beak, and only his imagination could paint a picture that might not be true.
</p><br><br><p>Now, Adam followed Reyla to the top of the Raven Beak as she carried two trays full of various cocktails. Some of them were similar to those Adam had seen in the bars in the Citadel, but others... truly frightened him.
</p><br><p>’What? Is she really going to drink that?’ He shuddered as he looked at the cocktail in the triangular glass. It was a red cocktail, rich and dark, almost like blood, with a torn-out eye floating inside it, or at least that’s what Adam thought, and it smelled like raspberries.
</p><br><p>It was a rather strange sight and a stark contrast. All Adam could hope for was that Helasa wouldn’t ask him to share the cocktail with her. He wasn’t sure he could survive that.
</p><br><p>Soon, they stopped in front of round wooden doors, which Reyla opened with a powerful kick.
</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, puzzled. Reyla was even stranger than the cocktails she was carrying.
</p><br><p>’Alright, seeing something new is even an advantage. Hah, Reyla, I wonder what a monster like her will do in battle.’
</p><br><p>They went inside. This chamber was located at the very top of the Raven Beak, set aside specifically for its owner, Helasa.
</p><br><p>A large bed, a mirror, and a massive wardrobe full of various items were the first things that caught the eye.
</p><br><p>Reyla walked forward and placed the trays on the table, then looked toward the balcony, which offered a view of the entire city.
</p><br><br><p>The figure hidden behind the glass door put the book aside and stood up.
</p><br><p>Soon, a tall, middle-aged woman entered the room. Her purple hair was tied back in a loose bun, and only a lush red robe covered her body. Her eyes were green, as deep as the bags under her eyes, whether from lack of sleep, fatigue, or excessive alcohol consumption.
</p><br><p>’Is this Helasa? Is it really her?’ Adam asked himself internally.
</p><br><p>The woman gave Adam an appraising look before nodding deeply.
</p><br><p>"Good. You were not mistaken, Reyla. He is indeed a handsome one."
</p><br><p>Then, Helasa pointed at Adam and said in a commanding tone:
</p><br><p>"You, I don’t like to waste time, so get undressed right now."
</p><br><br><p>Adam wanted to believe he had heard her wrong, but from Reyla’s excited look and Helasa’s stern expression, he knew that wasn’t the case.
</p><br><p>"Wait, wait, wait! I didn’t come here for that!" Adam took a step back, waving his arms.
</p><br><br><p>Helasa stepped forward and, in a heartbeat, was right in front of Adam. She tried to grab his chin, but to her surprise, he dodged and fell onto the soft sofa nearby.
</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Reyla touched her lips, puzzled. "Why is he running away? Doesn’t he want to fuck you? Oh! I get it, this is your game?"
</p><br><p>No matter what Reyla said, what mattered was how calm Helasa’s reaction was.
</p><br><p>"Hah, yeah." Helasa’s lips curved upward. "Looks like he’s the type who wants to have a little showdown. Well, I can’t say I’m against that, so—!"
</p><br><p>But Helasa stopped abruptly as she noticed something about Adam.
</p><br><br><p>Helasa shook her head and picked up two cocktails before drinking them with the same ease as a sip of water.
</p><br><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.
</p><br><p>She cracked her neck and knuckles as she slowly opened her eyes, which now possessed a previously lacking clarity.
</p><br><br><p>Helasa turned to Reyla.
</p><br><p>"Reyla, darling, close the doors and put up a barrier at the entrance. It seems we misunderstood our young guest."
</p><br><p>"Yes! Will do!" Reyla did as Helasa said as she opened a locker next to the wall, where, among five pink crystals, was one white orb.
</p><br><p>A brief contact of energy, like an electric discharge, was enough to make the crystals shine brightly, and an invisible barrier passed through the room.
</p><br><br><p>Helasa sat down in a soft chair opposite Adam and crossed her long legs.
</p><br><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam gave her a questioning look.
</p><br><p>"Release your aura, just a little. As you can see, I have a bad hangover today, although... to be honest, I have one every day, so I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly."
</p><br><p>Adam nodded and did as she said. The meeting did not start as he had expected, but this was his chance to get everything back on track.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>A white flame ran through Adam’s frame, just for a moment, as he quickly hid his aura.
</p><br><p>However, for Helasa and Reyla, that was more than enough.
</p><br><p>"Are you a Phantom? Apparently, this is your first time in Izardo, and you immediately decided to go to my tavern? Hah, was I lucky to meet you first, or did you come here on purpose?"
</p><br><p>"He’s a Phantom?!" Reyla exclaimed and jumped up and down with joy. "So that’s why his appearance seemed so unusual to me! Tsk! I was so stupid, I should have figured it out right away!"
</p><br><p>Helasa shrugged. "Well, he’s very good at hiding his aura. Considering how young he is, it means he’s reached his level through many battles. That’s commendable, no doubt, but..."
</p><br><p>The atmosphere changed as a shadow fell over Helasa’s face.
</p><br><p>"I don’t like that you’re silent. You came here, to my house, so I want you to answer my questions when I talk to you."
</p><br><br><p>"My apologies, I just didn’t expect our meeting to happen this way. You’re right, I came to the Raven Beak specifically because my goal was to meet you in person, Ms. Helasa."
</p><br><p>Then, he pulled a dark coin with a bloodstain from his pocket, the Norax’s token.
</p><br><p>For the first time in a long time, Reyla’s cheerful expression turned cold and frightened as her knees trembled and Helasa’s eyes widened in disbelief.
</p><br><br><br><p>"You’re quite an unusual Phantom, aren’t you? What’s your name?"
</p><br><p>Adam clenched the token and replied confidently:
</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter. That’s my name."</p>
