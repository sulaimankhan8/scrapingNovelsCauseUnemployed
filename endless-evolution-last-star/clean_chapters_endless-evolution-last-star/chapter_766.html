            <br><p>The Savage Broako was supposed to be Adam's last opponent, but once the monster was released from the crimson crystal, Adam realized that it was not the one he was looking for.</p><br><p>He had only two options left - the black coffin and the bloody pond, but before that, he had to defeat the only guardian.</p><br><p>The other monsters were still around, keeping the ritual active. They withstood Adam's aura attack and went back to work. He didn't have time to kill each one individually, first, he was hindered by two commanders, then he faced the Savage Broako.</p><br><p>"Are you saying he's the strongest? Hmm... I can't say I can sense anything special in his aura, but he looks pretty strong, that's for sure."</p><br><p>Before the fight started, Silvana contacted him:</p><br><p>'What are you going to do? There's a chance that you won't be able to cancel the ritual in time, or that it can't be done anymore, no one knows that for sure not even Lone Blaze. In that case, using one of the trump cards could be a mistake.'</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam cast his gaze toward the coffin and the bloody pond. He tried to sense something, but despite the short distance he could not, it seemed that the two objects were out of his range.</p><br><p>Then, Adam glanced at his chest. He had another crystal of the sun seal, but he still wanted to save as many resources as possible for the final battle.</p><br><p>With a noticeable jolt, the Savage Broako stepped forward, rumbles rang out at his slow, heavy stride, compared to the last guardian, even the Mighty Commander seemed small.</p><br><p>If Adam would just stand in one place, Savage Broako could crush him with his palm like an insect.</p><br><p>[Go ahead, use my power. The faster you kill him, the better chance you have of interrupting the ritual!]</p><br><p>Adam didn't answer anything, he only raised his head when a large shadow fell on him. It only took The Savage Broako a few steps to close the distance between them.</p><br><p>Then, the Savage Broako pointed his short finger at Adam and ran his thumb along his neck, not just challenging him but condemning him to certain doom.</p><br><p>"Come on, after such a brazen gesture you have something impressive to show for it, don't you?"</p><br><br><p>With a loud grunt, the Savage Broako raised his cleaver high up, clutching the long hilt tightly with both hands.</p><br><p>With a satisfied smirk on his face, the Savage Broako brought his cleaver down on Adam.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Though the monster was large, a true heavyweight, it was not lacking in speed. Every few seconds, the rusty cleaver rained down in the same spot. A shudder went through the entire temple, a cloud of dust rose high up, only the broad shadow of the blade was visible through the veil.</p><br><p>Somewhere in there, in the very center was Phantom, who could hardly lift such a heavy weapon, now he had to somehow survive the endless string of attacks.</p><br><p>"Grha! Ghahahahahahah!"</p><br><p>The Savage Broako was enjoying himself as the event unfolded. He had been imprisoned by the crystal for a long time, it had a positive effect on his strength, but this was no different from captivity, he had no freedom, no concept of time or entertainment.</p><br><p>Now, he had the opportunity to vent all his emotions on one Phantom. The only thing the Savage Broako hoped was that Adam wouldn't die too fast.</p><br><br><p>The figure ran out of the smoke screen, holding the flaming needle tightly, running quickly to the Savage Broako's feet.</p><br><p>Adam didn't often fight against such a large foe, it just so happened that his opponents weren't usually the size of a house, but he had some experience.</p><br><p>The main problem with large creatures was that they usually couldn't defend themselves, critical points without which it was impossible to fight.</p><br><p>'Well, it's the same as it was against Stone Goliath, one of my first monsters...'</p><br><p>With a cold stare, Adam stopped behind the Savage Broako before swinging his needle.</p><br><p>With one slash he cut the thick tendon behind his ankle, it was not a muscle, but without such an important tendon the Savage Broako would no longer be able to step confidently on his right foot or control it in any way.</p><br><p>Droplets of blood flew in front of Adam's eyes, he wasn't going to stop.</p><br><br><p>With the next breath, Adam found himself at the Savage Broako's other foot, executing an equally accurate slash.</p><br><p>Against such a strong and large opponent his flames weren't as effective, the Savage Broako's tough skin preventing the fire from leaving even light burns, but Adam didn't expect him to be able to turn the Savage Broako into a big lump of coal.</p><br><p>'Lone Blaze's powers are impressive, but my speed and needle sharpness are perfect for precision attacks, the Savage Broako won't be able to do anything to me.'</p><br><br><p>Strangely enough, the Savage Broako didn't roar in pain, he was rather surprised that Adam had somehow ended up behind him.</p><br><br><p>The Savage Broako turned his torso, about to approach Adam to grab him, but as soon as he did so his body tilted. His legs wouldn't obey him, they couldn't with this kind of damage.</p><br><p>Losing his balance, the huge body collapsed to the ground with a rumble.</p><br><p>Taking his chance, Adam tore into the rising cloud of dust, finding himself at the Savage Broako's head.</p><br><p>He raised the needle high, about to plunge the silver blade between the monster's eyes to burn its brain in an instant.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, the Savage Broako rose sharply, not allowing Adam to finish his move. A broad cleaver cut through the smoke veil, revealing Adam in a powerful wind current.</p><br><p>"What the hell...? How did you get up? Wounds like that just can't be ignored, it's part of your body..."</p><br><p>A baffled Adam directed his gaze to the Savage Broako's feet.</p><br><br><p>His eyes went wide in disbelief, there was no trace left of the two cuts, the tendons were intact as was the skin covering it, the wide wound on his chest was gone as well.</p><br><p>'Regeneration from energy that strong?'</p><br><p>That was the first thing Adam thought of, but he quickly decided that it was too fast for a simple effect.</p><br><p>Then, a realization came to him, a shiver ran through his body.</p><br><p>"You..." Adam stared at the Savage Broako, the smirk on the monster's face was wider than ever, "Bastard, are you a Regenerative Monster?"</p>
