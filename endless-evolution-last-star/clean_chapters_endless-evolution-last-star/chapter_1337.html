            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1337: Gloves of Silver Touch</strong></p><br><p>The first Adam’s Nexus, or rather its form, was gloves made of durable material with strings along the fingers. He used his Nexus in this form for a long time, but since the beginning of his journey, much had changed, as had his Nexus, which now consisted of five rings connected by chains.</p><br><p>Silvana had never had anything like this. This was not surprising, since even Operators receive their energy at a fairly late stage, before their abilities.</p><br><p>During her immersion in the illusion, when Silvana believed she was a Phantom and Adam was her Operator, she had a weapon — scissors, which eventually evolved into the Imaginary Cut, their joint and extremely powerful ability.</p><br><p>Now, Silvana looked at the white gloves woven from silver threads that covered her delicate hands.</p><br><p>[Gloves of Silver Touch]</p><br><p>No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t access any information more detailed than this. She felt that the gloves had some kind of ability, some special function, but she couldn’t understand what it was.</p><br><p>However, she could clearly see the threads of the Energy Axis moving toward her. They weren’t trying to touch her, but they needed her help, right now.</p><br><p>“Tsk. Adam told me how tedious this task is. Do I really have to do this?” Silvana frowned, even though she already understood everything.</p><br><p>She didn’t know what or who had brought her here, or what those gloves were, but now she at least understood what her goal was.</p><br><p>After a few moments, she took a deep breath and stepped forward.</p><br><p>She had to connect one thread after another, which would take a long time, a very long time. At least that’s what Silvana believed.</p><br><p>As soon as she touched the first thread, it did not run away, but instead shone brightly, attracting many others floating around it.</p><br><p>Many threads headed towards Silvana, quickly weaving into one powerful knot, taking on a part of all the threads at once.</p><br><p>Sure, that didn’t mean Silvana would be able to deal with everything quickly; she would need quite a bit of time for all the work, but it was obvious that after she got the gloves, the Energy Axis began to treat her differently.</p><br><p>A slight smile covered Silvana’s face as she set to work. She knew it wouldn’t be easy and that she would have to spend the next few days alone in the dark with only the Energy Axis as her source of light, but she was willing to accept that.</p><br><p>“Hah, now I’m starting to understand Adam. I want to see what these gloves are capable of, but I won’t be able to find out until I finish rebuilding the Energy Axis, right?”</p><br><p>Silvana wanted to finish the job quickly, but she didn’t rush because she understood that this was an important moment, not only for her but for Adam in particular. It was his power and an important stage in his evolution, Silvana couldn’t afford to make a mistake here.</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam slept peacefully, remaining in bed. His aura gradually grew while Silvana worked, but he did not yet know what was happening in his inner space, in its deepest depths.</p><br><p>But exactly six days after his battle against Karso, a change occurred. His heart began to beat faster, and his aura became as violent as a flame.</p><br><p>This could not fail to attract Narica’s attention, who hurried downstairs, but when she entered Adam’s room, she discovered that Norax was already there.</p><br><p>He sat on a chair with one leg crossed over the other, watching Adam’s aura with a sly smile on his face.</p><br><p>“Well, well, only six days? What do you say, Narica? Adam did it pretty quickly, right?”</p><br><p>“Sir, you’re already here?” Narica asked, puzzled and surprised at the same time.</p><br><p>Norax shrugged. “Of course, I am. I couldn’t miss a moment like this. I don’t know what Ureyn is doing right now, but I’m sure he would be surprised to see how strong Adam has become after their fight. I want to see his prime form, which he will reach in the next few minutes.”</p><br><p>In response, Narica just nodded slightly and stepped forward.</p><br><p>“I see. You’re right, this is a really important moment. But how could it happen so quickly? Misty said it would take three to four weeks, and even Karso, who is always overly optimistic, said it would take two weeks at best.”</p><br><p>“I think it’s simple.”</p><br><br><p>Norax’s lips curved upward.</p><br><p>“It’s all about his Operator, isn’t it? I’m sure that while that little bastard was sleeping, she was working to rebuild his Energy Axis.”</p><br><p>“But…” Narica placed her palm on her chest. “Didn’t Adam do the same thing at the very beginning? He worked on it for a whole month.”</p><br><p>He waved his hand. “Nah, back then, he was at the very beginning. In that case, rebuilding the Energy Axis is much easier than it is now. The last 1% is like doing half, if not more. The thing is, the threads must be woven perfectly, in combination with all the previous ones, as they close the circle.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Narica nodded deeply. Like everyone else, she also had the Energy Axis and was going through a restructuring. However, unlike Adam, she did it for a long time, patiently and carefully.</p><br><p>Also, unlike Adam, she did not have an Operator ready to take the final step towards new power.</p><br><p>Well, every race, humans and monsters alike, had their advantages and disadvantages. Everyone knew this, but not everyone was ready to accept it.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Silvana touched the last thread, carefully directing it straight to the main line. Before doing so, she looked back to see all the grandeur of the Energy Axis, the myriad threads that were now one.</p><br><p>Moreover, in this way, Adam completely absorbed the energy from the Connected Heart that he had received from Ureyn, as evidenced by the small golden glow coming from among the massive white waves of energy.</p><br><p>Silvana smiled faintly. She could feel how powerful the Energy Axis was, and it could only be good news.</p><br><p>“Alright, that was pretty hard, but it’s time to finish the job, right?” Silvana returned to the last thread before stepping forward.</p><br><p>The silver thread trembled as it lost Silvana’s touch, it took on a new color — a purple one, the only one among the myriad of white and a few golden threads.</p><br><p>Silvana’s eyes sparkled as she realized that this thread was the embodiment of her energy, her power. Her efforts had not gone unnoticed, and now her energy would be part of the Energy Axis, its final point.</p><br><br><p>The purple thread rushed to the tip, covering the last bright spot.</p><br><p>Then, there was silence.</p><br><p>Slowly, one stream of energy after another passed along the Energy Axis while Silvana stepped back, looking at her work.</p><br><p>Sure, she had only done 1% of the 99%, the rest was up to Adam, but she was the one who had made the final touch.</p><br><p>“Good, that’s wonderful…” She murmured as the Energy Axis began to vibrate intensely.</p><br><p>Before Silvana could realize it, a bright flash threw her out of the darkness — she had nothing left to do here as her mission was complete.</p><br><p>However, she did not return to the real world, as it was too early for that. She found herself in Adam’s inner space, seeing the Evolution Tree for the first time in six long days.</p><br><p>[You did a great job, Silvana…]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree’s praise was what Silvana wanted since she couldn’t hold back a smile.</p><br><p>“Yes, I believe so. Do you know what will happen now?” She asked, looking at the hundreds of small cracks covering the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>[Sure… Now we ascend to a new level of power… The one Adam attained in the first seconds after defeating Ureyn, but was not strong enough to bear the weight of his own power.]</p><br><p>Silvana folded her arms on her waist as she watched a bright light, white with a golden hue and tiny purple particles, appear from the countless cracks.</p><br><p>” In that case, I will wait.</p><br><p>[Hah… It won’t take long… young maiden…]</p><br><p>It was time for the second flash, many times greater than the first, but Silvana was not about to close her eyes. She saw how the light healed the Evolution Tree, how the cracks rapidly disappeared, and how the Evolution Tree’s aura became more powerful.</p><br><p>The last detail was the white gloves on her hands.</p><br><p>Without Silvana’s knowledge, the white gloves glowed and turned into two stars that headed straight for the Evolution Vein, which was the source of the Imaginary Cut.</p><br><p>“What…? I thought this would be my new ability?”</p><br><p>Silvana was puzzled, but soon a multitude of symbols appeared before her, showing her what she wanted to know about the gloves earlier.</p><br><p>“Ah, I see. After all, I am Adam’s ally, but I have already become a part of his inner space, which means I also belong to him, right?</p><br><p>She shook her head as her silhouette shattered into fragments. She was about to return to the real world.</p><br><p>“That’s pretty cruel, but I can’t say I have anything against it.”</p><br><br><p>Slowly, Adam opened his eyes, which shone brightly with a golden light for a split second.</p><br><p>Getting up from the bed, he saw Norax in front of him, who greeted him with a broad smile.</p><br><p>“Hey! Ready to go to the Silver Beacon?”</p><br><p>Adam was puzzled, and Narica was shocked that Norax was so abrupt.</p><br><p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
