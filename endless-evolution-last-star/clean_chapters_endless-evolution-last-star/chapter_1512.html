            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1512: The Ice Worm (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Almost every battle Adam fought in the Tarnished Lands was more like a duel than a wild battle.</p><br><p>In fact, Alexia was in the same situation.</p><br><p>They both always knew when an Elder wanted to attack them. Their aura was as obvious as their intentions.</p><br><p>It didn’t matter if it was an official battle like against Ureyn and Erada, or a sudden skirmish like against Menax. It was a human against a monster in human form.</p><br><br><p>The Primal Lands were a completely different story.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The earth shook as the huge ice worm continued to move upward, leaving Alexia helpless.</p><br><p>She couldn’t believe what she was seeing.</p><br><p>‘I didn’t even feel anything! How could such a giant sneak up on us? Why is it so fast?!’</p><br><p>Alexia didn’t realize it yet, but the feeling she was experiencing now was the same one she had felt in the early days of her path, when she had just become a Phantom.</p><br><p>The monster in front of her was a threat, unexpected and dangerous. What’s more, she didn’t know what to do.</p><br><p>Should she attack the ice worm? Maybe she should try to stop this giant? What did she need to do to save Adam?</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>The crack came from above as a long white blade, covered in darkness, appeared. In a wild whirl, Adam sliced open the worm’s belly.</p><br><p>Blood flew everywhere as his gaze, full of both panic and cruelty, reflected in Alexia’s eyes.</p><br><p>One of Adam’s eyes turned green as he used the Silver Weaver’s power to its full extent.</p><br><p>Alexia was wary of what she had seen earlier, but for Adam, a completely different picture was presented.</p><br><p>A moment ago, he was looking at the Frost Ridge in all its glory and the blue abyss, and then darkness engulfed him.</p><br><p>Hundreds of sharp teeth surrounding him sprang into motion, wanting to turn him into mincemeat like a giant crusher.</p><br><p>Adam couldn’t remember the last time he had thought so quickly. Even the battle with Menax, one of the most difficult battles in recent times, hadn’t made him this nervous.</p><br><br><p>With one last burst of speed and a trail of blood behind him, Adam landed in the snow in front of Alexia.</p><br><p>“Agh… Agh… Agh…” He breathed heavily as he looked at his shoulder, where there was a deep, jagged cut. Several teeth had managed to catch him, but he had acted in time.</p><br><p>Adam and Alexia exchanged glances as Adam spun around to look up.</p><br><p>He was sure that the ice worm should have died from its wounds, but what he saw made his face freeze.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The ice worm’s muscles trembled and tensed, stopping the bleeding, and barely noticeable streams of energy flowed to the edges of the cut to connect the flesh and hide.</p><br><p>Sure, it was a temporary solution and not a complete healing, but it was more than enough to continue the fight.</p><br><p>“What? He got rid of such a wound only with the help of his body strength and energy?”</p><br><p>“Adam!” Alexia exclaimed when the ice worm turned its head sharply in their direction.</p><br><p>A multitude of blue eyes located on its sides stared intently at them as the ice worm opened its jaw.</p><br><p>A bright blue light reflected off hundreds of teeth as the energy orb appeared between the worm’s jaws.</p><br><p>Adam and Alexia had seen this attack many times on their paths, and they knew what would follow.</p><br><p>The destructive energy ray crashed down on them as they simultaneously jumped to the sides.</p><br><br><p>The ray cut through the ground, covering the top of the mountain with a thick layer of ice with one light touch.</p><br><p>Adam turned to Alexia, realizing that if they wanted to win, they needed a plan, but Alexia knew this without him. She had already taken action.</p><br><br><p>She exhaled deeply as her aura trembled and her eyes became brighter and clearer, like ancient ice.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a white mist that was actually a myriad of tiny ice crystals floated around her. It looked more like a starry nebula than a light mist in a winter forest.</p><br><p>Thus, Adam immediately realized that it was not her pure energy, but her ability.</p><br><br><p>Alexia’s frame trembled as she jumped high into the air. Then, again and again, bouncing off the air, creating shreds of mist under her feet.</p><br><p>Before the ice worm could react, Alexia was already in front of the monster. She clenched her fist tightly, aiming for the ice worm’s lower jaw.</p><br><p>“Is she going to defeat it with a simple punch?” Adam thought, not yet knowing how wrong he was.</p><br><p>Alexia’s eyes reflected many figures resembling the shapes of weapons covered in shadow. However, from their shape, it was clear what kind of weapons they were.</p><br><p>When one of the forms chosen by Alexia stopped, the entire white mist trembled, and thousands of ice crystals rushed to take on the new shape necessary to defeat the giant enemy.</p><br><p>The moment her fist slammed into the ice worm’s jaw, a huge ice spear pierced the monster’s head, coming out with a bloodied blade.</p><br><p>The spear was several times larger than Alexia, and it was only one of the weapons available to her in this ability.</p><br><p>Adam gulped as he watched the giant spear that had killed an equally large monster. He finally saw what the current Alexia was capable of, a part of her power.</p><br><p>The ice worm’s numerous eyes quickly emptied, until…</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, the pupils in its eyes trembled, swaying from side to side until they returned to their place.</p><br><p>Alexia’s face paled. She couldn’t believe that even after such a wound, the ice worm was still alive and ready to fight.</p><br><p>“RRRRRRROOOOOOGGGGGGHHHH!!!!!”</p><br><p>A deafening roar, more like the rage of a blizzard, crashed down on Alexia as the ice worm’s body trembled. The monster was ready for its next lunge.</p><br><br><br><p>An invisible blade sliced through the ice worm’s neck, severing its head and finally ending the great monster’s life.</p><br><p>Blood gushed onto the ground as Alexia tried to recover from what she had seen.</p>
