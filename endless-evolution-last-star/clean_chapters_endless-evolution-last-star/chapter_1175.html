            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1175: Do it or die trying (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Adam used the teleportation chamber for the third time. However, this was nothing new for Fromund.</p><br><p>In most cases, the K4-Phantoms had no choice but to use teleportation, otherwise, they would have to spend most of the day aboard the fighter.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With a tremor, they found themselves in another teleportation chamber, but not on the spire, nor in the Citadel, but in one of the Bastions, at the Bastion Opard.</p><br><p>Before that, Adam had only been in one Bastion, at the Bastion Radon. It is located deep in the north, and he needed to do this to create the Elemental Root.</p><br><p>However, the Bastion Opard was located in the southeast, quite close to the Dark Shore. However, Adam and Fromund did not need to worry that they would encounter the Lords at the Corrupted Volcano.</p><br><p>Although the Corrupted Volcano was much closer to the Dark Shore than the Corrosive Lakes that were part of the Tarnished Lands, the distance was still very great.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Fromund looked around as they gradually came to their senses. They would have to go through a few more teleportations to completely get rid of the side effect in the future.</p><br><p>In time, it would happen.</p><br><p>A woman in a white military uniform stepped forward.</p><br><p>“Mr. Adam, Mr. Fromund, hello. I am pleased to welcome you to the Bastion Opard. I am aware of all the details of your mission. A two-seater, super-fast fighter is already waiting for you on the runway. You can leave at any time.”</p><br><p>Simultaneously, they nodded and followed the woman who led them to the runway through several turns.</p><br><p>For the first time, Adam needed much more time to deal with the side effects of teleportation, but after a few minutes, he was back to normal.</p><br><p>Fromund turned to Adam with a broad smile.</p><br><p>“This time, we’re not only on the same side, but we also have the same goal. I’m sure we’ll find those Twilight Crystals quickly!”</p><br><p>In response, Adam nodded slightly, a slight gloom filling his eyes.</p><br><p>“Yeah, I think we can do it. The strongest monsters at the Corrupted Volcano are the F3 Black Threat ones. So, we shouldn’t expect any High Elders.”</p><br><p>Fromund raised an eyebrow, puzzled. He hadn’t seen Adam in a long time, but a few months ago, Adam was completely different, more lively and cheerful.</p><br><p>But Fromund didn’t say anything, not now. First, they had to go to the Corrupted Volcano, where they would have more than enough time.</p><br><br><p>The fighter closed as the pilot started the engines, setting it in motion.</p><br><p>Instead of jokes and talk about the past, there was nothing between Adam and Fromund. Time and again, Fromund tried to understand what had happened to Adam, who was exuding an overwhelming gloom, but he couldn’t do it.</p><br><p>‘Hmm…’ Fromund crossed his arms over his chest, staring intently at Adam, who was sitting in the corner and just staring at one spot.</p><br><p>This was not what Fromund wanted to see. He did not want to see his former enemy, who had defeated him and avenged him, in such a state.</p><br><p>But Fromund was patient. He was not going to argue or make a scene in the fighters while their pilot was trying to fly through dangerous terrain to reach the Corrupted Volcano.</p><br><p>Gradually, the great outlines of the Bastion Opard disappeared over the horizon as they rose above the clouds. It was already evening, and the sky was dark with slowly appearing stars, but because of their height, a blue hue could be seen in the distance, quickly fading away.</p><br><br><p>Fromund drummed on his forearm, waiting for them to reach their destination.</p><br><p>Soon, the fiery lands appeared below, with numerous purple plants that had developed complete resistance to the heat. They were the reason why this area had become corrupt.</p><br><p>“Alright, guys, I’m ready to drop you in a minute. Are you ready?”</p><br><p>Fromund was the first to respond, unsure if Adam was going to say anything.</p><br><p>“Sure. Don’t worry about us. Thanks for your work.”</p><br><p>The pilot gestured his thanks as he pressed the button and opened the hatch.</p><br><br><p>Fromund stepped forward and shot Adam a piercing, irritated glance.</p><br><p>“Come on, Adam. We’ve got work to do.”</p><br><p>Without saying a word, Adam got up and stood next to him. It was the first time in over an hour that he had moved.</p><br><p>With a nod, they both jumped out, meeting the hot gusts of wind as the fighter flew away to turn around and return to the Bastion Opard.</p><br><p>There were many things Adam needed to think about. After all, they were on a mission, and a series of battles awaited them, as well as the hunt for the Twilight Crystals, but it was obvious that Adam’s mind was preoccupied with other thoughts.</p><br><p>Two streams of energy, white and red, enveloped their legs, slowing their fall. Adam hadn’t had much practice since last time, but after he opened the Path Construct and absorbed the Midnight Crystal, he had become a little stronger.</p><br><p>Now, it was much easier for him to control his falling speed, although flying, or rather standing in the air like Saegar or Erik did, was impossible for him.</p><br><p>No matter how much he practiced, he needed more energy and a higher density for something like that.</p><br><p>Fromund’s energy was not as stable as Adam’s, more like an aggressive flame, but he managed almost as well as Adam.</p><br><br><p>With dull thuds, they crashed to the ground, not far from the lava chute. Several tall, tree-sized plants stood nearby, their purple roots long since passing through the soil, feeding on both lava and energy.</p><br><p>In the distance, a volcano could be seen—the center of this territory. Lava flowed constantly from its crater, allowing new rivers to form across these dark lands.</p><br><p>Not wanting to wait any longer, Fromund frowned and approached Adam, who was standing in the middle of the room.</p><br><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam raised his head, meeting his gaze.</p><br><p>“Don’t you want to tell me what happened to you? Instead of a great warrior, I see some kind of loser standing in front of me!”</p><br><p>Fromund narrowed his eyes. He would not begin the mission until he got Adam to his senses.</p>
