            <br><p>Adam was confused, he was about to get out of the dark, unremarkable room where Kogen moved him for some reason.</p><br><p>But, before he could step into the passage, a large raven with amber eyes flew in.</p><br><p>Standing on a protruding rock from the wall, the raven stopped, folding its broad wings.</p><br><p>'What the hell? What's a raven doing in a place like this and... what's wrong with its eyes?' Adam thought, looking at the mysterious raven.</p><br><p>He hadn't felt any threat or powerful aura from the creature, but a strange feeling kept him from moving from where he was, staring intently at the raven.</p><br><p>"A-Adam... Vvvinter..." The raven said in a broken voice as if trying to copy the way humans spoke.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, a shiver rippled through his body.</p><br><p>In all his visits to the Dead Lands, he'd never met a talking monster or anything like it. He knew that some monsters were intelligent and could understand what humans were saying, but not talk.</p><br><p>'Wait, is that raven a monster? Even if it is, it doesn't look like it will fight... Is this all Kogen's idea?'</p><br><p>Adam tried to make sense of the situation, but there was no need for him to think.</p><br><p>All he had to do was have patience and listen carefully to his interlocutor.</p><br><p>"Stay here... Krh... Krh... Krh... Soon... Krh...</p><br><p>The second fighter will arrive..."</p><br><p>Throwing a glance towards the passage and looking around the room, Adam nodded slowly and sat down on a bulging old rock.</p><br><p>This room seemed like a dungeon in an abandoned prison, it was nothing remotely similar to one of the largest and most famous arenas in the Citadel.</p><br><p>'Well, this is the first time I've ever fought in any arena at all.'</p><br><p>Then, Adam looked intently at the raven.</p><br><p>"Hey, I'm not talking to a raven now, am I? This bird is merely carrying your voice, this raven is your live microphone."</p><br><p>He was confident in his statement as the raven acted calmly as if waiting for the next order.</p><br><p>"You're right... Krh... But... it's this raven's voice! Krh!"</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, folded his hands together, and directed his gaze into the darkness.</p><br><p>"In that case, who are you, do you work for Kogen Noukx? Are you his Operator?"</p><br><p>The answer didn't follow immediately, the mysterious persona took a long pause.</p><br><p>"You're right again... Krh... But... not about everything..." The raven raised its right wing, brushing dust off its long beak.</p><br><p>Adam gave the raven a questioning look.</p><br><br><p>The raven shook its entire body, making its feathers quiver before returning to its calm, stoic state.</p><br><p>"I don't work... for Kogen Nooooukx...! Krh!" The raven struggled to pronounce Kogen's name, "But... I am an Operator..."</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, trying to understand the meaning of the raven's words.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Does the Operator know how to control monsters? This all sounds too strange... Moreover, if the raven flew here, it means that this Operator knew what Kogen would do, even though it's not his Operator.'</p><br><p>Gradually, Adam realized that the raven was controlled by someone who knew he was there and someone who was on the same level as Kogen.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, there were only two people who fit that description, at least from what Adam knew - Erik and... Find exclusive stories on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"You're the Operator... You're Gladius's Operator, aren't you?"</p><br><p>A sharp glint passed across Adam's eyes. It was only his guess, but he believed it.</p><br><p>The raven stared at him for a long moment before turning aside.</p><br><p>"Wait... wait to be called into the arena..."</p><br><p>Though Adam didn't get an answer to his question, a slight smile still appeared on his face.</p><br><p>Sometimes, silence or ignoring a question was already an answer in itself.</p><br><p>'Damn... If I'm right, then Gladius's Operator is somehow able to control or summon monsters... Is it because his Operator is special, or is there something I don't know about this world?'</p><br><p>Adam had a lot of questions that no one was going to give him an answer to.</p><br><p>He shook his head and decided not to think about it anymore. The raven let him know that there was not much time left to wait and that was good news for him.</p><br><p>'Fromund Aegler, don't take too long...' Adam muttered internally, rubbing himself on the wrist.</p><br><br><p>About ten minutes later, a long black car stopped at the entrance to the Moon Colosseum. It was one of the many cars that crowded all the roads around it and the nearby parking lots.</p><br><p>Most of the spectator seats of the Moon Colosseum were occupied, as the moon was quickly disappearing behind the horizon line. That meant that, according to the rules, the fight would start very soon.</p><br><br><p>The door opened as Fromund stepped outside, tossing the empty energizer into the nearest trash can.</p><br><p>He confidently removed the stone case, his Nexus from the car, threw it on his shoulder, and headed forward. Fromund was here for the first time, but he knew he should go to the entrance - it was impossible not to notice which one.</p><br><p>"Agh, we're finally here." Zarot sighed heavily, getting out of the car and following behind.</p><br><p>Then, Fromund was quickly pursued by Elva, Liv, and Tilda, followed by Mariel who was afraid they would get lost in a place they were unfamiliar with.</p><br><p>Nirosh and Zarot walked at the end.</p><br><p>A few people who still hadn't taken their seats and were outside of the Moon Colosseum noticed their appearance.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, all their attention was focused not on the higher nobles but on the second fighter who was stepping confidently toward the arena, his opponent was waiting for him.</p><br><p>They immediately pulled out their phones to inform their buddies inside the arena.</p><br><p>People started placing bets faster, realizing that there was no more time.</p><br><p>In front of the main entrance of the Moon Colosseum, a lone girl stood, the wind fluttering her ruffled blonde hair long to her neck, and her green eyes uncertainly running from side to side as if she was looking for someone.</p><br><br><p>Gladius stood on the colosseum's top, watching as Fromund slowly approached the girl.</p><br><p>"Well, well, finally everyone is in place."</p><br><p>Gladius smirked, his eyes stopping on the girl.</p><br><p>"No Operator can't help but worry about their Phantom, especially at such an important moment, can they?"</p><br><p>Then, Gladius's silhouette shuddered, and he disappeared like a ghost.</p>
