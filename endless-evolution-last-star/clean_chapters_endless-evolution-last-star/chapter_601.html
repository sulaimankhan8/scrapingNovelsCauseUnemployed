            <br><p>"Are... Are we coming to the end?" Nelya muttered, watching Fromund's transformation into a fiery knight.</p><br><p>Franz sitting next to her, did not answer, his eyes watching Osana, who silently, without saying anything headed towards Silvana.</p><br><p>However, it was obvious to everyone that behind Osana's calm face, beneath her mask, lurked a panic, wanting to turn to despair. She was smart enough to realize that something was wrong, that the situation had drastically changed for the worse.</p><br><br><p>Clenching her fists tightly, Osana stopped in front of Silvana.</p><br><p>As if sensing her emotions, Silvana turned away, not wanting to talk to Osana right now.</p><br><p>"Operator... Turn to face me, or I swear... I'll make you do it."</p><br><p>A coldness ran down Silvana's back with waves of shivers, fear appeared deep in her eyes from Osana's commanding tone.</p><br><p>Normally, no one resorted to such methods, but... Silvana as Operator, had no right to disobey the Phantom, especially if they were on the same level.</p><br><p>"What...? What do you want me to say Osana?" Silvana mumbled uncertainly.</p><br><br><p>Before she could realize anything, Osana roughly grabbed Silvana's jaw, forcing her to look straight into her eyes.</p><br><p>"Why isn't he using it? Why isn't Adam using his Power Gene? He must respond with something to Fromund's ability, or he'll lose!"</p><br><p>Startled, Silvana only looked away, afraid to say anything.</p><br><br><p>Osana jerked her head, causing their gazes to meet again.</p><br><p>True, usually Silvana was stiff and cold, especially towards other people besides Adam and during work.</p><br><p>But... in front of K2-Phantom whose hopes were crumbling right now, she was nothing more than a helpless creature.</p><br><p>"He can't... In all his training and many attempts, he's never once succeeded in activating his Power Gene... Neither the Power Gene nor his Evolution Tree responded to him in any way."</p><br><p>Then, all the anger on Osana's face disappeared in a moment. She let go of Silvana and took a few steps to the side.</p><br><p>Her pink eyes lost their luster, becoming as empty and deep as the abyss.</p><br><p>She just remained standing in her place, not wanting to return to her seat next to Baren, watching the fight without any hope.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, she should have asked Baren's opinion, since unlike her, he didn't think it was over.</p><br><p>'Well, well, it looks like you're quite worried since you jumped to conclusions so early. Although... you've only recently become a K2-Phantom, so you don't have much experience in this matter.' Baren thought.</p><br><p>A bitter smile appeared on Baren's face as he watched Fromund take up his spear, gripping the hilt tightly.</p><br><p>'For some, the Power Gene opens immediately, for others, it's a formidable challenge. It's all rather unique. But... if Adam couldn't access his power in normal, quiet times, then isn't now the perfect moment for it?'</p><br><p>Sighing heavily, Baren leaned forward, his fingertips folded in a long gesture.</p><br><p>'It's been a tough story for me. Sometimes I think Evolution Tree is our hidden enemy, but... hah, it's our main savior who tries in every way to protect us from our insatiable desire to harm ourselves.'</p><br><p>Osana's despair was reflected in the satisfied smirks on the other side of the Moon Colosseum: Zarot and Nirosh were delighted when they saw Osana's reaction.</p><br><p>It was hard for Mariel to see Osana's plans crumbling, but for her, it was simultaneously a relief.</p><br><p>'My daughter... You're just still very young and belligerent. It was a good attempt, but it will be better if things happen as originally planned.'</p><br><p>"Hehehe. Looks like Adam's Operator couldn't give Osana a plan to win because it just isn't in existence!" Zarot chuckled evilly.</p><br><p>Nirosh nodded, agreeing with his father before pointing to Fromund, who was ready to attack.</p><br><p>"You know father, at first I had my doubts about your choice, but now I see that you and Mariel were right! Thanks to his flame, I'll get myself Osana!"</p><br><p>Having a similar feeling, Zarot shrugged with a satisfied smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Yeah, apparently, what saved us is that Adam is still a newcomer on the K2 field. He doesn't have enough resources to resist our flaming warrior!"</p><br><p>Under his exclamation, Fromund's silhouette trembled as he turned into a bright, fiery flash.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Fromund found himself facing Adam, his massive, hot spear crashing into the needle blade, leaving thin cracks in the silver surface.</p><br><p>The impact threw Adam aside, nailing him to the wall.</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could get up, or even open his eyes after the painful collision, Fromund already appeared in front of him, his spear thrust for an attack, high up.</p><br><p>Adam's one pupil narrowed, his body driven by instincts blocked the attack that followed a moment later, then another and another.</p><br><br><p>Fromund clenched his teeth tightly, putting all his strength into a lightning-fast series of strikes.</p><br><p>"Fuck! Adam, give up! If I have to I'll turn you into a pile of coals! I will if you keep defending yourself! It's over!" Continue your journey on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><br><p>His words didn't even reach Adam's ears, all of his instincts and body resources were focused on the speed of his reactions, on making sure he blocked each of Fromund's heavy attacks.</p><br><p>Every time his needle collided with the spear, a deafening pain went through his entire body, his arms went numb and his bones were ready to break at any mistake he made.</p><br><p>'No... Fromund is right... Just a little more, a few dozen more flaming attacks and I will reach my limit...'</p><br><p>Adam glanced at his needle at the same moment reflecting another of Fromund's strikes.</p><br><p>'So many cracks, once my needle breaks then it will be the end for me... Although... There's no telling what will happen first, will my needle break or will I reach my limit?'</p><br><p>Then, Adam's eyes darkened, losing their rich blue color.</p><br><p>'It's sad... I wanted to win so badly after so many defeats... And I have a chance... I just need more power!'</p><br><p>At the same moment, his eyes turned completely black and Adam blinked once going to further defend himself from the barrage of attacks.</p><br><br><p>Opening his eyes, Adam saw only the massive Evolution Tree in front of him.</p><br><p>The snow-white branches like the massive trunk of the great tree were actively trembling, but not out of fear or delight...</p><br><br><p>[You decided to forget a part of your history and... what became of you?]</p><br><br><p>[I'll help you remember.]</p><br><p>[You'll see what it means to desire to win again - all the way to the end.]</p>
