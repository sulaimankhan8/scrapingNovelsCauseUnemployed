            <br><p>Did Kreyna ever think about her death?</p><br><p>Sure. She hoped it would never happen, but in her long life and dozens of battles, several times she had to find herself on the verge between life and death.</p><br><p>Well, each time she had either come out victorious or escaped, far more often the first happened. She survived no matter how dangerous the situation was.</p><br><br><p>The day she and Arnoth could finally have a chance to move on to the next stage.</p><br><p>This day was her last.</p><br><p>"No..." Kreyna gulped, looking at the hungry jaw.</p><br><br><p>The jaw closed, making Kreyna's upper body disappear. Less than half remained with a wide tooth mark.</p><br><p>Torz's eyes went wide as he pointed forward.</p><br><br><p>Grita leaned forward, trying to understand what was happening. "What the...? Is their fight over?"</p><br><p>They didn't know why, but cracks began to spread across the dark sphere. One by one, hundreds of fragments crumbled to become black particles.</p><br><p>In the middle of the sphere stood Risha, who slowly fell to her knees. She was exhausted, it seemed if she took one more step she would pass out, but there was a fire in her eyes and a satisfied smirk on her face.</p><br><p>Her enemy's fate was a million times worse.</p><br><p>"This is..." Torz stammered, looking at what was left of Kreyna. "Fuck, that girl, she actually did it. She killed Kreyna!"</p><br><p>Overjoyed, Torz clenched his fist tightly, pressing it to his chest. For him, as a serpent, this was a big step towards victory.</p><br><br><p>Grita placed a hand on his shoulder, she couldn't hide her joy as well.</p><br><p>"Yeah, this is incredible, but we must not forget that this is not the end. Risha did a good job, but in her current state, she won't be able to defeat even a light soldier."</p><br><p>Torz nodded deeply, it cost him a lot of energy to put his joy aside.</p><br><p>"Sure, you're right. That's why we should go to her right now and make sure she's not in any danger. And..."</p><br><p>Simultaneously, their gazes rose towards the throne room.</p><br><p>Many serpents that noticed Risha's victory, how the dark sphere shattered and what was left of Kreyna, did the same.</p><br><p>Deep inside, every serpent realized that it was still too soon to celebrate the victory.</p><br><p>Yes, the serpents had practically surrounded the castle. The Light Legion troops had lost the overall battle, and all they could do was either die or retreat to the castle. The ring of resistance was narrowing around the castle more and more with every passing minute.</p><br><p>Moreover, Kreyna was dead. One of the two strongest monsters was gone.</p><br><p>But, the problem was that Kreyna was the weaker of the two strongest.</p><br><p>In the end, the only thing that mattered was Arnoth.</p><br><p>If Kreyna were left alone, she could do nothing against the resistance forces, Torz, Grita, and the others.</p><br><p>Yet, even left almost alone, Arnoth was a threat to everyone.</p><br><p>And, among the hundreds of serpents, there was only one man who could stand up to Arnoth. Ironically, it wasn't a monster, it was the Phantom.</p><br><br><p>Jets of darkness were coming out of Adam's first needle. His gaze was calm.</p><br><p>Heret was wounded, but death wasn't a threat to him. At least as long as Adam was here to stop Arnoth from finishing what he had started. Heret simply stepped aside, he could no longer take part in the battle.</p><br><p>Slowly, Arnoth lowered his gaze.</p><br><p>Adam sensed it as well.</p><br><p>Of the three auras downstairs, only two remained on the first floor. One had weakened after the explosion, and they both realized it was Vorx. The second and third continued to fight intensely until a few seconds ago when one of them disappeared completely.</p><br><p>"Oh..." Arnoth wheezed, he sensed who it was immediately. "Kreyna has lost. That's too bad... She won't get to see one of my greatest fights in our history."</p><br><p>Something in Arnoth's words alerted Adam.</p><br><p>'Wait, he's upset not because she died but because she won't get to see us fight?'</p><br><p>There seemed to be nothing unusual about it, Arnoth just thought he was far more important than Kreyna, but... Adam didn't believe it.</p><br><p>'No, if he says that, then she's significant to him. She's dead, and yet he's acting like it's not over. Could it be that he might...?'</p><br><p>"Don't torture yourself with guesses."</p><br><p>Arnoth's voice rang out, bringing Adam out of his musings.</p><br><p>"It's not something a young Phantom like you or the monsters in this region can understand. My history with Kreyna goes beyond that, yet... We had to take a step back to stay alive in this world."</p><br><p>With a slight pause, Arnoth pointed his sword at Adam, but he wasn't going to attack. It was just a gesture, and Adam could feel it.</p><br><p>"Why..." Adam frowned. "Why is it that every time you talk about me or serpents, you mention how young we are? How old are you? 30? 40? 50? How old?!"</p><br><p>"Gha... haha..." Arnoth's ripped laughter burst out through his armor. "Young man, don't make me laugh. 30 years old? The mere thought of me being 30 years old is much more than that. Like I said earlier, don't torture yourself with guesses."</p><br><br><p>Arnoth stepped forward, his aura growing stronger with every step he took. A shudder went through the entire throne room, the pillars shook, but the light from the crystals still burned brightly illuminating their battlefield.</p><br><p>"You are too young, and it is at this particular period that this is your curse, not your blessing. If you were born a few decades later or earlier, this battle would most likely never have happened. You'd be too strong for me to even scratch you.</p><br><br><p>Slowly, streams of golden energy traveled towards Arnoth's sword, allowing him to finish speaking and Adam to hear every word.</p><br><p>"But today is the day. Your day of death, young talent."</p><br><p>The next thing Adam saw was Arnoth's trembling frame. Before he knew it, Arnoth surged forward, leaving the golden ripples behind.</p><br><p>Then, Arnoth's shield weighed a multitude of tons as the moving mountain crashed straight at Adam, engulfing him in its shadow amidst the bright light.</p>
