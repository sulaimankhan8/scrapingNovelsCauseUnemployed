            <br><p>Adam and Reinz couldn't believe what they were hearing.</p><br><p>Neither of them knew how Erik was aware of what they needed. Moreover, just as Adam didn't know what the Void Lake was, Reinz didn't know why Adam needed to go to the Lower Ring.</p><br><p>It seemed that the Lower Ring and the Upper Ring were simply two parts of the Citadel. However, crossing this invisible border was quite rare, most often it was done by special people from the government.</p><br><p>For an ordinary person or nobleman, there was practically no reason to go down to the Lower Ring.</p><br><p>What about those who lived at the Lower Ring?</p><br><p>Well, there might be many ordinary people who wanted to go up, but they didn't have the opportunity.</p><br><p>The Lower Ring wasn't a slum like the borders of the Upper Ring where Adam lived most of his life, it was a place with its own rules and responsibilities to the Citadel.</p><br><p>After all, without the Lower Ring, there would be no Citadel in the first place...</p><br><p>"What... the Void Lake...?" Reinz gulped.</p><br><p>It seemed that even for him, a K3-Phantom from the Alderran Family, it was an inaccessible place. If he wanted to get there, he needed help from someone from the very top.</p><br><p>For Adam, Erik's offer was tempting too. He wanted to go to the Lower Ring to meet Wilfred and learn more about Aiden and the Citadel, but every time something stopped him.</p><br><p>First, it was a warning from Damien who said he was too weak. Then, the long battles and The Rule of Power which Osana dragged him into.</p><br><p>Then the Two Walls proved too important a task to just forget about and look for a way down.</p><br><p>But, now after the Twilight Palace, he had that opportunity.</p><br><p>The Crystal Gates needed to be opened to reach the K4-Level, but it wasn't the first priority because Adam didn't know about all the conditions for unlocking the four remaining gates.</p><br><p>'Hah...' Adam smiled bitterly internally, 'Just like he said... We can refuse, but we hardly want to. It's only one week. What reason do I have to decline? I see only benefits, for myself...'</p><br><p>Then, Adam's expression became more serious.</p><br><p>"Mr. Erik, perhaps I don't know what the Void Lake is, but... Your offer sounds too good. Don't you want anything in return?"</p><br><p>Reinz nodded silently. He didn't say anything but agreed with Adam. It looked suspicious.</p><br><p>However, all they got in return was a mocking laugh.</p><br><p>"Hahahahah! Adam, don't make me laugh!" Erik patted the table.</p><br><p>"No offense, but..." a sharp glint ran across his eyes, "What can you offer a man like me? I have more money, power, and information. I have superior strength and influence."</p><br><p>"Probably the only thing you surpass me in is your young age, but over the years I've gained valuable experience that you don't have. I mean, at the moment, there is not a single aspect in which you are superior to me."</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz's faces twitched.</p><br><p>Neither of them was pleased to hear such a thing said to them, but the worst part was that Erik was right.</p><br><p>Julia watching them only smiled slyly.</p><br><p>"Well..." Erik lingered, "Maybe I do need something from you..."</p><br><p>Their eyes opened wide shining like stars.</p><br><br><p>'I knew he was hiding something!'</p><br><p>Erik took a deep breath, "Results. I want results."</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz froze. This was not what they had expected.</p><br><p>"I'm only giving you seven days - you can open the second lesser gates, and get your rewards. If you fail, I won't waste any more of my time on you."</p><br><p>His eyes grew deeper.</p><br><p>"The Citadel needs strong Phantoms, as many as possible and as fast as possible. So I will give you time to think."</p><br><p>Erik raised the cup pointing at it, "I have three sips left. As soon as that happens I will demand an answer from you."</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz nodded deeply. They frowned in thought, waiting for Erik to give them enough time.</p><br><br><br><p>After only five seconds, the cup was on the saucer, empty.</p><br><p>"So..." Erik leaned forward, his hands folded in a lock, "What will your answer be? I hope you realize you shouldn't keep me waiting?"</p><br><p>There was no other choice, they had to answer.</p><br><p>Reinz was first, "If you can actually pave my way to the Void Lake, then I agree. I will open the second lesser gates in seven days."</p><br><p>With a slight smile, Erik nodded before looking at Adam.</p><br><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly, "Well, like you said, it's too good an offer to pass up. I'm ready for it. What do you need to do?"</p><br><p>"Oh, rush right into action? I like it, but there's no need to hurry things up. After all, this training won't just be for the two of you." Erik said as he snapped his fingers.</p><br><p>At the same time, Julia stealthily clicked the remote.</p><br><br><p>A door on the far side of the room opened revealing two silhouettes - a tall girl with black hair and green eyes and a second girl, with eyes as blue as the ocean and long, wavy blonde hair with a hint of gold.</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz's eyes went wide as they simultaneously exclaimed:</p><br><br><br><p>The two girls smiled awkwardly, waving to their Phantoms.</p><br><p>"Hi." Silvana cast a shy glance to the side.</p><br><p>"We didn't mean to eavesdrop... It just so happened..." Chloe stammered out, scratching the back of her head with a short laugh.</p><br><p>Without delay, Erik waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Ladies, have a seat at the table, my wife has prepared some excellent desserts. There are enough for everyone, everybody can savor the flavors."</p><br><p>The girls froze in place and Adam and Reinz looked at Julia in disbelief.</p><br><p>"WHAT?!" Adam pointed at her, "You're his wife?!"</p><br><p>In response, Julia mockingly showed her tongue and raised her right hand, fingers out to the side. On her finger was a platinum ring, no gemstones but exquisitely engraved.</p><br><p>Erik's hand had the same ring on it, there could be no mistake.</p><br><p>They only noticed it now.</p>
