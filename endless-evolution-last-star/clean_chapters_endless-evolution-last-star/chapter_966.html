            <br><br><p>At the same time, Hygon raced along the lava river, having already reached the place where Adam and Risha were fighting against the Rock Worms.</p><br><p>He stopped, looking at the remains of the worms and the bits of Risha's energy still in the air.</p><br><p>With a wide grin, Hygon chuckled. "Hah, I've been telling her to go on a deadly mission for a long time. Risha, that little girl, always acts overly cautious. She tries to be like her older brother but she doesn't realize that he does it because he calculates everything ahead.</p><br><p>"Well, she was in a unique situation. The Light Phantom helped her become stronger. Now that's a story she can brag about for a long time!"</p><br><p>Then, Hygon rushed forward, leaving behind a crater on the ground, a shiver echoing for dozens of meters from his powerful leap.</p><br><p>Someone as strong as him could single-handedly kill Arnoth, Kreyna, and all the serpents, completely destroying the Fallen Ring Castle, but there was no way Hygon would do that.</p><br><p>The reason wasn't just because Orel asked him to watch over Risha and save her if necessary.</p><br><p>There was something else.</p><br><p>As he approached the Fallen Ring Castle, Hygon's aura became quieter, unnoticeable to any K3-Phantom and the Red Threat Monsters. His always cheerful expression was replaced by a serious one.</p><br><p>If Risha was in danger, he would not engage in battle, it was too dangerous for everyone because something at the Fallen Ring Castle could resonate with his powerful energy and lead to disaster.</p><br><p>'I'll just watch from the sidelines like Orel asked,' Hygon thought, seeing a bubbling waterfall in the distance that grew closer with each leap he took.'</p><br><p>'I hope things don't get out of hand too quickly. Otherwise, I'm going to take Risha by the collar and run away from here, the main thing is to not let my emotions and energy flows come out.'</p><br><br><p>Hygon stopped on a slope ten meters above the waterfall, looking up at the castle and spire from the highest point.</p><br><p>He saw three silhouettes at the scarlet cliff approaching the cave.</p><br><br><br><p>Vorx disappeared into the shadows first, followed by Risha. Adam was about to follow, but for some reason, he stopped.</p><br><p>Something made him frown as he glared up, straight into the void.</p><br><p>Then, Adam shook his head and faded into the cave.</p><br><p>A wide grin showed, causing Hygon to genuinely enjoy it.</p><br><p>'Well, well. He noticed me watching him. Risha walked on unaware of anything. Despite the eagerness he fights with, he acts cautiously. Hah, it's like me and Orel fused in one unit. Not bad, not bad at all, though I don't like it.'</p><br><br><p>For a while Adam and Risha followed Vorx further into the dark, abandoned mine.</p><br><p>Soon, dim lights showed up in the distance, growing larger with each step, until they ended up at a small field. Only a burning stone torch was in the very center.</p><br><p>Risha wanted to ask Vorx something, but before she could utter a word, he turned around and grabbed her by the shoulders.</p><br><br><p>A flaming projectile slammed into the spot where she stood a moment ago, leaving a puddle of magma on the ground.</p><br><p>If not for Vorx's timely reaction, Risha would have gotten a serious burn at best.</p><br><p>Adam as the second Phantom was under threat as well. Two fiery projectiles flew towards him reflecting in the walls.</p><br><p>Vorx wanted to yell at him to dodge but stopped himself.</p><br><p>If any of the Light Legion heard them, they would be in serious trouble.</p><br><br><p>Realizing there was no point in escalating the situation, Adam stepped right, then left, dodging attacks with minimal movement.</p><br><br><p>His voice a little louder than a whisper rang out, raising the looming tension to a new level.</p><br><p>"If you're rebels you should be smart enough to realize that it was Vorx who brought us here, not us who made him bring us to your secret hideout."</p><br><p>The attacks stopped.</p><br><p>The figures merged with the shadows and disappeared in an unknown direction. Then, from the northern passageway came quiet but steady footsteps.</p><br><p>A tall man with short black hair and the same scales as Vorx walked forward. To his left was a young boy with a mistrustful look, to his right a woman with short to shoulder-length silver hair.</p><br><p>They were slightly different from each other, but they all had distinct signs that they were not humans or Crown Monsters, but Serpent Folk like Vorx.</p><br><br><p>Vorx stepped forward, standing one step in front of Adam in case things didn't go according to plan.</p><br><p>"This... Vorx, why did you bring the Phantoms here? No, more to the point... How did you do that?" the man frowned heavily, trying to contain his aura.</p><br><p>Instead of answering his question, Vorx ran his hand over the three serpents, introducing each of them.</p><br><p>"Adam and Risha, meet my allies, rebels like myself. The first is Torz," he pointed to the young man.</p><br><p>Then, looked at the woman.</p><br><br><p>Then, he smiled weakly looking at the man in the middle who with all his appearance showed that he was in charge.</p><br><p>"Lastly, my friend and leader of the resistance - Heret."</p><br><p>Heret stepped forward, his eyes narrowed, glaring menacingly at Adam and Risha. He was not pleased that in their secret hideout were the Phantoms. Moreover, even without sensing Adam's aura, all the serpents felt that he was dangerous.</p><br><p>Without wasting any more time, Adam stepped forward to meet Heret's gaze.</p><br><p>At the same moment, many other serpents appeared from the caves. They were ready to protect their leader and rush into battle at any moment. If Adam did anything suspicious, they would react immediately.</p><br><p>Adam extended his hand to Heret.</p><br><p>"Pleased to meet you. Vorx already introduced me. My name is Adam Vinter."</p><br><p>His eyes grew deeper.</p><br><p>"I am not your friend, but I can be an ally since I came here to kill your enemy."</p>
