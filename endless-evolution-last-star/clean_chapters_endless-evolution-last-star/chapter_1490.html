            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1490: The Strongest and Dinner</strong></p><br><p>The only guests Adam expected besides his family were Louis and Alexia. But, as fate would have it, two more guests came to his party, and they were people even the leaders of the Befallen Crown could not refuse.</p><br><p>If Damien and Beth wanted to attend the royal dinner in the capital of the Befallen Crown, then, despite hundreds of years of enmity, the monsters would prepare special seats and dishes to their liking.</p><br><p>They were among the few who could afford to do anything and not worry about the consequences.</p><br><p>Obviously, this was only possible because of how powerful Damien and Beth were as his Operator and eternal partner.</p><br><br><p>Damien put his wine glass aside and nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“Damn, this is excellent wine! Louis, you must convey my gratitude to your father!”</p><br><p>Louis, who was sitting opposite him, nodded deeply. His heart was beating fast solely because Damien himself was sitting at the same table with him, but he tried to keep a calm expression.</p><br><p>“Thank you, I’m sure he’ll be pleased.”</p><br><p>But those who were most surprised were not Adam and Alexia or Silvana and Louis, but Adam’s family.</p><br><p>Sure, Leona, Gary, and Trici weren’t connected to the Dead Lands, but over the past year and a half, since their son had become a Phantom, they had gradually learned more and more. Most often, Silvana told them about it, or they took an interest in the subject themselves, but sometimes Adam himself told them about his missions.</p><br><p>Obviously, like almost every resident of the Citadel, with a few exceptions, they knew who Damien was.</p><br><p>He was the strongest Phantom of the Citadel, the one who was capable of defeating any monster and protecting the walls from mortal danger. He was one of the reasons why the Citadel still existed and had not been destroyed by monsters.</p><br><p>At least, that was the public opinion about Damien.</p><br><p>It was practically impossible for an ordinary person to meet Damien by chance. Although in reality, it did happen by chance.</p><br><p>Damien did what he wanted, and no one could force him to do anything.</p><br><p>He could go for a walk in the park or attend an elite party where only billionaires gathered.</p><br><p>It all depended on his mood and desires.</p><br><p>Now, when he learned that Adam had revealed the Third Grand Star, and even more so that Alexia, who was in a similar situation, was at his party, he simply couldn’t help but pay attention to it.</p><br><p>“Mr. Damien…” Leona began, wanting to ask a question.</p><br><br><p>“Just Damien. I know my status, but you can just call me by my name. After all, I and the entire Citadel owe you and your husband a debt of gratitude for giving us a Phantom like Adam.”</p><br><p>Leona shuddered, trying to adapt, but in real life, Damien turned out to be completely different from what she had imagined.</p><br><p>Gary and even Trici found themselves in the same situation. Gary knew about Damien about as much as Leona did, and from the same sources. Trici had seen many videos and edits related to Damien, compiled from his answers to various interviews and articles about him.</p><br><p>Like a child, she could only come to one conclusion: Damien was cool, very cool. That was enough to make her eyes sparkle like a night sky full of stars.</p><br><p>For them, Damien’s image was that of a powerful, ruthless warrior ready to destroy any monster that wanted to invade the Citadel and harm ordinary people. He was the protector of all humanity.</p><br><p>But, in real life, Damien sat in front of them, enjoying snacks and having casual conversations with people he had met for the first time, and they were not important politicians but ordinary people who had escaped poverty only because a Phantom had appeared in their family.</p><br><p>“I see.” Leona nodded. “Then… Why did you decide to come? From what I understand, Adam wasn’t expecting you today.”</p><br><p>“Well, I like to surprise people. Although it was my Operator’s idea.”</p><br><p>Beth, who was sitting next to him, raised an eyebrow. Her green eyes were sharp as daggers.</p><br><p>“Hmm? I just told you what I found out. Then, you decided we had to come here.”</p><br><p>Damien waved his hand.</p><br><p>“Don’t listen to her. She’s just shy.”</p><br><p>Beth rolled her eyes as she picked up her fork, looking at the shrimp, cream sauce, and pineapple.</p><br><p>“This one is delicious. Who cooked it?”</p><br><p>Silvana raised her hand uncertainly.</p><br><p>“I made it. It’s a simple recipe I found on a cooking website.”</p><br><br><p>“Beth…” Silvana began. “How did you find out about Adam’s progress and that a party was planned here? Those were messages between just me and him.”</p><br><p>In response, Beth looked at her as if it should have been a rhetorical question. She thought the answer was obvious.</p><br><p>“I just hacked you. That’s it. Don’t be surprised. With my level, I can access almost every device in the Citadel.”</p><br><p>She ate a snack as bliss reflected in her eyes for a moment.</p><br><p>“Agh… At first, I regretted telling Damien about it. I don’t like attending events or parties, but it turned out to be better than I thought.”</p><br><p>“Pfffft!” Alexia snorted. “You just barged in here! You two have no manners!”</p><br><p>Louis gave her a stern look. He couldn’t believe she was talking to Damien and Beth like that.</p><br><p>But Damien himself wasn’t too bothered.</p><br><p>“Hahahahah! Alexia, don’t puff out your cheeks, I didn’t just come here, I taught you and Adam how to fly!”</p><br><p>Alexia puffed out her cheeks anyway.</p><br><p>“Tsk. I could do it without your help. Well, almost. And anyway, it doesn’t matter! You came here and didn’t even bring anything to drink!”</p><br><p>Leona, Gary, and Trici looked at each other, puzzled.</p><br><p>“Agh? Can Adam and Alexia fly?” Leona asked.</p><br><p>Damien was silent for a moment before grinning.</p><br><p>“Yes, and I agree with Alexia. I should have bought something to drink.”</p><br><br><p>“Who wants to come with me to the store, or rather, fly?”</p><br><p>Leona gulped. As dangerous as it sounded, it also intrigued her.</p>
