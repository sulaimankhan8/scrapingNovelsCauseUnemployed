            <br><p>Hundreds of bright lights passed along the roads of the city like rushing rivers to catch a glimpse of the great event, the stars were their guide, telling the way where everything was going to happen.</p><br><p>Adam's gaze traveled lower, watching dozens of cars driving straight toward the Moon Colosseum.</p><br><p>The Marzo Family had not yet chosen a second fighter, the betting was not open, but everyone realized that the fight would inevitably occur.</p><br><p>The time limits and rules regarding The Rule of Power were strict and clear. Moreover, because Gladius and his purple room as well as the Noukx Family were involved, the stakes were already too high to refuse or try to cheat the system somehow.</p><br><p>"How many people..." Adam muttered, his deep gaze slowly traveling from one machine to the next in a futile attempt to keep track of each one.</p><br><br><p>Adam looked at Kogen over his shoulder. Even though Kogen was disproportionately above him in status and strength, Adam didn't feel any tension or pressure. In a strange way, Kogen made him, and the others, feel just as comfortable at home.</p><br><p>"I will fight not for the sake of showing you and the other viewers, but for Osana since I promised to fulfill her wish." Adam said stiffly before returning his gaze to the lights shining in the distance.</p><br><p>"Brrrrrrrh! What a cold answer! I'm going to freeze now!" Kogen shuddered, shaking his head from side to side.</p><br><p>Then, he smirked and looked at Osana.</p><br><p>"So it was your wish, then? Well, well, I'm curious, at what point did you realize that Adam could be your saving ticket?"</p><br><p>Osana remained silent, she only smiled awkwardly.</p><br><p>"Hey..." Kogen wheezed, "That was a question I want an answer to."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>For a moment, shorter than a heartbeat, everyone felt Kogen's aura increase, his power making everyone flinch except Gladius and Erik who ignored the situation.</p><br><br><p>"Sorry, I thought that was a rhetorical question." Osana coughed, preparing to answer.</p><br><p>She didn't want to do that, especially when Adam was a few meters away from her and heard everything, but... did she have a choice?</p><br><p>"Initially I had the idea when I first saw him, then the thought of it became more and more obsessive, especially when we were fighting against Plague Reaper."</p><br><p>Osana cast a quick glance at Adam before continuing: "When we were close to victory and all my squad members were alive, I was already confident in my choice, but... I didn't know how I could convince Adam to participate in an event of this magnitude for me."</p><br><p>Kogen listened carefully, he wasn't lying about his intentions, he was actually curious to know where it all started since Osana was the catalyst for all these events.</p><br><p>If it wasn't for her three wishes, Adam wouldn't be here as well as the hundreds of nobles and influential people involved because of the purple room and the Moon Colosseum.</p><br><p>"However, then things got too dangerous. Plague Reaper killed my mates... one by one... The fight continued and became hazardous because of Midnight Crystal."</p><br><p>Osana bit her lip, remembering these events in every detail, her memory filled with fragments even those she tried to forget.</p><br><p>"I wasn't thinking about how to convince Adam anymore, I was trying to survive and do what I could to win. Then, at the very end when I saved Adam from Plague Reaper's fatal blow, something clicked in my head. I saw that this was my moment and I already did everything I could, so... my personality just couldn't let this chance go."</p><br><br><p>Kogen abruptly jumped off the couch, stepped forward, and approached Osana. He roughly grabbed her face, opening one of her eyes as wide as possible.</p><br><p>Baren and the others glanced over, he was outraged and bewildered.</p><br><p>Kogen's turquoise eyes reflected in Osana's startled look, she didn't understand what was happening or what she should expect.</p><br><p>Then, Kogen grinned widely.</p><br><p>"Heh, she's not lying, everything we heard is the pure truth coming from her heart. Good, I'm satisfied, Osana De Rouzet." Kogen chuckled evilly before returning to his seat.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Osana's honesty had a positive effect on more than just Kogen's mood.</p><br><p>Adam turned away as if wanting to hide something from Osana, a slight smile appearing on his face.</p><br><p>He understood what kind of person Osana was, constant calculations and cunning plans were her nature that she couldn't give up, but that didn't stop her from helping her fellows in deadly combat when needed.</p><br><br><p>Erik tapped his cane on the ground, drawing attention to himself.</p><br><p>"Adam, you're right. Fight as you see fit, don't think about spectators or bets, hahaha, that's our problems, the problems of gamblers mired in ludomania." Erik smiled broadly.</p><br><p>In response, Adam raised an eyebrow with confusion.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Are you going to place a bet?"</p><br><p>Erik let out a short laugh before nodding.</p><br><p>"Of course!" Erik swung his cane pointing at Gladius, who sat silently on the left side of the couch, "However... That tricky demon won't give me that opportunity until the Marzo Family announces a second fighter."</p><br><p>Gladius spread his hands apart. He didn't see the point of opening up a betting feature when there was only one option, though... he had more than two outcomes in mind.</p><br><p>'Hehehe, there could be other outcomes besides losing and winning, couldn't there?' Gladius pondered, a sly smile on his face, 'Rarer events will have bigger odds, and that's a good thing!'</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly, looking forward, he squeezed Silvana's shoulder lightly.</p><br><p>"Are you going to bet on me winning or losing?"</p><br><p>Erik didn't give a direct answer, he only adjusted his hat.</p><br><p>"Who knows? Maybe I'll change my mind when I see your opponent? I wonder who he is, where he is, and what he's doing now. There's not much time left...'</p><br><br><p>"Thanks for the food!"</p><br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda said at the same time, bowed low, and went to their rooms. Fromund sent them to bed since it was late.</p><br><p>Then, after a few minutes, Fromund got up from his chair and headed to his room. Stopping in the doorway, he glanced at Mariel, Zarot, and Nirosh.</p><br><p>"Well, it's time to find out why you came here. And from the looks of it, I'm going to have to be reminded again of the worst parents because of whom Elva, Liv, Tilda, and I are still forced to suffer..."</p><br><p>Fromund muttered with a dark stare, gesturing for them to follow.</p>
