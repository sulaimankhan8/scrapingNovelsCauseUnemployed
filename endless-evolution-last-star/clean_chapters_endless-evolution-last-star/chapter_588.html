            <br><p>The last episode of the attack made many viewers disappointed in their choices, their gazes grew darker as they thought that their bets on Fromund would soon turn into nothing, their money would be lost forever.
</p><br><p>While for Silvana it was obvious who to bet on, most viewers faced a dilemma.
</p><br><p>They had limited information about Adam and Fromund.
</p><br><p>Sure, each of them could easily recognize Adam’s past accomplishments, but anyone would be confused by the fact that all the data on him was from the time when he was K1-Phantom.
</p><br><p>There was much less information about Fromund, as unlike Adam, he didn’t have as many significant battles in his history as the fight against the Plague Reaper. Well, the Essence Thunder Demon amongst the cascade of anomalies also attracted considerable attention.
</p><br><p>Since the audience mostly included only nobles and influential people, it wasn’t a problem for them to find out that Fromund had worked for the Rouzet Family for some time, being a member of one of their Branch Squads.
</p><br><p>This was happening and after he became a K2-Phantom, his results were impressive, one of the best among Phantoms of the same level.
</p><br><p>So, while only someone who was behind the purple room could know this for sure if one were to assume that more people placed a bet on Fromund’s victory, that one would hardly be wrong.
</p><br><p>Adam’s gravitational punch and initiative interception strongly affected the spectators’ faith in the Fromund.
</p><br><p>Well, the other part of the spectators were smiling, their eyes shining with excitement and anticipation of easy profits as they too had bet on Fromund, not to win but to lose.
</p><br><p>One man’s defeat is another man’s victory, simple as that. In the Moon Colosseum, there was no way to draw, no matter by what means, the winner should be found.
</p><br><br><p>Stopping in front of his hammer, not yet lifting it from the ground, Fromund slowly turned around looking at Zarot, Mariel, and Nirosh.
</p><br><p>"Bastard... You told me many things but chose to keep silent that killing is not forbidden in this arena. Victory can be achieved by any means necessary."
</p><br><p>Though his voice was quiet and calm, but Zarot heard every word he said.
</p><br><p>It was true. Zarot intentionally left out this detail since he thought it might spook Fromund. After all, he wasn’t fighting for money, he was fighting for his little sisters to get to a normal life without the debt and fear that lingered from the Lower Ring for years.
</p><br><p>It was useless to answer, it was already too late, the contract was signed and the fight was in its most active phase.
</p><br><p>So... Zarot only shrugged, his gaze fixed on him as if to say: ’If you don’t want to die then win, it’s simple.’
</p><br><p>Fromund shook his head, bitterness filled his throat, he didn’t show it but he felt bad about being tricked as he in turn was honest.
</p><br><p>"Fuck, it’s the same as always... Well, at least you’re honest, right?"
</p><br><p>Throwing a glance at Adam who as if realizing what he was feeling right now, calmly waited for Fromund to be ready to fight.
</p><br><p>"Adam, thank you. You’ve shown me how high the stakes of this fight are. It’s not just money or honor, it’s life or death."
</p><br><p>"I’m surprised they didn’t tell you that."
</p><br><p>"Yeah, looks like I’m fighting for the interests of liars, I wasn’t as lucky as you." Fromund scratched the back of his head with an awkward smile.
</p><br><p>Steam continued to escape from his body, the artifact accelerated his heart to the breaking point, gradually pushing his body to its limit.
</p><br><p>But... for Fromund, his feelings and inner peace were more important than fleeting power.
</p><br><br><p>Fromund gripped the hilt of his hammer tightly, lifting his heavy weapon with a light movement.
</p><br><p>After that, he pointed his hammer at Adam, a bitter smile visible on his face.
</p><br><p>"In that case, if need be, if I have no other choice I will kill you. If I didn’t dodge your blow, I’d be smashed on the wall in bloody shreds."
</p><br><p>That was fair. Adam’s last attack showed him the previously hidden essence of their fight.
</p><br><p>"That’s acceptable..." Adam nodded slowly.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, the stone hammer shuddered. A bright light emerged from the depths, shining beneath the dark furrows running across the hammer.
</p><br><p>Soon, vapor began to emanate from the hammer as well as from Fromund, the temperature of the weapon rising enough for the solidified lava to melt off, returning to its magma state.
</p><br><br><p>The first glowing drops of lava fell to the ground, leaving black dots of burned dust, then the lava picked up speed moving quickly between the stones.
</p><br><p>Feeling the heat even a few dozen meters away, Adam sighed briefly.
</p><br><p>"Only made one attack with your First Order and already decided to activate your Nexus? I’m sorry, but I can’t follow you in terms of action anymore."
</p><br><p>"Hah, like someone asked you to repeat my moves before."
</p><br><p>Adam shrugged, slowly stepping forward, striding towards his shattered needle.
</p><br><p>Fromund waved his hand, he was grateful that Adam waited for him, but he had too little time.
</p><br><p>Continue your saga on NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>"Come on! Use your Nexus or bring your needle again, time to get back to the fight!"
</p><br><p>’Damn! I don’t think it’s good of me to do that, but... I don’t have much time. Just a little more and my body won’t be able to hold out any longer. The artifact is getting more and more powerful!’
</p><br><p>Tilda turned to Erik.
</p><br><p>"Hey... Can he create the needle again?"
</p><br><br><p>"Sure, it’s his First Order and after reaching K2-Level, the restrictions aren’t as tight anymore. But judging from his movements and look, he has another plan."
</p><br><p>"What...?" Tilda tilted her head in a baffled way.
</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.
</p><br><p>The two halves of the needle turned into flashes of light filling the recesses in the interior part of Adam’s gauntlets.
</p><br><p>His hands filled with pure, saturated energy, and his heart began to beat much slower, as if wanting to separate itself from Fromund’s furious heartbeat.
</p><br><br><p>Adam reached forward, gesturing for Fromund to come forward.
</p><br><p>"It’s foolish to use a fragile needle against such a massive weapon... So I’ll deal with your hammer with my fists."
</p><br><p>A wide grin formed on Fromund’s face.
</p><br><p>"I see. Nexus vs Nexus? I’m afraid you’re going to lose!"
</p><br><br><p>With a powerful stream of steam, Fromund disappeared, about to bring his hammer down on Adam from where he hadn’t anticipated.
</p><br><p>After all, he came here for victory and was determined to do whatever it took to get it.</p>
