            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1370: Fall in the tar</strong></p><br><br><p>Adam crashed into the red container as several drops of blood fell from his wrists, soaking into the cold, gray sand.</p><br><p>Even though it was an illusion, the sensations and atmosphere were real, or at least they seemed that way, especially for Adam, who had once experienced this life-changing event.</p><br><p>If the Silver Weaver had successfully attacked Adam, the wound would have been real, the pain would have been real, and the risk of death would have been real.</p><br><p>More than a year ago, Adam had managed to survive and escape from the tar lake, as well as kill the Silver Weaver.</p><br><p>But… Could he do it now?</p><br><p>The situation was similar, but at its root, it was completely different.</p><br><p>Back then, Adam was a nobody. He was just a young man who helped his parents and family endure their difficult life in the slums in his spare time. He did everything from collecting trash to working in a warehouse to simply cleaning the house.</p><br><p>Now, he was the formidable K4-Phantom, a stellar one, feared even by many ancient monsters because they saw his potential. For this reason, the First Star contacted him, as did the Befallen Crown, which tried to kill him at the Dark Shore.</p><br><p>However, even though he was much stronger now, did that give him any advantage against his first and most important enemy?</p><br><br><p>Adam stood up abruptly, wiping away a trickle of blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver slowly descended the hill like white death, leaving lines on the ground with its claws that disappeared with the next gust of wind.</p><br><p>“Damn, that was a powerful blow! That doesn’t mean I’m going to lose, I just need to get used to it!” Adam leaned forward, waiting for the Silver Weaver’s next move.</p><br><p>He decided to change his tactics. He was sure that if the Silver Weaver attacked first, he would have the opportunity to counterattack. To do it right.</p><br><p>For a long time, they just stared at each other until the Silver Weaver jerked his head up, as if giving Adam a hint.</p><br><p>Adam looked up as his eyes widened when a long cut opened up in the dark sky, resembling the crimson scar covering the Blighted Star Lands.</p><br><p>Then, a bright flash shot out of the cut as a chill ran down Adam’s back.</p><br><p>All his instincts screamed for him to dodge, even though he hadn’t yet seen what he was supposed to run from.</p><br><p>Nevertheless, he did.</p><br><p>As fast as he could, Adam lunged to the side.</p><br><p>All he saw was an invisible blade cutting a piece of his coat before reaching the ground.</p><br><br><p>More than ten meters of ground was split as sand rushed to fill the dark, abyss-like gap.</p><br><p>“Agh… Agh… Agh…” Adam breathed heavily, staring at the flowing sand. He didn’t know what kind of ability it was, but it was similar to the Imaginary Cut.</p><br><p>‘Shit, if I had hesitated even for a moment, I would already be dead!’</p><br><p>Then, Adam felt himself in the place of his opponents, who were about to face the Imaginary Cut — a great power that only a few could defend against.</p><br><p>But, unlike Adam, who could only use his trump card a few times before falling to the ground exhausted, the Silver Weaver had no such strict limitations.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Every time the Silver Weaver’s aura trembled, new flashes appeared in the sky, which soon rained down on Adam in a hail of invisible cuts.</p><br><p>Instead of fighting his enemy on equal terms, all Adam could do was dodge again and again, jumping around the tar lake.</p><br><p>One cut after another, they got closer and closer to their target until Adam finally made a mistake.</p><br><p>“Gha…?” Adam gasped in disbelief as he stared at the two green eyes that somehow appeared right in front of him.</p><br><p>He had paid too much attention to the invisible cuts, not noticing that the Silver Weaver had begun its attack.</p><br><p>‘He’s attacking? Like… right now?’ Adam’s eyes darted across the Silver Weaver’s large body. ‘Should I block or dodge? Is he attacking with his threads or his claws?’</p><br><p>A multitude of questions filled Adam’s mind as his thoughts became a veritable chaos. He tried to be prepared for every possible outcome.</p><br><p>It didn’t matter how long he thought, a fraction of a second or a year. He would not be able to understand his enemy’s true plans.</p><br><p>Slowly, the Silver Weaver opened its jaws before…</p><br><p>“ROOOOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRRR!!!”</p><br><p>The deafening roar caused shock waves that ran across the battlefield, shaking the sand and hills, and rippling the tar lake.</p><br><p>But it wasn’t just sound; it was a force that passed through Adam’s body, causing his legs to tremble until he collapsed to the ground.</p><br><p>Before his knees could touch the ground, a whip of silver threads struck his side as the shockwave threw him aside.</p><br><p>Completely losing control of the situation, Adam found himself in the center of the tar lake, sinking into the foul, filthy liquid, full of the smell of death and despair.</p><br><p>“Rgh…” The Silver Weaver growled, staring intently at the dark surface of the lake.</p><br><p>Nothing happened for the first ten seconds, but Adam couldn’t drown; the Silver Weaver didn’t believe it.</p><br><br><br><p>A slight tremor ran through the lake as Adam’s black hair and blue eyes appeared, staring down.</p><br><p>He looked at his reflection, at his helpless expression, at the weak young man who was waist-deep in the lake that was the dumping ground for the Morton Observatory.</p><br><p>Aiden Henk had sent him here, but he got out of here on his own.</p><br><p>Now, he had to do the same thing again.</p><br><p>“Tsk… What a pitiful sight.” Adam snorted before throwing his sword aside. No matter which of the two forms he used, it wasn’t enough to defeat the Silver Weaver.</p><br><p>If he wanted to win, he had to use all his strength like he did that day.</p><br><p>“It’s time to use even the most dangerous trump card, isn’t it?” Adam muttered as five rings connected by chains appeared on his hand.</p><br><p>“Alright, I’ll do it. All for the sake of victory.”</p><br><p>With a slight tremor, light ran through the rings, stopping at the fifth one for the first time.</p>
