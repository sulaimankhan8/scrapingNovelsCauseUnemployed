            <br><p>Like any contract, the Pact had requirements and conditions within it, but they were subject not to laws but to the rules of energy.</p><br><br><p>Stepping slowly into the void, Adam touched the Pact as the flame contract shuddered.</p><br><p>[The Pact - Lone Blaze of Lost Weaver.]</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>'Lost Weaver is me...? What the fuck? Why does no one ever praise me, not even the soulless contract? Is it so hard to write Cool Warrior or Great Fighter?'</p><br><p>Complaining inwardly, Adam lowered his gaze to the conditions and requirements, of each of them.</p><br><p>[Lone Blaze's part of the Pact:</p><br><p>- The monsters in Fortress of the Lone Serpent will not attack Lost Weaver, at least not until they face aggression from him.</p><br><p>- Lost Weaver has been granted a portion of the power of the Lone Blaze with limited uses but with full might.</p><br><p>- Lone Blaze agrees to keep in contact with Lost Weaver, informing him and assisting him as needed.</p><br><p>-On completion of the Pact, Lost Weaver will receive the following from Lone Blaze: ???]</p><br><p>Adam's eyes narrowed as he nodded deeply. Everything was within the scope of their discussion except the last point that was unknown to him until now.</p><br><p>'The Evolution Tree for some reason forbid Lone Blaze to speak of it, well... sooner or later I'll find out what they're keeping from me. Now, what about my part?' Enjoy exclusive chapters from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>[Lost Weaver's part of the Pact:</p><br><p>- Destroy the source of Lona Blaze's fear.</p><br><p>- Remain loyal to Lone Blaze until the end of the pact.</p><br><br><p>Adam's pupils dilated for a moment as a bitter smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"Hah, rather meager, isn't it? Though, all the most challenging things always look simple at first."</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand, stepping out of his inner space.</p><br><p>"Hey, you heard me and also know what I was doing in inner space, right?" Adam addressed someone.</p><br><p>The answer didn't come immediately, it was only a few seconds later that Lone Blaze's voice echoed in his head.</p><br><p>[Yes... But... I don't really have anything to say to you... You just need to keep moving forward...]</p><br><p>Adam sensed something familiar in Lone Blaze's voice.</p><br><p>'Oh, now it's talking like Evolution Tree, I hope it doesn't last too long, I can't handle two such disgruntled grumblers.'</p><br><p>Then, he looked around. The Pact was concluded, but Lone Blaze was still hovering in its place as External Artifact should, and... Adam still didn't know what he was supposed to do.</p><br><p>"Go forward...? But, where to?"</p><br><p>[Don't worry, I'll show you, but, don't count on my help other than my mark. It's the most I can give you in our situation.]</p><br><p>At the same moment, Lone Blaze trembled slightly, releasing active streams of flames.</p><br><p>The flames split into bright lines of fire, running up the walls.</p><br><p>The corners of Adam's lips went upward.</p><br><p>"Well, that's different."</p><br><p>With an excited smile, Adam stretched his shoulder about to climb up, he would have to scale the steep wall or try to jump to the edge.</p><br><p>But, before he could take the first step, Lone Blaze's shards shuddered catching his attention.</p><br><br><br><p>Like a single mechanism, the shards soared in front of Adam one by one, building a stair to the top for him.</p><br><p>"Hah, how kind of you. Well, let's see what I missed wandering the caves."</p><br><p>Without a moment's hesitation, Adam dashed forward, heading for the round platform.</p><br><p>He knew he needed to go down, that's where the First Wall had directed him, not considering Lone Blaze's chamber, the caves were the deepest point of the fortress.</p><br><p>So there was a hidden passage in the caves, at least that's what Adam thought, and... he wasn't far wrong.</p><br><br><p>Once at the top, Adam looked around with a glowing gaze, hoping to see a path further down, but... no secret passages opened up.</p><br><br><p>Instead, he saw flaming lines quickly heading towards a third statue, holding a massive ice sword tightly in its grip.</p><br><p>The other two statues facing each other went unnoticed, the flames simply ignoring them. They were only needed for one purpose - to see if the creature was worthy to face External Artifact.</p><br><p>Then, the lines touched the third statue quickly rising upward, passing through it.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The statue shook violently, cracks appeared on the surface, spreading farther and farther, reaching the wall that the third statue had long been attached to and already became a part of it.</p><br><p>With increasing shaking, striving to the top, through all levels of the fortress, from the third statue began to fall off pieces, first small stones, then it was the turn of massive debris.</p><br><p>The debris tumbled downward, colliding with the water's surface, their sharp tops showing from beneath the shallow lake.</p><br><p>Clouds of dust rose from the ones that crashed into the path, heading in Adam's direction, yet his gaze was fixed on only one point, wanting to know what was behind the statue.</p><br><p>"Fuck... So the passage was here all along? If I knew that I would have just destroyed the fucking statue!"</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Falling away from the wall, the stones revealed two black slabs of tough, light-absorbing material. They formed a gateway reaching the top of the cave, seeming to be even larger than the main gates to the fortress.</p><br><p>Each slab was engraved with a crimson image of a serpent-like creature, but there was one difference - wings.</p><br><p>Each serpent had only one broad wing like a wyvern, from hide and bones.</p><br><p>The two serpents sought to reach each other, their bodies curving upward, their jaws wide open and their eyes empty, but the center of the gate would not let that happen.</p><br><br><p>The last piece from the third statue crashed into shards, the ice sword flying off to the side, sinking into the water, rapidly lowering its temperature.</p><br><p>Soon, a thin layer of ice appeared on the lake's surface, while freezing wind currents blew toward Adam, causing his cheeks to redden and his breathing to slow.</p><br><p>At the same moment, with a loud crack, the gate moved, releasing a thick, crimson mist.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The shaking grew stronger, like a great earthquake, reaching the outer layers in a matter of seconds.</p>
