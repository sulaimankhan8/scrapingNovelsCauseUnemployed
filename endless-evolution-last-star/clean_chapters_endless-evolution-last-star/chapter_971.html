            <br><p>"What am I supposed to do?" Adam asked, looking up, dissolving into a calm stream of particles.</p><br><p>Heret smiled weakly.</p><br><p>"Nothing serious, at least for starters. You need to release the energy, but slowly and smoothly."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion. "That would allow me to absorb the surrounding energy like a monster?</p><br><p>In response, he shook his head. "Of course not. If Phantoms learned to absorb energy from the environment, then you would be simply invincible. In that case, you should be called monsters, not us. However, despite what I said, you're just as right.</p><br><p>"This will only work here. I'm not talking about the Magma Plateau, but the dark field. This place helped me take one step forward. It's not enough to counter Arnoth in a 1 vs 1 fight, but it's better than nothing."</p><br><p>With a thoughtful look, Adam nodded and moved into action.</p><br><p>Slowly, according to Heret's instructions, he released some energy. A thin white layer covered his body, quietly spreading further.</p><br><p>"Good," Heret nodded deeply. "Keep releasing energy, increasing the affected area. You'll feel it soon enough."</p><br><p>Adam didn't know exactly what Heret was talking about but didn't bother to argue. So far everything was going well.</p><br><p>After a few minutes, when Adam's aura resembled a bright white flame burning in the middle of the darkness, a change occurred.</p><br><p>The tip of the flame touched one tiny crystal, setting off a chain reaction.</p><br><p>The crystals wandering in the fog flashed to form an unusual pattern similar to a constellation in the night sky.</p><br><p>Then, streams of thick energy from the Maga Plateau flowed toward Adam, merging with the white flames.</p><br><p>Through the dark field, Adam's energy attracted tiny crystals that dissolved and, under great pressure, became part of Adam's power.</p><br><p>If Adam were anywhere else, in the Citadel or on the surface, he would not be able to achieve this result regardless of the energy density.</p><br><p>It was possible because of his strength, the extraordinary pressure, the peculiar form of energy in the tiny mist crystals, and the gravity of the dark field.</p><br><p>"Hah... I'm sure a lot of difficult conditions were met to make this possible. This feeling... The energy is close," Adam smiled weakly, closing his eyes.</p><br><p>He found himself in his inner space, where white cracks opened up in the far corners of the darkness. Energy from the real world headed towards him, circling the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>Each of the streams was large enough to swallow Adam whole like a great river, yet it was nothing to the Evolution Tree, just its branches were much larger.</p><br><p>"And... What am I supposed to do next?" Adam waved his hand in a puzzled manner.</p><br><p>[It's simple, you only have two choices...]</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes. "Which are?"</p><br><p>[You're not a monster... I'm not capable of absorbing these currents no matter how hard I try or if you don't want me to...]</p><br><p>This was not news to Adam, though deep inside, he wondered what would happen if he had this ability like all monsters.</p><br><p>[So you'll have to let that energy out... before it damages your inner space... That's the first option...]</p><br><p>After a short pause, the Evolution Tree continued.</p><br><p>[However, thanks to the Crystal Gates, you have another way... Just use this energy as projectiles to weaken the fourth lesser gates...]</p><br><p>Adam turned around, staring intently at the massive gates silently releasing their power, locked one.</p><br><p>"Maybe I should put all my energies at the fifth gate."</p><br><p>[You can... but it's useless....]</p><br><p>"Hmm?" he turned around, confused. "Why?"</p><br><p>[You can't do that... The fifth gate is too strong... Even if you had the energy from absorbing the ten External Artifacts right now, it would barely be enough.]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree gave out a disgruntled wheeze like an old man.</p><br><p>[Focus on the possible task... Like I said... You have a 90% chance if we're given more than two weeks to prepare... You should take advantage of this opportunity...]</p><br><p>"Alright, alright! I get it. Enough of this moralizing. I'll take it one step at a time. Like I always do."</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand, trying to get the energy flowing under control.</p><br><p>He succeeded not immediately, but gradually, the energy moved away from the Evolution Tree and approached Adam like wandering ghosts.</p><br><p>"I won't hide it. I am alarmed by your words that I will only weaken the fourth lesser gates. Most of the work will still have to be done by me, right?" Adam asked, staring intently at the fourth orb.</p><br><p>[Hah... Naturally... Do you think you can only get stronger by absorbing energy? If that were the case, the monsters would have long ago defeated and completely taken over the Dead Lands... They would just need to go to a region with high energy density and evolve quickly...]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree shuddered, staring intently at Adam, who was learning how to control energy flows.</p><br><p>[Energy absorption only allows monsters to reach the limit. To break the barrier, everyone must use their strength... Thanks to the dark field and the Crystal Gates, you are now in a very similar situation...]</p><br><br><p>The first stream of energy crashed into the fourth gate.</p><br><p>There was no change, there was a lot of work to do.</p><br><p>[Go, Adam... If what Vorx and the other serpents said about Arnoth is true... then you will be facing not an equal opponent as the Crimson Monarch was. It will be a monster... both in spirit and power...]</p><br><p>Adam didn't answer anything, continuing to unleash streams of energy on the gates, but the Evolution Tree's words made him frown.</p><br><p>'Tsk. Like, I don't know that. At the Yellow Threat Level, everything happened too fast for me to learn about the top 100 monsters like it was at the Purple Threat Level. The S5 monster that defeated the other S5 monsters, Vorx's queen and king...'</p><br><p>Slowly, a predatory grin covered Adam's face.</p><br><p>'This will be a perfect ending before heading to Wilfred. Even he can't say no to a K4-Phantom, can he?'</p><br><p>Adam didn't notice it, but he was absorbing more and more energy with each passing second, his inner space covered in ruptures.</p><br><p>Heret, watching him, nodded weakly.</p><br><p>'Good. Vorx, it looks like you were right, as always... We actually have a chance to get our castle back.'</p>
