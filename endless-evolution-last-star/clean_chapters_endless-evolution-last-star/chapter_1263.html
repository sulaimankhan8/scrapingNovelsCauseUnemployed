            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1263: Targon, the Crystal Beast (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Fortunately for Adam, he didn’t have to fight Targon, otherwise, it would have been all over for him. The Crystal Beast of the Glass Bridge was not an opponent Adam could stand up to. It was not his level.</p><br><p>However, he didn’t have to fight anyone. Kara and Toa acted as guards, and Targon’s arrival didn’t change that.</p><br><p>However… Adam no longer had the option of simply paying to cross the Glass Bridge. Garrah had warned him about this, although he had mentioned many times that the chances of this happening were slim.</p><br><p>‘Shit, Garrah, you’re smart… Couldn’t you have told me this would happen to me?</p><br><p>Shocked, Adam stared at the massive fist in front of him.</p><br><p>‘Or am I really that unlucky?</p><br><p>Targon smiled broadly. It didn’t matter to him whether Adam was afraid or not; these were his true emotions. After all, Targon couldn’t possibly consider Adam a serious opponent.</p><br><p>“Come on, if you want to go further, you have to go through the trials. I’m sure Garrah should have told you about this.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded as he took a step forward.</p><br><p>“Yes, but what exactly do you want from me? No offense, but you don’t look like some kind of instructor who wants to test whether a fighter can pass the standards. Why are you conducting these trials?”</p><br><p>“Hahaha!” Targon laughed, then a cunning gleam flashed across his eyes. “Haven’t you figured it out yet?”</p><br><p>It was clear from Adam’s expression that he didn’t know Targon’s intentions.</p><br><p>Well, in fact, it was so simple that neither Adam nor Silvana could believe it.</p><br><p>“I just want to have some fun! Hahaha!”</p><br><p>Targon’s laughter echoed for hundreds of meters, shaking the space.</p><br><p>Kara and Toa exchanged glances, their faces showing that they would like Targon, their boss, to take their work more seriously, but they were in no position to argue.</p><br><p>“Adam, you have to understand that sometimes, I have to do nothing more than you live in this world. You just don’t understand what boredom is, because your life is an endless series of chaos and problems, isn’t it?”</p><br><p>“Hmm…” Adam hummed thoughtfully. “Why not try to become stronger and fight against the Lesser Lords? I mean, it’s obvious that you haven’t reached your peak, right?”</p><br><p>Now, Kara and Toa’s views were joined by Silvana. She supported Adam, but she didn’t think it was a good idea to be rude to someone like Targon.</p><br><p>It wasn’t in their best interest.</p><br><p>However, Targon wasn’t angry. On the contrary, he was glad that Adam wasn’t afraid to speak honestly with him.</p><br><p>Kara and Toa did their jobs well, but they were too obedient, and sometimes it even upset Targon that they were willing to carry out any of his orders without question.</p><br><p>“Well, I have work and reasons to stay here, so cocky, even-tempered, and strong young men like you are a rarity.” Targon waved his hand carelessly. “I’m not just talking about Phantoms, but monsters as well.”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>“What about Hybrids?”</p><br><br><p>“Have you ever had to stop a Hybrid?” Adam repeated his question.</p><br><p>He knew that if he wanted to create the Second Grand Star, he would have to fight some kind of Hybrid. He wasn’t sure how it would happen, but it was inevitable.</p><br><p>Without power, he couldn’t stop the World Wipe. That was his goal, more important than any other.</p><br><p>“Hybrid?” Targon scratched his chin. “Yeah, there was one. Hahaha, but I had to let him pass without trials. He had special permission from someone very important. So… it was a curious but brief encounter.”</p><br><p>Adam asked this not only to get an answer to his question, but also to see Targon, Kara, and Toa’s reactions.</p><br><p>‘I see, as Damien said, at this level, the Hybrids are not a secret. However… they are definitely not as common as Phantoms, let alone monsters.’</p><br><p>“Alright!” Targon said vigorously. “Enough talk. I know you need to move on, but I won’t let you pass until you complete my trials. Those are the rules.”</p><br><p>“Hah, and who set those rules?”</p><br><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, gauging the size of Targon’s fist. It was almost as big as Adam’s torso.</p><br><p>“So the first trial is just to punch your fist? And… how many trials do I need to complete before you let me cross the bridge?”</p><br><br><p>“It depends on my mood. You will undergo trials until I have had enough fun. If you can still move after that, no one will stop you.”</p><br><p>The last part made Adam wary, but he didn’t really have a choice.</p><br><br><p>Then, under everyone’s gaze, Adam pulled his arm back, clenching his fist tightly.</p><br><p>Kara and Toa exchanged glances, excited, as did Silvana.</p><br><p>Because of Targon’s character, no one knew what to expect, not even Adam, who seemed to have found common ground with him.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>As Targon said, Adam did not hold back his power.</p><br><p>White energy, with dark clumps in a slow vortex, gathered around his fist, causing the space around it to tremble.</p><br><p>Targon was silent, but his broad smile made it clear that he couldn’t wait for Adam to throw his punch.</p><br><br><p>Adam clenched his teeth, stepped forward, and slammed his fist directly into Targon’s with all his might.</p><br><p>A shockwave of white and black rings radiated from the point of impact, as gusts of wind blew away the tiny crystals covering the Glass Bridge.</p><br><p>Kara and Toa took cover from the violent gusts that could have blown them off the bridge, and even the leaves on the trees in the distance swayed slightly a few seconds later.</p><br><p>Nevertheless… Targon didn’t move an inch, only a shiver ran through his massive body.</p><br><p>“Good. Excellent strike.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded as he looked up, about to say something.</p><br><p>But horror quickly filled his eyes.</p><br><p>“Now it’s my turn!” Targon exclaimed with excitement and a sly grin.</p><br><p>Before Adam could react, a huge fist slammed into him, throwing him hundreds of meters back, to the third of the bridge.</p><br><p>“Hahaha! This is going to be fun!”</p>
