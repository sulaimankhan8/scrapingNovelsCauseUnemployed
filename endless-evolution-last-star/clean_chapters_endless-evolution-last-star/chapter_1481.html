            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1481: House on Top (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Living in a skyscraper had its pros and cons. Obviously, the biggest advantage was that skyscrapers were always located in the heart of cities and business districts.</p><br><p>If a person lived in a skyscraper, everything they needed was nearby, possibly right in the skyscraper where they lived.</p><br><p>The obvious disadvantage was that prices were incredibly high, and they were still apartments, not private homes. For many people, it was important to live in a private home so that they had their own land and their neighbors could not disturb them.</p><br><p>Well, skyscrapers had one option that could alleviate this disadvantage, namely, penthouses. In addition to being special apartments, unique to each skyscraper, they were very spacious and located at the very top.</p><br><p>Thus, a person who lived in a penthouse at the top of a skyscraper basically had no neighbors, neither to the right, nor to the left, nor above, only below. This still could not be compared to a full-fledged private house on the ground, but a private house does not have a view of the entire city as a penthouse does!</p><br><p>In general, skyscrapers, and penthouses in particular, offered convenience, infrastructure, buildings made of the best materials, and incredible views of hundreds of streets and thousands of buildings, for a large, often impossible amount of money.</p><br><p>However, no matter how high the price of an item or property was, there was always a buyer. Sometimes it could take quite a long time, but there were always people willing to buy an apartment at the top of a skyscraper.</p><br><p>Now, it was Adam and Silvana’s turn to become one of those who would close a deal worth tens of millions of credits.</p><br><p>“Hah, come to think of it,” Adam looked around as he followed Silvana and the woman. “The house my family lives in is worth even more than any of the apartments here, right? Although in their neighborhood, money isn’t the deciding factor. You should be able to buy a house there somehow.”</p><br><p>Many people who lived in the same neighborhood as Adam’s family were, in fact, members of the Gamma Division. Sure, it was an elite private area, but the main advantage was that this zone, like the entire First Ring, would not be destroyed in the World Wipe. Everything else would disappear.</p><br><p>“Wow!” Silvana exclaimed as she approached the panoramic windows. “Adam, look at this view!”</p><br><p>Adam stood next to her as his gaze fell on the center of the First Ring. From this height, they could see dozens of streets, hundreds of people, and cars moving along the roads.</p><br><p>The interior of the penthouse was top-notch: marble, glass, steel, wood, and white stone were harmoniously intertwined according to the designer’s concept.</p><br><p>Everything looked clean, spacious, and wealthy. Not every corner was decorated with gold, silver, or precious stones. There was no point in that.</p><br><p>One square meter of this penthouse was worth more than any metal of the same size.</p><br><p>“Yeah, it’s impressive.” Adam nodded deeply. “But let’s see the kitchen, bedroom, and everything else.”</p><br><p>“Ahem. There’s much more than that.” The woman coughed as she tapped her tablet. “In addition to the standard rooms, you may be interested in the large storage room, sauna, swimming pool, terrace with a view of the other side of the city, and much more.”</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana exchanged glances as slight smiles appeared on their faces. It all sounded good enough for both of them.</p><br><p>Silvana came from a wealthier family than Adam, but it wasn’t that Silvana’s parents were rich, as was the case with Louis. It was just that Adam’s family had been at rock bottom until things changed.</p><br><br><p>In about ten minutes, they saw every room, every bathroom, the storage room, the swimming pools, the kitchen, and so on. The number of rooms and halls was too large for just two people, but that was the whole point.</p><br><p>They were going to buy a big house for a lot of money, and in return, they would get a lot of space.</p><br><p>“What do you think?” the woman asked. She didn’t see the sparkle in their eyes and realized they hadn’t made up their minds yet.</p><br><br><p>“Well, you and Silvana worked together on the options, didn’t you? I think it would be a mistake not to see all of them.”</p><br><p>“Great, then follow me. We’re going to the next skyscraper!”</p><br><p>She walked confidently ahead as Adam and Silvana stayed behind.</p><br><br><p>Silvana tugged at Adam’s sleeve.</p><br><p>“If you had to give this house a rating, what would it be?”</p><br><p>“Something out of ten?”</p><br><br><p>“Hmm…” Adam hummed thoughtfully as he looked around one last time, remembering everything they had seen. “Considering that this one costs 25 million credits, I’d say it’s 70 out of 100.”</p><br><p>Silvana smiled faintly.</p><br><p>“Huh, you turned out to be stricter than me. I think more like 60 out of 100.”</p><br><p>“Agh?” Adam was surprised. “Based on your look, I thought your verdict would be much stricter.”</p><br><p>“Well, we’re about to spend a huge amount of money. We have to use the resources we have wisely, don’t we?”</p><br><p>Adam grinned as he threw his arm around Silvana’s shoulder, pulling her close.</p><br><p>“Yeah, I guess you’re right about that. It’s a good thing I don’t even know how much money I have in my account. Hahaha!”</p><br><p>“Pffft, but you know every monster you’ve killed on the battlefield.”</p><br><p>Adam shrugged. “Consider it a professional deformation.”</p><br><br><p>Until evening, Adam and Silvana looked at various penthouses in different skyscrapers. It was an activity that only very wealthy people could afford, but that didn’t mean it was easy.</p><br><p>“Damn!” Adam slumped into a seat in a cafe at the base of one of the skyscrapers. “I’m tired…”</p><br><p>Silvana leaned on the table, her cheek pressed against the surface, as she was completely exhausted.</p><br><p>“Yeah… All these apartments and rooms and halls, they’re all mixed up in my mind. But… Since we rated each penthouse, we now have something to choose from.”</p><br><p>“Shall we do it tomorrow?” Adam opened his eyes in hope.</p><br><br><p>“Of course, I have no strength left. Agh, if it’s so hard for us to choose a home, what will happen when you return to the Dead Lands?”</p><br><p>“Hah, it will be easier, I assure you.”</p>
