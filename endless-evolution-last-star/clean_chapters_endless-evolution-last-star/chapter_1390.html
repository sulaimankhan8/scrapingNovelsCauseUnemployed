            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1390: City…?</strong></p><br><p>With rare exceptions, a Phantom first learned that monsters were capable of speaking only after reaching the K3-Level. If they encountered a strong opponent, this might have happened at the K2-Level, as was the case with Adam and the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>After that, the longer Phantom lived and the more battles he participated in, the more he realized that not all monsters were bloodthirsty beasts who only wanted to kill.</p><br><p>In fact, everything changed in the later stages of the K3-Level, where Phantom began to encounter a large number of the Awakened Monsters, and at the K4-Level, a monster capable of holding a conversation, making a plan, and sharing emotions was not unusual.</p><br><p>Sure, even at the Black Threat Level, many monsters were deprived of these qualities because they were the Dormant Ones and received their power by birthright rather than through multi-stage evolution and battles.</p><br><p>The Elders and Lords became the next stage, as did small factions that, although not as powerful as the Free End, Befallen Crown, and Renegades, had their own leaders, hierarchy, and members.</p><br><br><p>“What…?” Adam’s eyes widened in disbelief. “A city? There’s a real monster city in the world? Like the Citadel or Bastions for humans?”</p><br><p>Norax expected this reaction as he nodded.</p><br><p>“Yeah, does that surprise you?”</p><br><p>“Of course!” Adam exclaimed. “The nests, groups, or factions are one thing, but a fucking city? You’re not kidding me, right?”</p><br><p>“Hah, you think I have nothing better to do?” Norax chuckled. “I understand that this is surprising to you, but think about it from another perspective.”</p><br><br><p>Norax began to explain.</p><br><p>“I’m sure you know that there are far more monsters than humans, especially at very high levels such as the Elder and Lord levels.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded. He knew that the reason was that monsters of such power easily survived the World Wipe. Monsters evolved more easily, and some species and bloodlines could be born immediately at the Black Threat Level. This was their undeniable advantage over humans.</p><br><p>“Obviously, when you have so many monsters that think and act like humans, different groups and factions gradually emerge, but all members of a group have a leader and a common goal or ideology.”</p><br><p>Norax glanced toward the Blighted Scar Lands and continued:</p><br><p>“This works well until there are too many monsters at once. You can’t keep a group or faction under control when there are dozens of different opinions, levels of power, and goals within that faction. Thus, the first cities appeared.”</p><br><p>“Cities?” Adam raised an eyebrow. “You mean there are several?”</p><br><p>“Hah, of course! I mean, you were at the Dark Shore, right? What do you think the main base of the Befallen Crown looks like? Do you think monsters of that power sit in some cave or tower?”</p><br><p>Adam thought about Norax’s words.</p><br><p>A lot had happened at the Dark Shore, but he hadn’t had the opportunity to venture deep into the region, especially where the Befallen Crown ruled.</p><br><p>“Damn, he’s right, right, Silvana?” Adam asked.</p><br><p>“It seems so,” Silvana agreed. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the main base of the Befallen Crown is a huge city, maybe even as big as the Citadel. I don’t know… This is the first I’ve heard of it, but it’s the only logical conclusion.”</p><br><p>Norax leaned back in his chair.</p><br><p>“So, now you know that monsters have cities too. Sure, there aren’t many of them, and each one is different, but it’s not something unique. Although the weaker Phantoms would never believe me. They would think it was nonsense.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam nodded and stared at Norax.</p><br><p>“You said you know a few Hybrids, but they’re too strong for me. And you want me to go to the monster city instead of returning to the Citadel?”</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his neck.</p><br><p>“I can’t say I’m not curious to learn more about it, but it doesn’t sound like a good idea. Especially considering how long I’ve been away from the Citadel.”</p><br><p>“Well, it’s your choice.” Norax spread his arms. “Either return to your base or travel. However, if you go to the city, I can help you with the Dark Heart.”</p><br><p>Before Adam could respond, Norax touched his shoulder as darkness engulfed them.</p><br><p>The next moment, they found themselves on the border of the Black Cut territory and the crimson peaks. Cold gusts of wind swept between them as they hovered high above the ground.</p><br><p>“Look, doesn’t it look enticing?” Norax pointed ahead.</p><br><p>Adam turned as he froze for a moment.</p><br><p>Now, at night, he could see many buildings with sparkling peaks in the distance, as well as streets covered in lights, either from torches or lanterns. The city was too far away for Adam to see anything else, but he knew it was a large, lively city no different from Bastion.</p><br><p>Although… there were two big differences. There were no high walls around the city, and the city was inhabited not by humans but by monsters.</p><br><p>“This is the Blighted Scar City, or Izardo.”</p><br><p>“Izardo? Is that the name of this city?” Adam asked again.</p><br><p>“Yep. It’s the center of the Blighted Scar Lands, one of the regions ruled directly by the Renegades. Part of the Forgotten Mills also falls under their influence, but if there is another faction in a territory, as in our case, it simply cooperates with the Renegades.” Norax explained.</p><br><p>Adam’s fingertips trembled as he clenched his fists. He wanted to visit Izardo, but he believed it was too risky.</p><br><p>“But, Norax, I’m sure visiting Izardo is no problem for you, but what about me? You are a powerful Lord, a monster in the first place, while I am a Phantom!”</p><br><p>The first thing Adam thought was that the monsters of Izardo would attack him as soon as he got too close. The same thing happened with the monster near the Citadel.</p><br><p>“Ah? Are you thinking about that? You don’t have to worry about it. You won’t be the first or the last Phantom at Izardo, there are quite a few of you there.”</p><br><p>This was clearly not the answer Adam was expecting.</p><br>
