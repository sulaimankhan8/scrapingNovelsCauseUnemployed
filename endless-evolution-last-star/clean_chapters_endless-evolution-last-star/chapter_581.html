            <br><p>The fight could start in different ways, slow or fast, the fighters might get into a fierce clutch using all their abilities at once, or on the contrary, they could gradually build up the pace.
</p><br><p>Sometimes, it happened not so rarely, the beginning of the fight would be a few seconds away from its end. If the difference in powers between the fighters was too great, the fight wouldn’t last long, in such situations, one minute was a barrier that not many fighters passed through.
</p><br><p>However, the fighters most often chose Fromund’s option, which was to find out how strong the opponent was by some method.
</p><br><p>Then, there was the next stage, which happened in almost any fight, regardless of whether the battle occurred in the arena or the Dead Lands.
</p><br><p>The fighters would release their auras.
</p><br><p>The reason for this stage was quite simple - if your opponent couldn’t withstand the power of your aura and it was enough to seriously injure him, then victory was close.
</p><br><p>Only if the auras were roughly equal in strength without being able to pierce each other’s defense, then the fight have a chance to be long and spectacular.
</p><br><br><p>If Adam’s aura was white and pure, Fromund’s was a bright, red flame. There was no aggression or anger in his fire, but rather a sense of nobility and desire to strike.
</p><br><p>In the few seconds before Adam’s aura managed to engulf Fromund and cause serious internal damage, Fromund’s Spirit took its form.
</p><br><p>"Wow..." Liv muttered looking at Fromund’s aura.
</p><br><p>She as Elva and Tilda saw it once, they asked Fromund to show it, though he didn’t want to, but under the onslaught of his sisters, he eventually gave in.
</p><br><p>A tall warrior with a bare torso and a menacing stare towered over Fromund. The warrior’s hands were strong, ready to clench into fists that would resemble two steel hammers.
</p><br><p>One massive shoulder pad on his left shoulder was the only thing protecting the warrior’s upper body, along with the active streams of flame.
</p><br><p>Then, a red aura quickly pushed the white flames to the center between Fromund and Adam, showing that neither warrior nor tailor, had the power to bring their owner a quick victory.
</p><br><p>The aura had a vast effect, an effect that the spectators, among whom there were many ordinary people, would feel, especially Elva, Liv, and Tilda who were teenagers.
</p><br><p>But... at the Moon Colosseum, everyone could be safe without fearing the menacing auras of the fighters.
</p><br><p>The reason was not that Kogen, Gladius, or Erik somehow influenced the fight or used their abilities to protect the spectators, although they could do so.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The air shook, at the very edge of the arena, between the fighters and the spectators. But, the shivering stopped in one place, moving exclusively up and down vertically.
</p><br><p>Soon, for a moment, blue transparent walls showed - it was a protective barrier going high up, all the way to the colosseum’s peaks.
</p><br><p>Tilda’s eyes went wide, slowly raising her head in an attempt to see the end of the high barrier.
</p><br><p>"What is that...? Did one of the powerful Phantoms do this?"
</p><br><p>Erik smirked, watching the battle between the two Spirits who still held out hope for one successful attack.
</p><br><p>"No, though your assumption is not without merit."
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, adjusting his hat, Erik added:
</p><br><p>"Deep beneath the Moon Colosseum, hidden is a special External Artifact. It’s one of the main reasons why this arena has its status."
</p><br><p>Just now, Tilda heard things that the Phantoms only learned about after reaching K2-Level, most often after the destruction of the First Wall.
</p><br><p>And, for their Operators, the situation was the same.
</p><br><p>’External Artifact...’ Silvana muttered, her gaze deep, ’Right, in the far parts of the Dead Lands everything is different than in the near zones. The Fume Throne was one of the rare External Artifacts that K1-Phantoms can encounter.’
</p><br><p>Slowly, Silvana shifted her gaze to Adam, whose eyes were full of anticipation for the battle.
</p><br><p>’But... That’s not something you need to worry about right now, right? When you get back to the Dead Lands you’ll see for yourself. The only thing that matters right now is victory.’
</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, his Spirit came into motion raising his hand, holding the long needle tightly.
</p><br><p>Fromund didn’t wait until it was too late and reacted, raising his fists high, fastening them together, his Spirit, the fiery warrior repeated his actions without delay.
</p><br><p>"Hah, I was already prepared to retract my aura, but it looks like you’re not going to give up! Fine, let’s see what’s stronger than my fists or your needle!" Fromund exclaimed with excitement, his legs tensed and the ground cracked.
</p><br><br><p>Two folded fists came down on the long needle, more like a sword, in an attempt to destroy Adam’s Spirit’s only weapon.
</p><br><p>The tailor’s eyes narrowed, deepening, his body arched, lifting the needle above him to keep it from falling to the ground from the force of the warrior’s blow.
</p><br><p>Fists slammed into the needle.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>White and red waves emanating from the impact point spread around like shivers on a calm water surface, soon reaching the transparent walls.
</p><br><p>The spectators sitting in the front seats flinched slightly as the aftermath of the Spirits’ attack descended upon them, but with a blue flash, the barrier absorbed it all, leaving no trace of their auras.
</p><br><br><p>The tailor’s needle was knocked out of his hands, flying aside as the warrior’s fists continued on their way, crashing to the ground in front of the tailor’s deep gaze.
</p><br><p>Both Spirits seemed to lose their weapons. Fromund’s warrior could not make another attack as powerful as that, the warrior needed time to prepare.
</p><br><p>But... unlike the flame warrior, the ghost tailor only used one of his hands.
</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, the tailor appeared in front of the warrior, the amber threads on his left hand shining brightly.
</p><br><p>The warrior’s clumsy body tried to dodge taking a heavy step back, but it was too late.
</p><br><p>The tailor’s palm swept across the warrior’s shoulder like a blade, leaving a deep wound.
</p><br><br><p>A stream of blood rushed outward, but... not from the flaming warrior.
</p><br><br><p>A loud crackle echoed through the arena as the eyes of the spectators dropped lower, from the Spirits to their owners.
</p><br><p>Fromund’s fist slammed into Adam’s face at high speed, blood rushing in two streams.
</p><br><p>The momentum traveled down Fromund’s arm, throwing Adam back several meters.</p>
