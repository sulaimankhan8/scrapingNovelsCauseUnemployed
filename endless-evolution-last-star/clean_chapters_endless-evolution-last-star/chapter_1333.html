            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1333: Fiery Throw into the Clouds</strong></p><br><p>Chapter 1333: Approaching</p><br><p>The battle against Karso turned out to be the most dangerous for Adam, but also the most effective. This was largely influenced by how quickly their battlefield changed from a dark field to more dangerous terrain.</p><br><p>The crimson peaks were an area where Adam had to stay on top, standing on the pillars. Otherwise, he could face threats that neither he nor, more importantly, Karso were prepared for.</p><br><p>Misty, Norax, and Narica were watching them through mirrors and bats, but they were too far away to help them.</p><br><p>However, Adam was able to change his position. He was controlling his threads better every day, and his energy was a significant factor in this improvement.</p><br><p>“Hah, I can feel it, I’m approaching the limit. But, more importantly.” Adam looked down and clenched his fist. “When I crossed the 70% mark, I was already stronger than before the fight with Ureyn, right? And now my strength is only growing, each subsequent percentage is harder to achieve than the previous one, but much more valuable.”</p><br><p>It was true. When Adam’s Energy Axis rebuilt the last 10%, it wouldn’t mean he would become only one-tenth stronger than his current state.</p><br><p>The changes would be much more significant, but Adam still had to get there.</p><br><p>“Tsk, I’m starting to slow down.” Adam frowned as he looked at his Energy Axis. After he threw Karso down to save himself, the pace of their fight slowed down, as did the rebuilding of the Energy Axis.</p><br><p>Adam needed Karso to return so their fight could continue. Only then could he reach 100% and move on.</p><br><p>He had stayed at the Forgotten Mills much longer than he had expected, but he was willing to be patient as long as he saw progress.</p><br><p>‘Hmm, the Desire of Beyond or Dark Heart? Which of these two should I pursue? Well, at least I’ll have to return to the Citadel, otherwise I’ll forget what people look like from spending too much time among monsters.’</p><br><p>Adam didn’t mind Norax’s company. Karso and Misty treated him quite well, as did Narica, although she was colder and more formal because of her work. However, he never forgot that they were monsters and he was a human.</p><br><p>He didn’t know what would happen next, maybe one day they would become enemies because of the World Wipe, or allies?</p><br><p>It all depended on what decision each grand fraction in this world would make, and in many ways, it depended directly on their worldviews.</p><br><p>“The Renegades…” Adam muttered to himself, looking into the distance, seeing the outline of a city in the distance, or at least so it seemed to him.</p><br><p>He narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>‘Monsters can have cities? A society like that at the Forgotten Mills is one thing, but a whole city? No, that’s unlikely. To find out for sure, I have to get closer. I can hardly see anything from such a great distance.’</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A sudden tremor interrupted Adam’s thoughts, reminding him that he was in the middle of a battle and his training.</p><br><p>If he had fallen to the bottom of the crimson peaks, he would most likely not have been able to get out without help. Еhe monsters there would have simply torn him to pieces, but Karso was a different case altogether.</p><br><p>With a bright flash, a pillar of flame shot upward with a deafening explosion as the shockwave shattered dozens of stone pillars around it.</p><br><br><p>A shadow flew through the flames as Karso leaped out, landing on one of the pillars.</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, a crimson rain covered the peaks, drops of blood continuing to fall like hail as pieces of flesh followed, some returning to the bottom, others crashing into the pillars.</p><br><p>“Damn, I didn’t expect you to pull that off.” Karso grinned, brushing the broken claws of some monster off his shoulder. “It was pretty difficult to get out of there with limited power, you know?”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened.</p><br><p>“W-What? You were able to get out of the depths of that mist only with the power of the Elder level?”</p><br><p>Karso smiled broadly and patted his chest. “Of course I am! Did you really think I would have any trouble with that?”</p><br><p>Several red eyes appeared from the depths, giving Adam the creeps, but none of them dared to come out. They knew they didn’t stand a chance against Karso.</p><br><p>Moreover, Misty’s bats constantly emitted a faint aura, reminding the enemy monsters that they were too close to Norax’s Mill and the Black Cut territory to act recklessly.</p><br><p>“So, where are we?” Karso clapped his fists together. “How much do you have left?”</p><br><p>Adam nodded weakly, realizing that it was time to get down to business.</p><br><p>“90% ready, need another 10%. We need to keep fighting, only then will my progress be fast.”</p><br><p>Karso crossed his arms over his chest and nodded deeply several times.</p><br><p>“I see, I have an idea how to make everything go quickly and smoothly, but before that, you’ll have to go through something else.”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam gave a questioning look, but Karso had already taken action.</p><br><p>He appeared right in front of Adam, his fist clenched tightly. All Adam had time to do was block at the last moment so that Karso’s attack wouldn’t tear him apart.</p><br><br><p>The fiery explosion threw Adam high into the air, but that was clearly not enough for Karso’s purpose as he jumped up quickly, catching up with Adam.</p><br><p>“I hope you enjoy the view from above!” Karso exclaimed before spreading his arms wide and clapping his hands together, concentrating all the power of the explosion into a small point.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes reflected a beam of flame that, like a pillar of magma from a raging volcano, threw him high into the air, far above his previous limit, until he crossed the line of clouds.</p><br><p>Windswept gusts buffeted Adam as he recovered from the shock, but he had no time for that, for several figures were already moving toward him, their long beaks and sharp claws outstretched.</p><br><p>They had been waiting for this opportunity since the beginning of the battle, and Karso had given them their chance.</p>
