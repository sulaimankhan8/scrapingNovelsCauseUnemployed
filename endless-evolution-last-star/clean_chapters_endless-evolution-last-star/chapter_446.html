            <br><p>All people like to eat good food.</p><br><p>Those who managed to escape poverty and had some spare money searched for new and unusual tastes, visited expensive restaurants, or bought unique products.</p><br><p>But... all this paled in comparison to what the Dead Lands had to offer to mankind. Countless monsters as a consequence - the unlimited food, in the distant parts, grew strange fruits, and getting them was a real challenge.</p><br><p>However, Adam was already familiar with all of this as he had once been to the Red Feast. The place had strict rules, only the rich and powerful had access to such events, even the Phantoms had to have a certain status to have the right to taste the flesh of a monster.</p><br><p>Continue reading on empire</p><br><p>The Red Feast was one of the main events where many gourmets gathered, but it was not the only place where monster food was served, as the Red Feast was not only a large-scale gourmet event.</p><br><p>The Red Feast was an organization that held a monopoly on the distribution of monster meat and ingredients from the Dead Lands, as well as organizing all events where monster meat was consumed.</p><br><p>The size or importance of the event was not important, it could be the Red Feast - where there were hundreds of people, a few chefs, security, and a proper show for the guests, or something more quiet and simple like Osana's version.</p><br><p>To throw this dinner, she had to ask the Red Feast for help and permission.</p><br><p>They chose a place, discussed the rules and set of ingredients, number of people, time, location, and hundreds of other details.</p><br><p>The administration of the Red Feast approached their work with all strictness and seriousness, as nothing was more important to them than their reputation, which was impeccable and unshakeable.</p><br><p>Sure, most people and even many Phantoms, especially among the newcomers and K0s, didn't even know about the existence of the Red Feast and the monster meat dinners.</p><br><p>But, it didn't matter. The Red Feast worked on quality, not quantity, as their workers and ingredients would not be enough for everyone and that was not something most people needed to know about.</p><br><p>Influential politicians, businessmen, and military men as well as members of the Big Three were clients of the Red Feast, as were the strong Phantoms.</p><br><p>That was enough for the Red Feast to have a powerful influence, especially since the owner of the Red Feast was someone mighty.</p><br><p>"The heart of the Plague Reaper...?" Adam muttered with his eyes wide open. He couldn't believe his ears and eyes, but instinctively he knew that Osana wasn't lying.</p><br><p>Hesitantly, with a slightly trembling hand, Adam lifted the lid of his tray to see the other half of the heart.</p><br><p>It was cooked, a ceramic bowl of red sauce was nearby, and various spices covered the top of the heart.</p><br><p>However, despite all this, the chef managed to preserve the original appearance of the heart, it was natural, strange, and unpleasant to the unprepared eye.</p><br><p>If a teenager or an ordinary person saw it, his face would twist with disgust or he would throw up, not wanting to touch a large heart even with a fork.</p><br><p>But... Adam and Osana felt a strange attraction to this truly unique dish, like the Phantoms and like those who killed the Plague Reaper, which was the reason this heart was here, on this table, and in the Citadel.</p><br><p>"How... and why?" Adam asked looking intently at Osana.</p><br><p>Osana smiled contentedly. She expected Adam to be amazed and his reaction suited her completely.</p><br><p>"Well, I won't hide it, even with our squad killing the Plague Reaper, I had to make a monumental effort and spend hours of negotiation to get the heart of the Plague Reaper."</p><br><p>Osana continued with a slight wave of her hand:</p><br><p>"I didn't want to wear suits and masks as required by the rules of the Red Feast in most cases since then you wouldn't be impressed and in this case, it would be unnecessary."</p><br><br><p>"I see... That's why the waiter left the moment we got here and you had to knock on the door numerous times entering the code."</p><br><p>Adam knew that anonymity was important at the Red Feast, at any of their events. Sure, to some extent anonymity was conditional, as many people knew who was hiding under what alias, but it wasn't known to everyone, only within close circles.</p><br><p>"Yes." Osana smiled.</p><br><p>"Actually, I could get the heart of the Plague Reaper only because of three factors."</p><br><p>Osana pointed three fingers.</p><br><br><p>Adam gave her a questioning look.</p><br><p>"One, we were the ones who killed this Plague Reaper. Secondly, my connections and influence, but I'll talk more about that later. And... the third and most important thing is that you, Adam Vinter, will be here at this dinner."</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, Osana explained.</p><br><p>"Sure, it was Katrin who made the final attack and killed the Plague Reaper, but it's obvious to even ordinary people who have watched the battle footage who made the greatest impact. The administration of the Red Feast realizes that without you, the Plague Reaper would've killed everyone there."</p><br><p>Osana continued, reaching forward and touching Adam's palm.</p><br><p>"You have no idea how many rich and powerful people wanted that heart, but luckily, the Red Feast puts their rules and reputation above all else. Of all the people in this world, you deserve to taste that heart more than anyone else."</p><br><br><p>He hadn't even realized that this dinner had such a complicated and long history as well as preparation.</p><br><p>'The Red Feast... Damn, this is the second time I've run into them and none of their people are even here right now, but I have to admit I like the way they work.'</p><br><p>Then, Adam looked down as his desire to taste the heart of the Plague Reaper peaked, saliva was ready to flow from his mouth.</p><br><p>"So... What do you think? Are you satisfied with this dinner?" Osana asked.</p><br><p>Her words sounded like she was unsure and doubtful, but... her tone was calm and sly, showing that this was all just part of her plan.</p><br><p>However, she had really done a great job of setting up this dinner and getting the main ingredient.</p><br><p>Adam smiled before taking her hand aside and grabbing a knife and fork.</p><br><p>"Sure, my patience is coming to an end. However, I'm curious to know why you're doing all this. You've already spent two of your wishes out of three. Honestly, I expected it to be something more difficult and harsh on me and favorable to you."</p><br><p>Osana chuckled, elegantly covering her mouth with the palm of her hand.</p><br><p>"Perhaps you have the wrong impression of me?" Osana suggested, her eyes narrowing, "Don't forget, I have one more wish left. I assure you, you won't be disappointed."</p><br><br><p>"By the way, you've reached K2 too, right? I can sense it from your aura."</p><br><p>Osana's corners of her lips went up, forming a slight smile.</p><br><p>"Yeah, but I don't think that's important right now. Let's move on to the meal."</p><br><p>Adam nodded before cutting off the first slice, partially dipping it into the sauce, and guiding it to his mouth, taking a much-desired bite.</p>
