            <br><p>Usually, Phantoms and monsters had trouble fighting against the regenerative monster. It was difficult to fight against an opponent who could easily heal any wound.</p><br><p>Sure, the regenerative monsters had enough disadvantages, but regeneration was always a desirable ability. Severe wounds were one of the main causes of defeat, strong regeneration would rid fighters of this problem.</p><br><p>Unfortunately for Rosana, Ivar, and Osmer, Gladius had a lot of experience fighting against the regenerative monsters. He knew better than most what needed to be done to defeat them.</p><br><br><p>Gladius continued to move forward, acting like a wolf in a pen of harmless sheep.</p><br><p>"Who are you?!" Osmer exclaimed as his energy came into motion.</p><br><p>Streams of blood surrounded him, and Ivar, the two Elders, were ready for battle even though they didn't even realize they didn't have a chance in the first place.</p><br><p>"Well, I'm just a friend of a young Phantom you almost killed. It would be bad if that happened, you know?" Gladius chuckled.</p><br><p>He purposely replied, expecting a reaction from one of the monsters, and he got one.</p><br><p>Rosana's eyes went wide in slight fear, showing that it was her.</p><br><p>This was a critical mistake for her.</p><br><br><p>With a shudder, Gladius appeared in front of Rosana, who didn't have time to react to his lightning-fast rush.</p><br><p>"Oh, so it's you," Gladius smirked. "Then you'll be the first."</p><br><br><p>Oddly enough, instead of attacking or causing Rosana multiple wounds so that her regeneration would weaken, Gladius grabbed her by the throat, lifting her off the ground.</p><br><p>Before Rosana could do anything, she saw her delicate skin covered in wrinkles and cracks - Gladius was draining the energy out of her.</p><br><p>"W-What...! Stop...!" Rosana's hoarse old woman's voice broke as she tried to stop him, clutching Gladius by the wrist.</p><br><p>Gladius only licked his lips as he felt a tiny stream of energy heading towards his body. It wasn't even a drop compared to what he possessed, but for Rosana, it was everything.</p><br><br><p>After only a few seconds, Gladius released his grip as Rosana's body crumbled to the ground. Now she looked not like a young girl but like a mummy, dried up and long dead.</p><br><p>The other regenerative monsters watched in horror at how impossible it seemed to them.</p><br><p>The unknown man had just absorbed all the energy from Rosana right before their eyes.</p><br><p>Ivar gasped. The realization came to him, expressing itself in the wild fear in his eyes.</p><br><p>Gradually, everyone realized that the Second Rank Phantom in front of them was the Second Rank Phantom. It wasn't just Gladius's aura that was gradually increasing, but also that he consumed Rosana's energy. Even monsters weren't capable of that with mere contact. They usually had to devour the flesh of another to do this.</p><br><p>"Stop!" Osmer exclaimed, trying to protect the other students. "Just tell us your terms! We're willing to do anything!"</p><br><p>Fighting against Gladius was useless, it was obvious to everyone. Their only way to survive was to negotiate.</p><br><p>Ivar and Osmer were sure that they had something that could interest Gladius.</p><br><p>"I'm sure a great fighter like you wouldn't travel such a long way for revenge against a weak monster! You must have some purpose! We are ready to provide you with one!"</p><br><p>Gladius shook his head, a bitter smile forming on his face.</p><br><p>"You see, to some extent, you are right. I did have a goal - to have fun. But! I'm late, so you will be my stress relief."</p><br><br><p>Gladius stepped forward as a purple pulse dispersed from him. His powerful aura made the legs of the weak monsters tremble. The knees of some of them collapsed to the ground, unable to move or escape.</p><br><p>"Furthermore, one of you attacked a Phantom that might become a Second Rank Phantom in the future. I'm sure you know that the Citadel does not forgive such misbehavior."</p><br><p>Gladius lifted his chin, looking them up and down like worms.</p><br><p>"This is the Dark Shore, guys, a serious game has begun here, so what you see before you is only the consequences of your actions."</p><br><p>Sure, for the most part, it was all just excuses, but there was some truth in Gladius's words.</p><br><p>It was one thing for an ordinary Phantom to go on a mission and get killed. It was nothing new or unusual. The Citadel and the government were long used to daily deaths. Every day, someone died and someone was born. This circle never ended, though... at one point it stopped with serious damage, but always recovered.</p><br><p>But, when monsters from the Dark Shore tried to kill a hopeful Phantom, it was already considered a problem for the entire Citadel and was part of humanity's safety.</p><br><br><p>In a dark flash, Gladius rushed forward, killing regenerative monsters one by one. He didn't use any abilities, just pure physical power and energy.</p><br><p>With every move, fist or kick he made, there was a loud crunch of bones. Blood gushed outward, pouring down Gladius's face and his once-white gloves.</p><br><p>Even though the monsters in front of him could offer him no resistance, Gladius didn't look like he was bored as a sly smirk played across his face.</p><br><br><p>The last monster begged for mercy when Gladius's aura simply turned it into a bloody blur.</p><br><br><p>Gladius took a deep breath, glaring at the dark sky covering the Sacrificial Waterfalls. A lone blood moon was hovering specifically for this region, where there were now no monsters left.</p><br><p>None could escape, Gladius caught those who tried to flee. Their speed was no match.</p><br><p>'Are you feeling better?' Xyrea asked.</p><br><p>Gladius nodded weakly.</p><br><p>"Yeah, but it feels like something is missing. After all, there wasn't even a single Lord among them. Damn, they're much weaker even than those two talentless Barons at the gate!"</p><br><p>Xyrea shrugged. 'Go back home. The Citadel has no business at the Dark Shore right now.'</p><br><p>Gladius was about to reply when something caught his eye.</p><br><p>Deep underground, he felt the aura tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a silhouette floating in the underground lake opened its bright, ruby eyes.</p>
