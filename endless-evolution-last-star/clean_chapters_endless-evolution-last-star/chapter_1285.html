            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1285: White Lie</strong></p><br><p>Everything Adam knew about the Forgotten Mills, Ureyn, and Nollura came from only one person—Gareyna.</p><br><p>Adam was not stupid and tried not to believe every word of people he barely knew, but he did not always have the opportunity to verify the truthfulness of those words. He was in a new and unfamiliar territory with a complex system of factions, and each powerful monster had its own mill.</p><br><p>At the same time, he needed to somehow obtain the Connected Heart in order to ultimately create the Second Grand Star.</p><br><p>Obviously, in this case, he needed help and information. Unfortunately, Silvana no longer had detailed data on each territory, even with increased access.</p><br><p>Thus, Adam believed Gareyna’s words and set off on his journey.</p><br><p>It was hard to blame him for this, because Gareyna did not lie to him about most things. There were three factions at the Forgotten Mills, the Gray Needle members were difficult to reach, and the Black Cut were threatening persons.</p><br><p>However… Adam could not have imagined that the part about Ureyn and Nollura would be completely different from what it was in reality.</p><br><br><p>Clenching her fists tightly, Nollura paced in circles in front of Adam. She was so angry that hot steam was practically coming out of her ears.</p><br><p>“Holy shit! How could you even believe that! Ureyn and I never fought! That bitch… Gareyna she always hated me! That’s why she told you to kill me!”</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head, finding himself in an awkward situation.</p><br><p>“But… Would that have worked? I thought Gareyna’s plan was for Ureyn to see that I had defeated his long-time enemy and become motivated to fight me.”</p><br><p>“YOU IDIOT!” Nollura shouted, pointing at Adam.</p><br><p>Then, her gaze darted to the side.</p><br><p>“You, operator of this fool, show yourself! I know you can do it!”</p><br><p>Adam didn’t need to ask Silvana, she did it herself.</p><br><p>With a slight tremor, she appeared next to him in her spectral form. Her arms were crossed over her chest, and her gaze pierced Nollura.</p><br><p>“And? Why do you need me?”</p><br><br><p>Nollura brushed her hair back.</p><br><p>“Adam, imagine for a moment that you decided to lock yourself in your house for long training sessions and completely cut yourself off from the outside world. You did this to better understand yourself and your powers.”</p><br><p>She looked at Silvana.</p><br><p>“Then, when you least expect it, some monster would come to your door with her severed head in its hand. What would you do at that moment?!”</p><br><p>Silvana was about to say something, but something made her fall silent—as did Nollura. It was as if all the air had been sucked out of them, and they found it difficult to breathe.</p><br><p>A terrifying, dark aura spread from Adam, a black flame that slowly enveloped them first and then spread throughout the nest, causing the spiders to freeze in place in wild fear.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes lost their bright light, momentarily replaced by two spinning abysses that could swallow anything.</p><br><p>“If that happened…” His dark, hoarse voice reached the depths of their souls. “I would have done everything to ensure that this monster met an extremely cruel and painful death as quickly as possible…”</p><br><p>Gradually, the pressure eased and his aura returned to normal, allowing Silvana and Nollura to breathe a sigh of relief.</p><br><p>They clearly hadn’t expected such a reaction from him, but at the same time, they didn’t dare condemn him for it. Both Silvana and Nollura understood that this was exactly how he should have reacted in such a situation. It was what they both wanted, Silvana from Adam, and Nollura and Ureyn.</p><br><p>“Ahem.” Nollura coughed, breaking the tense silence. “So, what do we have here? Gareyna brought you here on purpose because she knew that if you killed me, it would provoke Ureyn’s anger. Obviously, this would force him to leave his mill and come out against you in battle.”</p><br><p>“Yes, but…” Adam gritted his teeth in anger. “He wouldn’t be excited about the battle or motivated to surpass me. Ureyn would be furious, and all he would think about would be how to tear me to pieces.”</p><br><p>Silvana and Nollura exchanged glances as she nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“Hmm, Gareyna… So this kind, sweet woman who offered me tea turned out to be a cunning, treacherous bitch?”</p><br><p>The girls said nothing while Adam clenched his fists nervously.</p><br><p>“Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! That old whore! She wanted to trick me! No, she did trick me! But!”</p><br><br><p>Adam punched a pillar, leaving a deep dent, cracks spreading as splinters flew in all directions.</p><br><p>“She wanted to ruin my fight! I don’t want to fight a mad beast full of rage! I need a worthy opponent!”</p><br><p>The grinding of his teeth was clearly audible to the girls, as they were afraid to say anything.</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam took a deep breath and touched his temple.</p><br><br><p>“Yes?!” She flinched.</p><br><p>“Do you know why Gareyna did that? I mean, it’s unlikely that anything will ease my anger towards her, but apparently, she only lied about you and Ureyn. The three factions, the mills, the neighboring territories and regions, it’s all true, isn’t it?”</p><br><p>Nollura nodded several times in confirmation.</p><br><p>“Hmm, although… about Ureyn. Is it true that he gave up?”</p><br><p>“Gave up?” Nollura touched her lower lip thoughtfully. “Well, I wouldn’t put it that way, I would say that Ureyn realized that the task before him was much more difficult than he initially thought. At first, he was depressed, but then he got over it and decided to put his global plans on hold for later, slowly improving his skills.”</p><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana’s voice rang out.</p><br><p>“Let me guess — Ureyn wants to start actively building up his power after the World Wipe happens, right?”</p><br><p>Nollura spread her arms as if it were obvious.</p><br><p>“Sure. There’s not much energy in the world right now. He and I are protected from the World Wipe, so he decided to gain experience and mastery now to make the most of it in the first few years after the World Wipe.”</p><br><p>“Hahah…” A nervous laugh came from Adam. “So she changed his story too… Damn.”</p><br><p>Then, he glanced at Nollura.</p><br><p>“So, what do we do next?”</p><br><p>In response, she turned toward the northeast.</p><br><p>“Isn’t it obvious? You came for the String Duel, and it looks like the Black Cut has decided to allow it.”</p><br><p>Nollura smiled broadly.</p><br><p>“Then we have to do it! Let’s go straight to Ureyn’s mill!”</p>
