            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1406: Black Fang Troupe</strong></p><br><p>Xander was one of the first to notice what Adam was about to create with his energy. He realized faster than the others that this would be the end for Beatra. Not because she was weaker in the first place, but because, without the judge’s intervention, this attack would have killed Beatra.</p><br><p>Now, he was the one who offered Adam something that might interest him, in theory.</p><br><br><p>Before Adam and Helasa could respond and come to a decision, loud, hurried footsteps sounded from the side.</p><br><p>“Wait! Don’t you dare start without me!”</p><br><p>Erada’s voice echoed through the passageway as she appeared to the left of the calm Xander like a lightning storm.</p><br><p>“What are you discussing? I want to be part of it too!” Erada clenched her fist, staring intently at Adam and Helasa.</p><br><p>“Oh, that’s you.” Adam snapped his fingers. “The annoying kid who was yelling from the stands and distracting everyone else.”</p><br><p>“WHAT!?” Erada frowned as she lunged at Adam. “I’ll show you what I’m capable of, right here and now!”</p><br><br><p>Erada stepped forward, but before she could do anything, something grabbed her from behind.</p><br><br><p>In one swift motion, she crashed to the ground as several strands of her bright blue hair flew before her eyes.</p><br><p>“What the hell are you doing?!” She stared at Xander.</p><br><p>But, instead of answering her, he stepped on her back, preventing her from getting up. He did all this without malice, without any emotion, with a completely calm face.</p><br><p>It seemed that this was not the first time he had to deal with Erada’s excessive activity, and he simply accepted the situation.</p><br><p>“Anyway, as you may have guessed, Erada is also a member of the Black Fang Troupe,” Xander said, continuing to hold his boot firmly on Erada’s back.</p><br><p>She puffed out her cheeks in displeasure and leaned on her elbows. Erada knew she couldn’t get out of this situation until Xander allowed it.</p><br><p>“Tsk. That old man doesn’t know how to treat beautiful girls like me! Just look at him!”</p><br><br><p>Xander pressed down, sinking the heel of his boot deeper into her back.</p><br><p>“What did you say?” Xander’s eyes turned cold as he continued this strange torture. “I’m not as old as you’re trying to make me out to be.”</p><br><p>“Ouch!” Erada yelped, flinching every time Xander’s heel moved. “Fuck! Alright, you’re not that old! Happy?”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Xander looked at the puzzled Adam and Helasa.</p><br><p>He shook his head and sighed heavily.</p><br><p>“My apologies… Sometimes, it’s hard to deal with a demon like Erada. How about we discuss Adam’s goal in a more suitable place? Some tavern or restaurant, of course, I’ll pay.” Xander offered with a light tap on his chest.</p><br><p>Adam and Helasa exchanged glances as they shrugged.</p><br><p>“I don’t mind. But how did you know I was looking for the Hybrids? I mean, I haven’t mentioned it anywhere.”</p><br><p>“Well, you just confirmed it.” Xander waved his hand. “But everyone knows you love to fight. Also, everyone knows that Hybrids live for battle, even more than monsters. If I were you, the first place I would go would be the arena.”</p><br><p>Then, his voice dropped.</p><br><p>“What’s more, until the last attack, you were deliberately prolonging the fight. Beatra, that poor girl, she didn’t even realize it.”</p><br><p>“Hey, you’re talking as if I was letting her win, which is not the case at all. But, yeah, I wanted to attract attention, and since we’re talking now, I’ve achieved my goal.”</p><br><p>“Damn it!” Erada slammed her fist on the floor. “Can we move on or not? I’m tired of lying on the ground like some kind of rug!”</p><br><p>Xander pushed harder. “Quiet while adults are talking.”</p><br><p>“WHAT? Adam is several times younger than me!” She exclaimed.</p><br><p>“Yes, physically he’s younger, but looking at you… Intellectually, the difference between you is even greater.”</p><br><p>“Hahaha.” Adam chuckled. “Alright, I actually agree with Erada. But, were there really only two Hybrids among all the spectators who came to watch my fight?”</p><br><p>“No.” Xander shook his head. “There were at least eight. Some have already left, while others realized that I beat them to it and are waiting for a chance to talk to you afterwards. What about me? Well, I’m just curious what Adam Vinter wants from us, the Hybrids of Izardo.”</p><br><p>Adam smiled. He didn’t know why, but he was sure that with Xander’s help, he would be able to get the Dark Heart. The main thing was to come to a mutually beneficial solution.</p><br><br><p>Thus, twenty minutes later, the four of them were sitting at a large table in one of the restaurants in the central part of Izardo. The prices here were high for most monsters forced to work within the economy of this city, but not for someone like Helasa and Xander.</p><br><p>However, Erada and Adam had recently come into some spare cash that they didn’t mind spending on food.</p><br><p>In Erada’s case, food meant not just a few dishes, but a whole mountain of plates. Her appetite surprised even Adam.</p><br><p>“Damn, Erada doesn’t know what limits are.” Adam thought as he turned his gaze to Xander. “Although… His appetite is impressive, too.”</p><br><p>As before, Xander behaved more modestly, but that couldn’t hide the huge, five-kilogram steak in front of him, which he methodically cut into pieces, dipped in sauce, and ate.</p><br><p>Monsters had a bigger appetite than humans, but the Hybrids took it one step further in that direction.</p><br><p>“So, Adam, since you’ve inevitably attracted the attention of the entire Izardo, which was especially evident from the looks of the passers-by as we walked here, maybe it’s time to tell us why you did all this?” Xander gestured with his knife, not taking his eyes off the steak.</p><br><p>“Yeah!” Erada banged her fist on the table. “Enough with the intrigue. Tell me why you came so I can fight you as soon as possible!”</p><br><p>Helasa smirked as she drank a glass of wine. “You really are a silly child, aren’t you? Haven’t you figured out yet that your question is the answer?”</p><br><br><p>Adam shrugged as he looked at Xander.</p><br><p>“The Dark Heart. That’s why I came.”</p><br><p>Erada’s face paled, and her eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br><p>Xander, in turn, just nodded.</p><br><p>“I see… Now I’m sure we can come up with something. It’s a good start.”</p>
