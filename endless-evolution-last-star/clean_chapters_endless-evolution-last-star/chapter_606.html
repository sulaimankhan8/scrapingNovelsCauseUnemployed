            <br><p>Unlike Adam, Fromund didn't have a helmet when he activated his Power Gene, instead, he had a flaming hoop that was more of an accessory to indicate his status than an element of protection.</p><br><p>Ironically, the flaming hoop protected Fromund from imminent death. He underestimated Adam's new powers. His grip was strong enough to crush Fromund's head, but the flaming hoop broke first.</p><br><br><p>Cracks traveled through the hoop, releasing hot streams of fire.</p><br><br><p>Adam gripped his hand tighter, wanting to achieve his desired goal - to end the fight right now, no matter the cost or what the consequences were.</p><br><br><p>The heat was too much. The first flows of fire appeared from a few cracks, but... when the hoop exploded, the situation went to a whole different level.</p><br><p>The stones submerged in the ground began to melt, soon in less than a few seconds, the molten mass began to bubble, dust-covered in hundreds of embers - bright amber sparks releasing black jets of smoke.</p><br><p>A creature not wielding the same powerful heat was not capable of being near this deadly bonfire.</p><br><br><p>Taking one step back, Adam gritted his teeth as his silhouette shuddered.</p><br><p>To the spectators, he moved several dozen meters backward almost instantly, but the powerful Phantoms saw that it was multiple long leaps at high speed.</p><br><p>Holding onto his head with his only hand, Fromund's eyes distorted as a heartfelt scream erupted from his throat:</p><br><p>"FUCK! HOW IT HURTS! HOW HOT!!!"</p><br><p>At the same moment, all the flames burst out in a single explosion that hurt even the wielder of the flame armor.</p><br><p>All Adam saw was a wave of fire heading toward him, this time the flames were going to consume everything around him, at every part of the arena, there was nowhere to run.</p><br><p>Understanding his situation, Adam did the only thing he could - copy the movement of one of his nemeses, which unlike him has long been resting underground.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>Pressing himself against the wall and holding his sword diagonally in front of him so that his gauntlet would provide protection as well, Adam swung his cape, covering himself with it as best he could.</p><br><p>Silvana watching his movements was surprised, her eyes going wide since the Plague Reaper had done something similar.</p><br><p>'His coat was very different from what Adam has now, but... the principle of defense is the same. However... will it be enough to defend against a wave of flames?'</p><br><p>She didn't have an answer to that question, no one did, and Adam was no exception.</p><br><p>All he could hope was that the flames wouldn't burn him, turn him into a pile of ash, then he'd deal with the rest.</p><br><br><p>The first particles of flame reached his cape, the heat surrounding him intensified with every second, raising the temperature higher.</p><br><p>The ground beside him turned black, the exposed areas of his skin became red, and the air curved like a mirage in the desert.</p><br><p>But, everything had an end.</p><br><br><p>As soon as the flames ended, Adam took a deep breath greedily searching for any particles of oxygen and soon relief came.</p><br><p>All the air inside the arena was burned away, but it took a few seconds for the wind currents rushing in from outside and above to remedy the situation.</p><br><p>Then, with an irritated swing of his sword, Adam looked at Fromund standing off to the side.</p><br><p>A wide burn covered the right side of Fromund's forehead, a few of his hairs were charred, but... it didn't weaken him in the slightest, on the contrary, he grew stronger.</p><br><p>The explosion of the flame hoop filled his armor with power, it absorbed some of the streams, otherwise, Fromund's burns would be much worse even though it was his energy.</p><br><p>His armor became denser, each piece burning brightly with flames as well as half of his spear.</p><br><p>Gathering all his strength, Fromund took a heavy breath and thrust his spear into the ground, raising his arm.</p><br><p>"Adam... I don't know what that creepy power is, but... I can still keep fighting. I can use my powers!"</p><br><p>With those words, high up, above the arena, the first particles of flame appeared - once during their fight Adam saw it.</p><br><br><p>As soon as the portal appeared, a part of the meteorite appeared outside, this was the second time Fromund used his Second Order and the last one.</p><br><br><p>Immediately, dashing through the wind, Adam was in front of Fromund, his sword already bearing right into Fromund's side.</p><br><p>True, Fromund was wearing armor, but he didn't hope it could protect him from Adam's terrifying sword.</p><br><br><p>Using his ability, ignoring the recoil and the trickles of blood flowing from the corners of his mouth, Fromund pulled his spear out of the ground in an attempt to block Adam's attack.</p><br><p>However... he managed to do so at the last moment, in the wrong position.</p><br><p>The sharp blade of the sword slammed into the black hilt of the spear, breaking off the splinter with tremendous force.</p><br><p>The impact traveled through Fromund's body in a powerful pulse, throwing him into the nearest wall, plunging him deep into the concrete blocks.</p><br><p>'Fuck!' Fromund internally exclaimed as he cast his gaze upwards before the rocks blocked his view. Enjoy exclusive content from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Due to Adam not letting him finish and taking away the ability to control his Second Order, the meteorite's trajectory changed dramatically.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Before it reached the ground, the meteorite crashed into the transparent arena barrier, a cascade of blue flashes traveling upward, absorbing the main force of the impact.</p><br><p>Colliding with the indestructible barrier, the meteorite shattered into hundreds of pieces - they rained down on Fromund and Adam like a hailstorm, unable to distinguish who was enemy and who was friend.</p><br><br><p>A few chunks were about to fall directly on Adam, but... as soon as they got close to him, he destroyed them with the opposite edge of his sword.</p><br><p>Each time the right side of his blade collided with a piece of debris, it did not cut but crushed the rock into many shards, taking away its weight and strength.</p><br><p>The falling meteorite was met with cheers from the spectators and... for some, it was a true salvation.</p><br><p>Osana's eyes shone brightly and a wide grin appeared on her face.</p><br><p>'Yes... He did it... Now all that's left to find out is... Will he kill Fromund or let him live?'</p>
