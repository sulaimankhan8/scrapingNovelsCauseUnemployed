            <br><p>In most cases, unless it was some special monster like Plague Reaper or Thunder Demon, Phantoms always had an advantage over their natural enemies - the number of abilities and thus the number of possibilities.</p><br><p>True, quantity didn't mean quality, and not infrequently that was a disadvantage rather than an advantage, but Phantoms rarely had that problem.</p><br><p>A monster might be an unsuitable opponent for a particular Phantom, but its abilities were not useless.</p><br><p>The military might have many pointless weapons in storage that were either unusable or too weak, but with Phantom's arsenal, with the Evolution Tree, this was not the case.</p><br><p>Each of Phantom's abilities had its purpose, and the Evolution Tree also retained variability.</p><br><p>Thus, it was almost impossible to find a Phantom with all of its abilities focused on amplification, healing, or defense.</p><br><p>Phantoms hunted monsters, so they had to have ways to attack and deal damage, at least one or two.</p><br><p>Talna was no exception to this rule, considering what a fiery temper she had it wasn't surprising.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With a violent shudder, the ground cracked in many places, the bumps rising like the growth of young sprouts.</p><br><p>Simultaneously, dozens of bloody roots with sharp spikes sprang out, moving under Talna's control.</p><br><br><p>Talna clenched her fist tightly as the roots curved heading towards the Obsidian Hydra in a powerful rush.</p><br><p>The Obsidian Hydra raised its right paw upward, about to destroy some of the roots with its sharp claws, simply crushing them against the ground.</p><br><br><p>As soon as Talna turned her wrist slightly, the roots moved aside, dodging The Obsidian Hydra's attack.</p><br><p>"Good. I don't know how much it can hold you back, but it won't take her long to seize the opportunity." Talna whispered watching as her roots covered Obsidian Hydra from all sides like tight ropes.</p><br><p>Then, Talna pointed her finger down and the tips of the roots sank into the ground like anchors, setting Obsidian Hydra in one place.</p><br><p>"ROOOOAAAAAAAAARRRR!"</p><br><p>The Obsidian Hydra roared furiously moving its body in different directions and tearing the roots apart with its powerful jaws.</p><br><p>However, that wasn't all Talna was capable of. She could not only make her allies stronger, but she could also fight monsters on her own.</p><br><br><p>Putting two fingers together, Talna made two sharp sweeps of her left hand, forming a cross of crimson energy.</p><br><p>With a cold face, her eyes shone brightly, making the cross filled with dark blood. Then, three more crosses of the same kind appeared beside her. The crosses trembled slightly as they slowly rotated, waiting for orders.</p><br><p>"Let's see what you do now." Talna tilted her arm, launching the bloody crosses directly at the Obsidian Hydra.</p><br><p>One of the hydra's two heads rose, watching the bloody crosses bearing straight towards it through the dense currents of air.</p><br><p>The center head continued to tear the roots apart, but there were too many of them, it would take several minutes for total destruction, while the right head narrowed its violet eyes.</p><br><p>With a bright flash three more crystals on the hydra's chest shone brightly, directing their energy down the long right neck, the intense light was visible through the thick webbed skin.</p><br><p>The Obsidian Hydra opened its jaw wide, unleashing a dense energy laser towards the bloody crosses.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the laser reached the other side of the cave, ripping the bloody crosses apart, leaving only a few dark blobs.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Reaching the wall, the laser caused a deafening explosion illuminating the entire cave for a moment. A violent shudder traveled across the surface, massive rocks rumbling downward, rolling down the slope next to Talna.</p><br><p>She only covered herself with her hand against the dust, feeling her fingertips go numb. As with Abel, this attack cost her a lot of energy, but she achieved her goal.</p><br><p>A sly smirk appeared on Talna's face.</p><br><p>"Hah, you're looking at me, at the bloody roots and crosses, but not where you need to be!"</p><br><p>As if hearing Talna, the Obsidian Hydra's right head glanced down to where Silvana had been a few seconds ago, but... she was already gone.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a wide double blade slid into the hydra's neck, the center head immediately reacted.</p><br><p>Silvana found herself between the hydra's two necks, and her scissors were plunged halfway inside the right one.</p><br><p>"I don't think it's worth using that ability again, as I just might turn your neck into a shredded piece of meat."</p><br><br><p>In an instant, black mist emerged from Silvana's body, heading upwards, stopping at different heights near the hydra's right neck.</p><br><p>The mist split into clots, transforming into four Silvana copies that acted on their own will, following a set target.</p><br><p>Thrust. Thrust. Thrust.</p><br><p>Before Obsidian Hydra could realize or do anything, Silvana, along with her four copies, cut the monster's right neck with their five pairs of scissors.</p><br><p>Pieces of flesh flew off to the sides sending waves of searing pain through Obsidian Hydra's body.</p><br><p>"That's enough." Silvana stepped forward, cutting the last piece from Obsidian Hydra's neck before jumping forward.</p><br><br><p>Under its own weight, the Hydra's right head broke off from its body, falling to the ground with a rumbling crash. On its left neck was a smooth cut, while the right one looked as if some monster with powerful jaws had ripped it off with its sharp teeth.</p><br><p>"Good job!" Abel shouted from the side, but Silvana was in no hurry to relax.</p><br><p>She knew that when monsters were in desperate situations they became the most dangerous.</p><br><p>All the Obsidian Hydra had left was six crystals, a central round one, and one head.</p><br><p>Silvana, Talna, and Abel also used up a lot of abilities, but they were clearly in a better position than Obsidian Hydra.</p><br><p>Then, Obsidian Hydra decided to use her last trump card which could lead to an unknown result.</p><br><p>Continue your adventure at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The central round crystal shone brightly, releasing streams of purple energy that connected with every crystal around it.</p><br><p>Silvana and the others sensed that Obsidian Hydra wanted to use the energy to blast them off, their experience telling them.</p><br><p>"Hurry up! We need to get together!" Abel exclaimed before rushing towards Silvana.</p><br><p>Talna didn't hesitate and within seconds she was behind Silvana and Abel was in front of them going to protect them with his shield.</p><br><p>"Don't worry, even if I get hurt badly, I'll stay put until the end! I will regenerate my shield for as long as necessary!" Abel exclaimed bravely.</p><br><p>Gradually, the flash from the crystal grew brighter, reflecting in Silvana's wide-open eyes.</p><br><p>Then, she realized something that previously escaped her gaze.</p><br><p>"No... This explosion won't do any real damage... It's something else..." Silvana muttered.</p><br><p>Then, Obsidian Hydra finished storing energy, releasing it all at once through its main crystal.</p><br><p>A purple flash traveled throughout the cave for a moment blinding Silvana, Talna, and Abel, they had to close their eyes.</p><br><p>After a second, Silvana blinked, bafflement came over her since Abel wasn't standing in front of her.</p><br><p>"Talna, what the hell is going on here...?" Silvana turned around over her shoulder as horror filled her face.</p><br><p>Instead of Talna, behind her stood Adam, who was just as shocked as she was and also terrified, his legs shaking from Obsidian Hydra's powerful aura.</p>
