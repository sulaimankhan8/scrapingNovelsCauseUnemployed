            <br><p>Adam's power gene after evolution was always one of his main trump cards. This ability required a lot of strength and energy from him, but in return, it provided pure destructive power.</p><br><p>What else could Adam dream of when he needed to defeat a powerful enemy?</p><br><p>Moreover, by using his wreath, Adam made this attack even stronger. Considering that Kreyna had dodged his dark blade, he was sure that this attack would kill her in an instant.</p><br><p>Yet... it wasn't enough to bring Arnoth down.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Adam's right hand trembled as he grabbed his wrists. Thanks to the energy and the four open gates, he was strong enough not to take serious damage.</p><br><p>He couldn't make the same mistake as at the Fortress of Lone Serpent again. That day, he protected the Phantoms and himself from the Crimson Monarch's attack, but by that action, he almost lost the battle.</p><br><p>If not for Silvana and her new ability that allowed her to take Adam's wound on herself, he never would have defeated the Crimson Monarch with such a wound.</p><br><p>But, even though Adam had finally managed to damage Arnoth's shield, and his arm wasn't badly hurt, there was no joy on his face.</p><br><p>"What the fuck..." Adam uttered, staring at the amber crystal in the center of the shield.</p><br><br><p>'Shit, the core in that huge knight's chest was several times smaller! That said, once Heret and I destroyed it, that knight was finished!'</p><br><br><p>Arnoth raised his shield, hitting the ground several times. Not too hard, he wanted to drop the remaining scraps, but with each strike, a shockwave traveled through the throne room.</p><br><p>The light from the core was as bright as the sun, gradually accumulating around the crystal.</p><br><p>'Damn, so that's what its power is?' Adam gulped, shocked. 'In that case, I should destroy his shield! I don't even want to think about how much power, how much energy he's constantly getting from that core!'</p><br><p>After a long silence, Arnoth slowly looked at Adam.</p><br><p>''Good hit, now... I'm sure again that you can kill me. Hah, now I think out of the two of us I'm the real lucky one."</p><br><p>Adam became wary as he took a step back. "Hmm? What do you mean?"</p><br><p>"Well, earlier I said you needed a few years, but no... Considering how young you are. If you'd come five, no... three months later, I'd have a major challenge against you."</p><br><p>"Tsk. You make it sound like I don't stand a chance."</p><br><br><p>Arnoth slammed his sword against the ground, in a single strike shattering the top layer hiding another amber crystal lurking in the hilt, just under the beginning of the blade.</p><br><p>That one was not as large as the one in the shield, but definitely much brighter.</p><br><p>'Fuck, another one and despite the difference in size, both crystals have roughly the same amount of energy in them - it is tremendous.'</p><br><p>"You have to understand, Adam, that you just made me show what was hiding underneath the shield and sword. Those crystals make me stronger, and now that you've revealed them, the effectiveness has peaked. There's nothing else stopping the energy from being channeled directly into my body."</p><br><br><p>"W-Wait...! You mean that..!"</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Arnoth's aura abruptly became several times stronger. Golden streams of energy traveled down both of his arms, condensing at his chest and shoulders.</p><br><p>"Agh..." he sighed gravely, as if heavy chains fell from his body. "I won't say I'm going to show you my true powers now, that would be ridiculous. But, my access to power has actually become, freer."</p><br><br><p>Arnoth swung his sword as Adam's pupils narrowed. A shiver ran through his body, causing him to bounce to the side.</p><br><p>The golden blade swept to his right, leaving a wide cleave on the ground.</p><br><p>"You know. I can go on like this for a long time. I don't need cunning tricks or complicated abilities to defeat you. I can conquer you simply by the fact that I'm stronger!"</p><br><p>Three flashes reflected in Adam's eyes as energy covered his legs.</p><br><p>Once again, he had to dodge Arnoth's seemingly endless attacks.</p><br><p>The worst part was that Adam realized that Arnoth was right.</p><br><p>'Shit, he sure has more energy than me. Sooner or later, I'll get tired of running, at one point I'll make a mistake, then another, and another. At the same time, he'll keep attacking!'</p><br><p>Adam turned around, swinging his first needle to reflect the golden blade.</p><br><p>'I'm not fighting against a crusader, I'm fighting against a fucking turret!'</p><br><p>Soon, he heard Silvana's calm voice.</p><br><p>'You need to figure something out. Your Nexus. You still haven't utilized the power of the rings. It's pretty much the only thing you have left, Adam.'</p><br><p>'Yeah, I know that,' Adam said as he shifted forward to dodge another blade. 'But I don't think I want to try to destroy his shield or sword. It was stupid, I didn't know what was underneath the protective plates.'</p><br><p>'So... What are you going to do?'</p><br><p>A slight smirk covered Adam's face before quickly disappearing, returning his serious expression.</p><br><p>"As always, try to break through the armor!"</p><br><br><p>Adam turned around sharply, tearing straight at Arnoth. Golden blades whizzed by him, leaving cuts, but he was ready for it.</p><br><p>'His armor is not like other monsters from the Light Legion. There are no gaps or weak spots. But, even so, somewhere his armor is thinner, right?' he thought as a purple wave of energy passed through his body.</p><br><br><p>Despite Arnoth's endless attacks, Adam was able to get dangerously close to his great enemy.</p><br><p>Arnoth stopped as he was ready to put up his shield for defense. He knew what Adam planned to do. Dozens of opponents before Adam had tried to break through his armor as well, but hardly anyone succeeded.</p><br><br><p>However, instead of attacking with the needle, Adam stopped and made many swings with his left arm.</p><br><p>Each one resonated with pain on his face, and Arnoth couldn't understand why.</p><br><p>Then, he saw a multitude of white lines soar through the air, the purple pulses traveling along the edges.</p><br><p>A hail of blades, capable of passing through anything similar to Adam's path, rained down on Arnoth.</p>
