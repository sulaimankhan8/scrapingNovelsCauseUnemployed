            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1371: Five Rings and the green eyes</strong></p><br><p>Five rings and chains.</p><br><p>It was the most unusual shape Adam’s Nexus had taken so far. Although he had received his new Nexus at the very beginning of the K4 Level, he had not yet used the full power of this weapon.</p><br><p>The last time he did so was against Bathild. If it weren’t for the abilities of the third and fourth rings, Adam would most likely have lost or, at best, suffered a series of serious wounds.</p><br><p>This had always been his trump card. If even the Dual Demon Sword didn’t work against his opponent, it meant he needed reinforcement.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver couldn’t see the future, he didn’t know what Adam would decide to do, nor did he know what would happen next.</p><br><p>The fifth ring was also the last one, making it a special one.</p><br><p>A bright crimson light covered the tar lake as a tremor ran through all the rings.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With the active trembling, the runes on the other rings glowed brightly, as energy in streams went up and down until the chains could no longer withstand the pressure.</p><br><p>The chains broke as the five rings soared in front of Adam.</p><br><p>The first and second rings headed for his feet, ending up closed around his ankles. The third and fourth rings stopped at his wrists.</p><br><p>The fifth ring remained hovering before Adam’s calm but sorrowful eyes.</p><br><p>Under his gaze, cracks appeared on the ring until it split into two parts, heading toward his shoulders to protect him like the armor of the crimson knight.</p><br><p>When all the rings were in place, the runes glowed once more, releasing the red threads that, like chains before, served one purpose: to connect all the rings together.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver’s green eyes watched intently as the red threads ran through Adam’s body, filling him with strength.</p><br><p>Only after a few seconds did the last thread find its place.</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam raised his hand as his fingertips twitched, clenching into a fist.</p><br><p>“This power… It will cost me a lot. Perhaps even more than I can pay. Silvana, what do you think? Will this be enough?”</p><br><p>Her voice came back a moment later.</p><br><p>“Unfortunately, I cannot know that, but I am sure we will fight together. Use as much of my energy as you need.”</p><br><br><p>“Thank you. Without you, this power would have already broken my bones…”</p><br><p>Then, his gaze returned to the Silver Weaver, who, unlike Adam, covered in tar, was not a speck of dust.</p><br><p>“I am coming, my old enemy.”</p><br><br><p>A shiver ran through Adam’s frame as he disappeared from the Silver Weaver’s field of vision.</p><br><p>Only thanks to his instincts did the Silver Weaver sense Adam’s presence on his right.</p><br><p>But when the Silver Weaver’s eyes shifted, it was already too late.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s fist slammed straight into the Silver Weaver’s shoulder as the red threads burst out, accumulating all their energy in one point.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver’s pupils narrowed in horror as he watched the trembling crimson orb, the size of a seed but possessing terrifying power.</p><br><p>“Now, it’s my turn to win. At any cost, just like before.” Adam’s calm voice rang out as he watched the crimson orb unfold.</p><br><br><p>The explosion of scarlet flame threw the Silver Weaver aside, as the monster’s sturdy body crashed straight into the container, making a deep dent in it.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the Silver Weaver opened his eyes as Adam’s fist was already in front of him.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver didn’t care about the open, bleeding wound on his shoulder. Now, he had to find a way to survive and stop Adam.</p><br><p>“GRHA!” The Silver Weaver growled, lunging at Adam.</p><br><p>His head slammed into Adam’s stomach, while the silver threads supported his paws, ultimately allowing him to regain control of the situation.</p><br><p>“RGHA!” Adam spat a mouthful of blood as the Silver Weaver slammed him to the ground.</p><br><br><p>A cascade of threads shot upward, sparkling in the darkness, before raining down on Adam, who noticed it at the last moment.</p><br><p>‘No, I can’t lose now! He knocked me to the ground? I’ll do the same! I’ll kill him right now, with one powerful attack!’ Adam roared internally as his legs trembled.</p><br><p>With the speed of sound, he disappeared as the threads whizzed past his back.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s knee slammed into the Silver Weaver’s head, momentarily disorienting him.</p><br><p>Then, grabbing the Silver Weaver’s thick neck, digging his fingers into his dense fur, Adam put all his strength into one move.</p><br><p>“SHIT! Move!” Adam gritted his teeth before lifting the Silver Weaver above him and slamming the monster, which weighed dozens of times more than him, to the ground.</p><br><br><p>A pillar of dust rose as the Silver Weaver’s back hit the surface. The throw created a crater near the tar lake as Adam towered over the white beast in the middle of it.</p><br><p>Pulling his fist back for a punch, Adam focused all his energy on a single point.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Space trembled as the crimson vortex swirled around his fist like an unstable star ready to destroy anyone in its path.</p><br><p>This explosion would be devastating not only for the Silver Weaver but for Adam himself. He knew that avoiding serious injury was impossible.</p><br><p>‘I don’t care, just like then! I took that spear and killed him! Now, I’ll do the same!’</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam brought his fist down as the flames in his eyes burned brightly.</p><br><p>He saw the Silver Weaver’s fur tremble as his eyes widened in terror. One explosion, one precise strike, and their battle would be over.</p><br><p>“Victory will be mine!”</p><br><p>A bright flash lit up the battlefield as something reflected in Adam’s eyes for a moment.</p><br><p>‘Wait… Is that… a needle?’</p><br><p>Faster than his thoughts, something touched him as his explosion was cut in two before it could begin.</p><br><p>The impact threw Adam to the side as he hit the ground several times.</p><br><p>With difficulty, he got up from the ground, holding himself up with his hands, only to have his eyes widen in disbelief.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver was gone, or rather, the massive, white beast that he was.</p><br><br><p>Two legs stood firmly on the cold sand while streams of dust hid the frame, leaving only two calm green eyes with round pupils visible.</p>
