            <h4>Chapter 1068: Attentive One (Part 1)</h4><br><br><p>Adam had never been in a situation like this before. He couldn’t hide his inner tension as all the wing monsters stared at him intently as the main enemy.
</p><br><p>’Did you hear what he said?’ Silvana’s voice boomed in Adam’s mind.
</p><br><p>’Yeah... As always with his kind, he’s up to something. Perhaps going down into that gorge would be my best idea.
</p><br><p>Unlike Rosana, Osmer, Saegar, and Kenward, Adam was unaware that three Earls were heading for the Soaring Chain Islands. He didn’t know that there were any differences between the Lords at all, and like most assumed that all Lords were equal.
</p><br><p>"Khm." Saegar coughed. "I think you realize that if I start the trial right now, you’ll just pounce on Adam, grab him, and make him show you the way to the Twilight Crystal, then you’ll kill him. Then there would be no point in the trial, I hope you understand."
</p><br><p>Then, Saegar’s corners of her lips curved upward.
</p><br><p>"Which is why Adam will have exactly five minutes to get as far away from you as possible and choose a vantage point."
</p><br><p>Licking his lips, Saegar looked at Adam.
</p><br><p>"Kid, beware, there are more than just monsters of my kind on my land. Deep in the gorge, you may encounter monsters that live deep underground and pass between the territories of many Lords. So... When you find yourself in a dark, safe corner, always look back to be sure."
</p><br><br><p>It didn’t matter that globally, the Phantoms and the monsters were enemies. Right now, he was one of the participants in the wing trial, and Saegar gave him good advice.
</p><br><p>"Alright!" Saegar clapped his hands together. "Five minutes start right now!"
</p><br><br><p>Without a moment’s hesitation, Adam jumped down.
</p><br><p>He knew where he needed to go thanks to the dark route, but he didn’t go straight down that path.
</p><br><p>So far, twenty wing monsters were watching him closely, trying to figure out where he would end up after five very long minutes.
</p><br><p>No one risked moving or disobeying Saegar’s orders. He wouldn’t have to do anything if anyone broke his word, Valdris would kill the disobedient monster immediately.
</p><br><br><p>Adam hopped like a shadow from one slope to another, gradually disappearing into the depths at about the spot where he had originally been.
</p><br><p>Then, when the bulging rock hid his silhouette, he disappeared completely, leaving no chance for the wing monsters to track his movements.
</p><br><p>Could Adam reach the Twilight Crystal in five minutes and finish his journey at the Dark Shore faster than his time was up?
</p><br><p>No, that was out of the question.
</p><br><p>The process of returning would not be that quick. After all, even absorbing the Twilight Crystal would take Adam quite a long time.
</p><br><p>Saegar glanced at his watch from time to time, an exquisite piece of work. It was unclear where it had been made, at the Dark Shore by monsters like him and Kenward, or... had Seagar gotten this watch from humans?
</p><br><p>It’s one thing to learn how to make wine with grapes on your land and quite another to make such a complex mechanism as a watch.
</p><br><p>The young monsters’ patience was growing thin by the second, but they waited. They knew that the Phantom, Adam, was getting farther away from them. However, some of the twenty were not worried, there was nothing but a slight coldness and confidence on their faces.
</p><br><p>Valdris glanced nervously at Saegar. He was Saegar’s right-hand man for decades, and he understood that Saegar was not waiting for the end of five minutes, but for the enemy Lords to arrive.
</p><br><p>Unfortunately, there was no place for Valdris in such a fight. There needed to be at least three monsters like him to face one Baron, and the Baron would still have a better chance of winning.
</p><br><p>"Alright, five minutes are up, you can go."
</p><br><br><p>With the speed of the wind, the young monsters tore down, slightly revealing their great, dark wings to dive down like hawks.
</p><br><p>Saegar was about to head back to the main island. He had a few things to discuss with Kenward, like one Lord with another, but something caught the corner of his eye.
</p><br><p>One girl with long black hair and blue eyes, almost human, remained standing at the edge. She was not looking at her fellows but at Saegar.
</p><br><p>"Hmm? Lexa, is there something you want to ask me?"
</p><br><p>Saegar knew the name of every monster who was under his command. He believed that it was important. Moreover, he didn’t own an army of tens of thousands of warriors, it was within his capabilities.
</p><br><p>"Yes. I wanted to ask something. Did they do everything by the book?" Lexa pointed to the others.
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a wide grin covered Saegar’s face.
</p><br><p>"Oh, so you noticed?"
</p><br><p>Lexa nodded. "Sure. It’s only been three minutes and thirty seconds. Frankly, I’m surprised the others didn’t count to themselves."
</p><br><p>"Well, maybe they knew but decided to take advantage of the fact that I was in a hurry. Hahaha, fine, since you’re such a good girl, I’ll give you some advice. Consider it a bonus since you’ll have to catch up with the others."
</p><br><p>"Khm? Advice?" Lexa tilted her head in a confused way.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, one very good piece of advice."
</p><br><br><p>Before Lexa knew it, Saegar was in front of her, it only took him one step to shorten the distance.
</p><br><p>"That Phantom... You should be more careful with him. You may be one of the top twenty, but... Do you have any idea how many K3-Phantoms were summoned at the Dark Shore by the First Star itself?"
</p><br><p>Without emotion, Lexa looked up.
</p><br><p>"Considering your long introduction, not very many."
</p><br><p>"Hah, that’s putting it mildly. Just don’t die, it would actually hurt me to lose you."
</p><br><br><p>"Thank you... I guess?"
</p><br><p>Saegar shook his head with a bitter smile before disappearing. The three Earls were close behind.
</p><br><p>Their speed could only be matched by one human who wanted to take part in the show. He already made it through the gate and ran as fast as he could.</p>
