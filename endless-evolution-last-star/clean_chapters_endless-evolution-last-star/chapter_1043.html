            <h4>Chapter 1043: Rosana (Part 2)</h4><br><p>What was originally supposed to be a simple quick trip together took an unexpected turn of events and most importantly, split up.
</p><br><p>Risha, Vorx, and Heret were on one side of the lake while Adam and Rosana fought on the opposite side.
</p><br><p>In fact, for Risha, Vorx, and Heret it was no big deal. Working together and fighting as a cohesive unit. It was easy for them as Risha trained with them and with Torz and Grita.
</p><br><p>But Heret couldn’t shake the feeling eating him up inside.
</p><br><p>’It shouldn’t be like this,’ he thought, turning into a green flash as he ended up tearing a chunk of flesh off the Blood Crusher’s shoulder.
</p><br><p>His eyes traveled to the side, looking at Adam and Rosana, who were connected by two threads. Then, energy, like white fire, ignited on Adam’s fist.
</p><br><p>’Something’s not right. Why is this monster even here? Why is she alone?’
</p><br><p>It seemed that Heret was the only one who realized that Rosana didn’t belong in the blood pond despite her similar abilities. It wasn’t just her appearance, but her behavior as well.
</p><br><p>’Shit, it doesn’t matter now. Adam will defeat her anyway. She can’t be stronger than Arnoth, that’s for sure. After this, everything will be clear!’
</p><br><p>Then, the three of them continued to attack the Blood Crushers and the Voracious Beasts, trying to help the two giants.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam’s frame appeared in front of Rosana, who didn’t have time to react. Even though she accepted the challenge to fight, she still showed indifference towards him. She was sure that the absence of one arm would greatly affect his fighting potential.
</p><br><br><p>With a shudder running throughout the blood pond, Adam’s fist plunged into Rosana’s stomach.
</p><br><p>Pain was the least of Rosana’s worries at that moment. As the possessor of powerful regenerative abilities, she had long since gotten used to pain. If need be she could ignore it.
</p><br><p>The force of Adam’s blow was beyond her expectations. It wasn’t just painful, it was devastating.
</p><br><p>In a split second, her bones and torn flesh were exposed.
</p><br><br><p>Jaws snapped shut, disappearing as Rosana channeled all her energy directly into her regeneration.
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes went wide, watching as streams of blood rushed to his left and right like two great rivers. Rosana was regenerating her stomach at the same rate as Adam’s energy was destroying it.
</p><br><p>It wasn’t the most pleasant scene from the side, as if someone set up a meat grinder in Rosana and she was actively using it to discard the damaged flesh and replace it with whole flesh.
</p><br><p>"Holy shit!" Adam exclaimed in excitement as blood flooded his face. "This is a whole other level!"
</p><br><p>Rosana gritted her teeth, reaching out to Adam with her hand. Blood ran down her forearm, filling with jaws.
</p><br><p>The problem wasn’t the pain, it was how much energy Rosana was expending. She couldn’t let it continue at this pace.
</p><br><p>"You bastard! Don’t you dare underestimate me!"
</p><br><p>Jaws came down on Adam as he jumped back, causing Rosana’s attack to crash into the ground.
</p><br><p>The dust immediately dispersed, revealing Rosana’s completely intact body. There wasn’t a scratch or bruise on her skin.
</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."
</p><br><p>But her heavy breathing gave away that this was not the best start to the fight for her.
</p><br><p>Adam shrugged, slowly surrounding her.
</p><br><p>"Well, that’s to be expected. I don’t know what you’re doing here, Rosana... but you had the misfortune of running into me."
</p><br><br><br><p>"You’re being too arrogant. All you’ve achieved is that I’ve expended some energy!"
</p><br><br><p>Adam didn’t answer anything. His expression changed dramatically, filling with coldness.
</p><br><p>"Wake up. You have a name, but no title. Standing before you is someone who defeated monsters with unique, real titles. You’re not an opponent equal to them, you’re just a necessary step to power.
</p><br><br><br><p>"What else would you expect from a New Wave monster, right?"
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>For some reason, it was Adam’s last words that made Rosana’s face contort into a ghastly grimace.
</p><br><p>"You... Don’t you dare address me like that, you piece of shit!"
</p><br><p>Her howl rippled across the blood pond, but it barely had any effect on Adam.
</p><br><br><p>Like a maddened beast, Rosana sprang from her seat. Blood turned into paws full of hungry jaws, casting a shadow over the calmly standing Adam.
</p><br><p>A multitude of sharp fangs sank into Adam’s flesh, causing blood to trickle out. Rosana gritted her teeth in anger and lunged forward with Adam, plunging into the lake.
</p><br><p>Strangely, Adam didn’t resist, he only watched her intently.
</p><br><p>The vivid pain could not distract him from his thoughts.
</p><br><p>He saw that look on her face a few times. Rosana’s eyes were full of not only anger and rage, but also resentment and a desire to prove that she was better than the others.
</p><br><p>Somewhat, very distantly, she reminded him of Risha, Katrin, and Osana. All three of them were pretty strong, but not strong enough to be at their desired peak. That was very different from someone like Fromund, Reinz, or even Tron.
</p><br><p>’Hmm... So, she knows that she’s not just a monster but that she’s a New Wave monster. What made you become such a violent beast at the snap of a finger?’
</p><br><p>Rosana drew her hand back, fangs along with blood headed to one point, forming a great lance to blow a hole in Adam and end his life right there.
</p><br><p>But, it was more important to her to win than Adam’s death.
</p><br><p>’Hah...’ Adam smiled bitterly, he realized what was going on. ’What happens when you combine the traditions of monsters, their respect for strength and the ideals of human society?’
</p><br><br><p>’All you get is millions of forever broken souls and...’
</p><br><p>Adam didn’t finish as his eyes caught a bright red glow.
</p><br><p>They were practically submerged at the bottom of a scarlet lake. A multitude of crystal shells surrounded them, just like the ones at the bottom of the well.
</p><br><p>Adam needed four blood essences to create a shape for the Third Key and heal his arm.
</p><br><p>He could see at least six beside him, there was no telling how many more were lurking underground.
</p><br><p>’This is what I need.’</p>
