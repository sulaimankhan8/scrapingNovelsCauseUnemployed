            <br><p>A light flame appeared amidst the darkness, slowly striving towards the snow-white seed floating in the void.</p><br><p>Without resistance, the seed absorbed its portion of energy, without the knowledge of its owner beginning a rapid growth.</p><br><p>In a few seconds, the seed became a powerful sprout, but there was no bark or other attributes of a future great tree. Its structure was more like a flower, bursting into flames from its thin roots, but without completion.</p><br><p>The flower had no bud, only trembling fibers and brightly burning flames in no hurry to take any form, it was too early.</p><br><p>The heat increased, growing stronger and stronger until finally, it became a scalding heat.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes opened as she surged up sharply, snapping out of a deep sleep.</p><br><p>She looked around, seeing white walls, several screens, and familiar medical equipment.</p><br><p>Then, her head turned to the left, looking at her hand with fear and curiosity.</p><br><p>In a way, she was lucky earlier that she immediately passed out from Adam's wound, so she didn't feel the searing pain.</p><br><p>Her eyes went wide, though the sight wasn't horrible, her arm was far from fully recovered.</p><br><p>Wide bandages covered the most troublesome areas, multiple stitches held the flesh together, the rips were covered in a thick white substance, something between ointment and viscous glue.</p><br><p>Not even a fraction of the original pain remained, yet Silvana felt an unpleasant burning sensation, the pain gone incompletely.</p><br><br><p>The door to her room opened as a woman with long black hair stepped inside, her look stern and experience evident in her gaze.</p><br><p>"Finally awake?" the woman asked nonchalantly, checking Silvana's status on the tablet in her right hand.</p><br><p>With slight confusion Silvana nodded, rubbing her shoulder.</p><br><p>"Yes... How did I end up here?"</p><br><p>"Doesn't you understand that? You were brought here by the military personnel. Your connection to Adam Vinter was abruptly cut off. That was enough for a squad to move in your direction."</p><br><p>The woman waved her hand, looking at the confused girl.</p><br><p>"They had many assumptions about what might have happened to you, but..." her gaze lingered on Silvana's hand, "No one dared suggest that this happened."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes sparkled. The woman's tone showed her that the doctor knew far more about her situation than she did.</p><br><p>"Do you know what it was?"</p><br><p>"Sure, that information is available to me, though I'll admit honestly, I didn't expect to have to treat the Operator of the K2-Phantom from Pain Transition in the middle of the night."</p><br><p>Silvana blinked several times, puzzled. Even though in their pairing with Adam she was the one who knew more, she had never heard of it.</p><br><p>"Pain Transition...? Is that what I did? Is it something special?"</p><br><p>She didn't know what answer she wanted to hear. All Silvana wanted was to be useful to keep up with Adam.</p><br><p>"Well, it depends," the woman shrugged and walked over to Silvana examining her with her tenacious gaze.</p><br><br><p>The woman squeezed Silvana's arm not far from the previously injured muscles.</p><br><p>"Ouch!" Silvana shrieked in pain without expecting it herself.</p><br><br><p>The woman nodded deeply as she continued to examine her patient.</p><br><p>"I don't know what Adam Vinter did, but without putting you to sleep for a few days I can't cure something like this in one go. You'll have to go through a few more sessions and you'll be fine."</p><br><br><p>"I've seen a lot in my career, this job forces you to look at the worst wounds, but it's one thing to see them on Phantoms and quite another on Operators."</p><br><p>Suddenly, the woman's palm was on Silvana's cheek slowly stroking her like a caring mother.</p><br><p>"You Operators are so weak and defenseless, sometimes in the heat of battle the Phantoms neglect you, they should be careful with you."</p><br><p>A wave of shame and embarrassment came over Silvana, her face turning red the moment, she jerked her head sharply.</p><br><p>"What are you talking about?! I'm not weak! I... I'm not some pet to be taken care of, I'm an Operator!"</p><br><p>The woman smiled slightly, seeming to realize that she had gone too far.</p><br><p>Not daring to meet her gaze, Silvana muttered:</p><br><p>"Pain Transition... Tell me more about it."</p><br><p>"Well, Silvana, I'm not an Operator, though I do know a lot."</p><br><p>The doctor placed a hand on her side.</p><br><p>"What you did to help Adam is the Pain Transition, there are no secrets here, you've already done it. But... I don't think you realize one thing."</p><br><p>Silvana's gaze darted to her looking for an answer.</p><br><p>"Adam is a K2-Phantom, well... it won't be long before that changes but at the time of the battle it was. That's not the point."</p><br><p>Her expression grew more serious, remembering to observe Silvana's condition.</p><br><p>"Normally, the Operator should only be able to use the Pain Transition when the Phantom reaches K3-Level."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>"B-But... How did I do it then? Why shouldn't I be able to do it... What's the difference between me and the Operator of the K3-Phantom?"</p><br><p>"Hah, how curious you are. Well, I don't mind telling you since you have access to it now."</p><br><p>After a few seconds, she continued:</p><br><p>"I could go on at length about the bond between Phantom and Operator having to be strong enough, about trust and acceptance, but... some factors regardless of your relationship."</p><br><p>The woman shook her hand slightly.</p><br><p>"You would simply lack the energy. Your Evolution Seed doesn't have that much power, it's still a seed, so... someone had to help you, someone gave you a considerable amount of energy."</p><br><br><p>Silvana said sharply leaving the woman stumped.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" she raised an eyebrow in confusion, "What do you mean?"</p><br><p>Silvana put her palm to her chest, feeling an unusual warmth, not from her body but from the flames burning deep inside.</p><br><p>"My Evolution Seed, it has grown... Now it is a sprout... I can feel it, I can see it..."</p><br><p>The woman's eyes narrowed, it didn't look like Silvana was lying and it took her by surprise.</p><br><p>"You see something else? A special energy must be covering your Evolution Sprout."</p><br><p>In response, Silvana nodded slightly.</p><br><p>"Flames, red scalding flames, but... it feels natural to me."</p><br><p>"I see..." the doctor took a deep breath, "So Adam Vinter already fused with the External Artifact. I can congratulate you, pretty soon he'll be a K3-Phantom. He only has one, I'd say formal step left to take."</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Silvana's body, Lone Blaze's silhouette appeared in her mind. Her sly gaze and memories of her plan became vivid.</p><br><p>Panic filled her heart for the first split second, but soon Silvana calmed down. She didn't consider Lone Blaze an enemy, moreover... Lone Blaze's flame became a part of her Evolution Sprout, the beginning of the fire flower.</p><br><p>Then, Silvana remembered something far more important than her not-yet fully healed arm.</p><br><p>"Wait... Where is Adam? Did he win? What happened in the serpent lands and the fortress?"</p><br><p>The woman smiled kindly and mussed Silvana's hair as if she were her daughter.</p><br><p>"Sure, the Crimson Monarch was defeated. Adam Vinter stayed alive. As far as I know, about 30% of all the Phantoms in the fortress survived, as well as most of the squad leaders."</p><br><p>Joy rushed over Silvana mixed with grief for the dead.</p><br><p>"What...? Only 30%... That's just awful. It's not even a third..."</p><br><p>"Yeah, but... If it wasn't for Adam, if it wasn't for your Phantom who defeated the main threat, the number of survivors would be even worse."</p><br><p>Silvana raised her head as if expecting to hear that:</p><br><p>"No one would've survived. That's obvious. The number of survivors would have been 0, so compared to that, 30% is very generous."</p><br><p>Then, the woman checked Silvana's status on her tablet one last time and headed for the exit.</p><br><p>"In thirty minutes, I'll call you in for a procedure. It'll take three or four to completely heal your arm. Don't worry, there won't be any scars left."</p><br><p>Before the doctor could leave, Silvana leaned forward.</p><br><p>"When will Adam be back at the Citadel? Do you know where he is now?"</p><br><p>The woman nodded in confirmation.</p><br><p>"Sure, fighters are flying toward them already. I think they'll reach the fortress in a few minutes. Given the distance and some checks, you should be able to meet up by the end of your treatments."</p><br><p>Then, she left the room, leaving Silvana alone with her thoughts.</p><br><p>She couldn't immerse herself in Adam's inner space, but she could sense that something was happening there. Their bond was growing stronger every day.</p><br><br><p>About the same time, a few minutes before Silvana's awakening, Adam gave himself to the embrace of the Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>A massive crystal floating in the depths of the fortress, the External Artifact slowly lost its rich color, turning gray and featureless.</p><br><p>Soon, cracks covered the majestic object that not long ago was the main treasure of the fortress, now all of it belonged to one Phantom.</p><br><p>At the last moment before the destruction, a scarlet-burning contract appeared between Adam and Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>[All conditions on both sides have been met. The pact is complete.]</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>With a rumbling sound, the crystal shattered into debris, the pieces one after another collapsing to the ground beside Adam's feet.</p><br><p>The next moment when Adam opened his eyes he found himself in his inner space.</p><br><p>But... what he saw there was not what he expected.</p><br><p>The purple serpent, Moira fearfully hovered amidst the darkness, a dense crimson energy like a cloud enveloped her, remembering their long but forever lost connection.</p><br><p>A maiden in a gorgeous dress, with red burning hair and eyes as bright as stars looked up at him with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>Adam ran his gaze over them, with the full realization that they were now part of his power and the responsibility for them rested on him.</p><br><p>"Well... and how am I supposed to deal with all of you?"</p>
