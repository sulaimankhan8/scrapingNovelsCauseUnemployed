            <h4>Chapter 1037: Voracious Beasts</h4><br><p>The Blood Hunter’s escape was watched with amazed faces by all four of them - Heret, Vorx, Risha, and Adam himself.
</p><br><p>He didn’t know what made the monster run away in fear. Moreover, Adam gulped since he didn’t understand how he could have failed to notice the approach of such a weak monster.
</p><br><p>’What the hell was that just now?’ Adam internally muttered.
</p><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana’s voice rang out:
</p><br><p>’Adam... I saw it all... It...’
</p><br><p>As she spoke of the dark aura, Adam’s pupils narrowed as he touched his forehead with his fingertips.
</p><br><p>Then, his gaze went to Risha, wanting to see if the first theory that came to his mind was correct.
</p><br><p>"I see..." he whispered, seeing a faint black mist coming from Risha’s shoulders.
</p><br><br><p>Risha took a step back. Now that Adam manifested his dark aura and saw her one, she could discern that too.
</p><br><p>"What the f-fuck...!" she stammered, fear filling her heart.
</p><br><p>She saw two silhouettes above Adam, they were far more intimidating and grander than her faint dark aura.
</p><br><p>Exchanging glances, Adam and Risha understood.
</p><br><p>Defeating the Hollow Wave monsters gave the two of them something special. A different kind of aura indicates their victories against particularly old and strong monsters.
</p><br><p>’So I was too weak back then? Well, I was only a K2-Phantom, so it’s not surprising.’ Adam looked at his shoulder. ’That dark aura only showed up now. I guess Risha only sees it because I was too close.’
</p><br><p>This was something new to Adam, but he quickly found an explanation. He could feel it, and it showed why the Blood Hunter had run away without even trying to attack.
</p><br><p>What was the point of attacking someone who killed monsters much stronger than you?
</p><br><p>Even Arnoth’s and Kyros’s dead auras made the Blood Hunter’s legs tremble. The victory was out of the question in such a case, only death.
</p><br><p>’Hah, now no wonder the king and queen of snakes didn’t stand a chance against Arnoth and Kreyna.’
</p><br><p>Adam took a deep breath, heading towards the well. The others slowly came to their senses.
</p><br><p>’As Arnoth said, at the New Wave, only exceptional individuals can compete with the monsters of the Hollow Wave.’
</p><br><p>At that moment, the Plague Reaper’s figure reflected in Adam’s mind.
</p><br><p>’Hah, I’m sure... If that bastard continued his evolution, he would tear Kreyna apart.’
</p><br><p>Heret and Vorx glanced over, slightly baffled. They couldn’t see Adam and Risha’s dark auras, but deep inside, they knew what it was.
</p><br><p>They had to defeat the powerful opponents in their path if they ever wanted to surpass the king and queen.
</p><br><br><br><p>Adam stepped to the edge of the well, peering into the depths.
</p><br><p>"Alright, so... somewhere down there is the blood essence?"
</p><br><p>"Yes, that’s right. A few times, I and other strong serpents managed to get the blood essences while hunting, but only from the wells. We never ventured deep into the lake."
</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, confused.
</p><br><p>"Hmm? The well is much narrower. Isn’t that more dangerous?"
</p><br><p>"Hah! Boy, do you think we’re stupid?" Vorx chuckled as flames blazed across his hands. "The essences are closely guarded by the Voracious Beasts, but they are easily lured out. As soon as they feel a threat to the essence, they immediately show their vile jaws!"
</p><br><p>Before Heret could stop the reckless Vorx, he gathered the flames into a single point and unleashed a beam of flame directly at the bottom of the well.
</p><br><p>Heret froze in place, staring at the bubbling blood that soon exploded in a crimson geyser, washing over the twisted roots.
</p><br><p>"Fuck... Vorx, you moron, I’m serious..."
</p><br><p>"Hahahahaha! We would have done it anyway!"
</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, six shadows swept amongst the blood, circling around the round object.
</p><br><p>Risha stepped back, clutching her spear tightly. Her instincts told her that these were enemies far more formidable than the Blood Hunters or the Blood Reapers.
</p><br><p>Six beasts with red hide, long claws and tails surrounded the crystal sphere, a bright scarlet star was trapped inside. The crystal shell did not allow the blood essence to dissipate, it constantly released its energy outward filling the well and feeding the Voracious Beasts.
</p><br><p>Each of the Voracious Beasts had an elongated jaw with sharp teeth, three eyes, the largest in the middle, and flows of blood running down their backs.
</p><br><p>Their auras weren’t as powerful as Arnoth’s or Kreyna’s, but none of the S4 monsters could compare to them.
</p><br><p>"Prepare for a tough fight!" Heret exclaimed like an army commander as green flames ran down his forearms. "The Voracious Beasts are the strongest regenerative monsters at the blood pond that serpents are allowed to fight. We can defeat them, but it will be difficult!"
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes grew wide for a moment.
</p><br><p>He realized what was behind Heret’s words - the Voracious Beasts were the most dangerous on the hunting list, not overall.
</p><br><p>Heret waved a hand, retreating backwards. "There are six of them for four of us! We need to scatter to the side and take on one of the Voracious Beasts each. I’m sure the other two will guard the blood essence!"
</p><br><p>Undeterred, Vorx and Risha nodded to each other and bounced back. They directed their auras towards the nearest Voracious Beasts, provoking them to chase. Heret did the same.
</p><br><br><p>But... Adam decided to disobey his commander’s orders.
</p><br><p>"Adam! This could be dangerous! They’re... Not simple regenerative monsters!" Heret exclaimed in an attempt to change Adam’s mind.
</p><br><p>This only brought a smile to Adam’s face.
</p><br><p>"Don’t worry. I’m sticking to the plan. We’ll each take on one beast. Just..." he stretched his arm out to the side. "I’ll deal with the guards right away."
</p><br><p>The first needle appeared in his grip with a black-and-white flash.
</p><br><p>"You said it yourself - we’re on the hunt! So, I’ll earn this essence!"
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, two of the three Voracious Beasts found themselves to Adam’s left and right. Before their jaws could open, he executed a smooth horizontal sweep.
</p><br><br><p>A black line passed through, splitting their bodies in two.
</p><br><p>But, instead of regenerating like all other monsters of this type, new jaws emerged from the halves of their bodies, pouncing on Adam like hungry piranhas.</p>
