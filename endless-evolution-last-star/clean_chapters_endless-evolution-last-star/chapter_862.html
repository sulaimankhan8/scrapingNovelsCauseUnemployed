            <br><p>Silence fell for a brief period.</p><br><p>Adam stared intently at Giselle, anxiety slowly growing inside him - he felt that he wouldn't like what he was about to hear.</p><br><p>"A condition for you to be sure I will fight?"</p><br><p>Then, with a wheeze, he added:</p><br><p>"What do you want? My word isn't enough for you?"</p><br><p>Two days ago Adam wouldn't have even paid attention to Giselle. However, the situation had changed dramatically. After listening to Silvana's analysis, he realized that this was his chance to fix his reputation.</p><br><p>Giselle had come to them on her own - it was his best option to start his winning streak and earn three twilight coins.</p><br><p>Sure, deep inside Adam didn't want to give up the idea of just giving up two more times, but in his mind, he knew it was too risky.</p><br><p>Moreover... he was a little curious as to what Giselle was capable of. After all, K3-Level was a new stage for him, where he was a beginner.</p><br><p>With a slight nod, Giselle confirmed:</p><br><p>"Your word will be sufficient, but I want something more from you - Adam Vinter."</p><br><p>Her gray eyes pierced Adam, showing that in the time given her to prepare for his last fight, she studied his history and accomplishments well.</p><br><p>"I need a swear from you. Swear that you will fight me seriously as if I were the Crimson Monarch."</p><br><p>It was obvious from Adam's face that he expected more.</p><br><p>However, no sooner did he say the first words than Giselle pointed at Silvana.</p><br><p>"Swear on her life. Swear on your Operator's life."</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a shadow fell over the calm Giselle. Two menacing blue eyes like cold stars cast their gaze upon her.</p><br><p>Adam said nothing, but his increased aura made Silvana catch her breath.</p><br><p>"What, I don't think you realize what you're asking...? Arrogant noblewoman."</p><br><p>His quiet voice was full of rising anger.</p><br><p>Sure, it was only a request, but Giselle had involved Silvana in this, it couldn't please Adam.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Giselle nodded slightly. She was prepared for this reaction and she wasn't about to back down.</p><br><p>"Yes. I'm not asking you to put her life on the line. When you lose, nothing will happen to Silvana Desio. I want my last fight to be worthy. I think you've already realized that for us, the higher nobles who made it to the Twilight Palace, reputation comes first."</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes. He was listening intently to Giselle, so he couldn't help but notice that she wasn't considering other options besides her victory.</p><br><p>Well, she had reason to be so confident.</p><br><p>Closing his eyes to ponder, Giselle folded her hands together.</p><br><p>"I'm offering you a good deal. After our fight, you'll have one coin left and everyone will know you're serious. Then, do what you want - give up on purpose like you did before or try to fight and earn four coins."</p><br><br><p>With a thud, Adam returned to his seat, staring intently at Giselle.</p><br><p>"Hmm... You don't even seem to think I'm capable of defeating you. You wouldn't be the first to be ruined by arrogance."</p><br><p>"Arrogance?" she looked up, "Adam, of the two of us, you're the one showing arrogance."</p><br><p>Her statement baffled Adam, he didn't think so.</p><br><p>Giselle shook her hand.</p><br><p>"As I said earlier. Unlike the others, I recognized you. My Operator helped me find a lot of information about you. Your fight history is impressive and that's why I want you as my opponent, but... you won't win."</p><br><p>Adam didn't say anything, but his expression seemed to ask.</p><br><p>'Why? What a reason?'</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, Giselle continued.</p><br><p>"You became a K3-Phantom a few days ago. Sure, I'm new at this stage too, but I've already learned a few things and gone through a couple of fights here."</p><br><br><p>Her eyes grew deeper, full of pride in her family name. After all, her family was the third of twelve, holding a place of honor at the first wing.</p><br><p>"Don't think you're the only talented fighter. I don't know defeat from opponents of equal strength to me, much less those weaker, such as you. It's just a good deal for both of us and a useful experience for you as the new K3-Phantom."</p><br><p>Then, Giselle waved her hand.</p><br><p>"I think you heard me. Either you now swear on Silvana's life to me that you'll fight at full strength, or I'll leave and find another opponent. At the Twilight Palace, there are many who wish to compete with me in power."</p><br><p>Adam frowned. He bit his lip, glancing at Silvana from time to time. It was hard for him to decide on something so important, even though it wasn't a bet, but a swear that showed how much his word could be trusted.</p><br><p>"Fine..." he grumbled.</p><br><p>His eyes grew deeper as he put a palm to his chest, pressing against his heart.</p><br><p>"I swear on Silvana's life that I will fight you at full strength as if you were the Crimson Monarch, my last and strongest opponent."</p><br><p>Undeterred, Giselle rose as she bowed low in respect.</p><br><p>"I have heard you. I appreciate it. Our fight will take place this evening, at the Amber Cloud, the same place where I fought against my last opponent. I hope the publicity doesn't scare you."</p><br><p>Without further ado, Giselle left the café, leaving Adam and Silvana alone.</p><br><p>Silvana touched Adam's shoulder, concern in her eyes.</p><br><p>"Hey... I don't mind you making a pledge like that, but are you sure? Giselle... She looks strong."</p><br><p>Then, her eyes sparkled as she realized Adam's plan.</p><br><p>"Oh, I see. You'll fight, but you'll lose, there we can get out of here quickly, right?"</p><br><p>Saying nothing, Adam turned, staring intently at her, while his blue eyes grew brighter, filling with stars like a constellation in the dark sky.</p><br><br><p>As arranged, in the evening Adam and Giselle left their suites and headed for the Amber Cloud, separately.</p><br><p>That restaurant always had been crowded, but now there were people even outside the building in the middle of the wide hallway of the hotel, which resembled a great square in size.</p><br><p>There wasn't a single free table, all the seats were taken and most of the nobles weren't going to order anything but a few drinks and appetizers.</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that they had come here not because Giselle was going to fight against Adam Vinter, they hadn't seen any of the fighters yet, but because this would be Giselle's last fight.</p><br><p>Every time a nobleman was about to receive the fifth twilight coin, the event attracted a lot of attention.</p><br><p>Giselle was one of the most famous and prominent nobles, a true talent and her family's hope for a great future.</p><br><p>She was a K3-Phantom, but her past achievements were worthy as well.</p><br><p>All the higher nobles from the Twelve Branches heard of her, they knew what kind of Phantom she was and what she was capable of.</p><br><p>So, everyone was curious to see what kind of performance she would show at the end of her journey at the Twilight Palace.</p><br><br><p>Muffled footsteps sounded from the north side, just as a few days ago, Giselle had arrived at the Amber Cloud via this path.</p><br><p>She stood in the middle of the arena, silently waiting for her opponent.</p><br><p>Soon, a second silhouette appeared, but strangely enough, it was not Adam, but a tall man with thick blond, almost golden hair and deep blue eyes.</p><br><p>It was observer No. 3. Something made him different from the others, his carefree stride, sly grin, and almost closed eyes.</p><br><p>In his hand was a single black case that he left at Giselle's feet.</p><br><p>Then, the man stepped aside. He glanced at the clock as his eyebrow rose.</p><br><p>"Heh, Ms. Giselle, looks like your opponent is running late."</p><br><p>His sweet, insidious snake-like voice did not embarrass Giselle in the slightest. She silently took her rapier from the case, placed the weapon on her belt, and continued to wait.</p><br><p>The observer, No. 3, whistled, gazing intently at the crowd.</p><br><p>"Well, well. I can wait as long as it takes, but what about you Ms. Giselle? How long are you willing to wait for Adam Vinter?"</p><br><p>Giselle's eyes darted to the man, her gaze was menacing, for she realized he did it on purpose.</p><br><p>Immediately, whispers began amongst the crowd.</p><br><p>'Agh...? The observer said that her opponent was Adam Vinter. Who the hell is that?'</p><br><p>'Hah, isn't that the guy who ordered dozens of dishes a few days ago and ate like a pig? Just a commoner who was allowed in here out of order.'</p><br><p>'Hm? A commoner? But... Why then did Giselle choose to fight against him in her last battle?'</p><br><p>One of the nobles nonchalantly shrugged.</p><br><p>'Well, she probably just wants an easy fight.'</p><br><br><p>'Ghm... I didn't expect this from Giselle. Did we really come here for nothing?'</p><br><p>After a few minutes, under a hail of taunts about Adam, some of the nobles began to remember hearing the name before.</p><br><p>One of them tapped the table, a bottle of expensive wine standing in the middle.</p><br><p>"Wait..." he muttered in disbelief, "Adam Vinter... That name... Isn't he..."</p><br><p>At the same moment, a silhouette appeared in the distance.</p><br><br><p>Footsteps echoed off the great walls while Adam approached the battlefield. Silvana followed him.</p><br><p>Observer No. 3 looked at his watch again.</p><br><p>"Hah, fifteen minutes. Surely no one dared be late for your fight so much Ms. Giselle."</p><br><br><p>Giselle stared intently at Adam, deep inside anticipating her colorful victory.</p>
