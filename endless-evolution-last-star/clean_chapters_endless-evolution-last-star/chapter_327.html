            <br><p>When Plague Reaper entered Fume Cathedral, he used his aura to bend the Fume Statues to his will and make everyone else tremble in fear.</p><br><p>The reaction was more than expressive - the monsters were cornered and Lero vomited, unable to withstand the pressure coming from this monster.</p><br><p>But, now that Plague Reaper found himself in a battle against Fume Throne, he had to find a way to stop the snow-white swords woven from dense energy.</p><br><p>There were many ways to do this: dodge, block, or destroy targets. Plague Reaper decided to choose a unique and universal option that would not have worked in any other situation.</p><br><p>Since the six snow-white swords were controlled by the Fume Throne's aura rather than energy, they could be affected by the enemy's aura even though they were made of energy.</p><br><p>Sure, even the most powerful aura can't stop an energy source, but if Plague Reaper blocks or suppresses the Fume Throne's aura, the energy will simply dissipate, because the source that controls it will be gone.</p><br><p>In order to do something like that, one needed to have a really powerful aura, and Plague Reaper definitely had no problem with that.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The empty space between Plague Reaper's palm and the white sword trembled slightly, sending ripples into the air, then a ghostly black flame began to emanate from Plague Reaper, growing larger with every second.</p><br><p>"Shit. Activate your auras if you don't want to pass out!" Adam said confidently before activating his The Will.</p><br><p>At the same moment, everyone had to show who was at what level. Sure, most K1-Phantoms didn't know how to use their auras properly, usually they were only trained when they moved up to K2-Level.</p><br><p>However, everyone here was pretty strong K1-Phantoms, and definitely not only Adam knew how to use The Will. At least he hoped so.</p><br><p>"What? But... I don't know how to do that!" Lero exclaimed in panic, it was obvious by the look in his eyes that this was an impossible task for him.</p><br><p>Erla quickly turned her head from side to side as if trying to find someone who could help her.</p><br><p>"Damn, you two don't know how to use aura?" Adam uttered, realizing the severity of the problem.</p><br><p>Lero and Erla looked guiltily at Adam, they realized that their lack of skill was endangering all their lives.</p><br><p>Suddenly, a golden glow appeared over Oskar, and a transparent massive sword that was his First Stage Spirit formed over his head.</p><br><p>"Agh, it looks like we have no choice but to resist his aura. Erla, Lero, get behind us. Our auras will be able to protect you." Oskar bit his lip and clenched his fists tightly, "I hope so..."</p><br><p>Erla and Lero glanced over before quickly hiding behind Oskar, whose aura seemed truly powerful to them.</p><br><p>Then, they were joined by another Spirit that looked like a massive green seed from which roots were actively growing.</p><br><p>"Well, well, looks like someone didn't spend enough time practicing and couldn't reach the next stage, right?" Adam said with slight irony in his voice.</p><br><p>Katrin frowned but didn't answer anything. She stood next to Oskar and in front of Lero, letting him handle this crisis behind her.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's aura began to intensify dramatically, spreading around and engulfing the snow-white sword that hovered in front of his palm. The invisible defenses around the sword began to shake vigorously until Fume Throne's aura weakened so much that it could no longer hold the energy in the sword.</p><br><p>The dark aura like death itself engulfed the sword, completely breaking it and causing the energy to dissipate, but Fume Throne still had five swords that actively began to rotate.</p><br><p>Fume Throne was not going to hold back anymore and was going to unleash its full power on Plague Reaper in one attack, but Plague Reaper was not going to restrain himself either.</p><br><p>His aura that covered him like black flames rushed upwards, transforming into a skull with a crazed gaze and an insidious grin.</p><br><p>Auras couldn't make sounds, much less speak, but the movement of this skull made it seem as if it was laughing, with savage pleasure and genuine cruelty.</p><br><p>The Plague Reaper's aura expanded dramatically at that moment, engulfing everything around it: the remaining five swords, the monsters, and the Phantoms.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils narrowed as he released his aura, immediately summoning a second-stage Spirit. He hoped it would be enough to keep Plague Reaper's aura from destroying them.</p><br><br><p>Behind them, there were sounds, hurried and panic-filled. Adam turned around and saw that the monsters that had been hiding in the dark corners were coming toward them.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the monsters were not going to attack them. In this situation, they looked more like frightened animals than intimidating monsters.</p><br><p>This wasn't surprising, because compared to them or the other creatures near Fume Cathedral, only the one who sat on the Fume Throne, only Plague Reaper could proudly bear the title of monster.</p><br><p>'Hah, those bastards. Decided to use our auras to defend against Plague Reaper? Well, we don't have the time or ability to fight them, so we'll just have to ignore them. Damn, what kind of situation is this anyway?' Adam frowned, maintaining control of his Spirit.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The five white swords were actively trembling, unable to resist Plague Reaper's aura, so... at Fume Throne's will, all five swords began to merge into one, becoming a huge, two-handed sword.</p><br><p>In some ways, this sword was similar to Oskar's one, but it was much larger and looked majestic. Energy streams ran along its blade, and white flames emanated from the hilt. The aura field around the sword became much more powerful, pushing away Plague Reaper's aura despite its eerie nature.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Plague Reaper's aura reached Adam and the others. Oskar, Katrin, and Adam's auras were strong enough to contain the black flames in front of them, but something was bothering Adam.</p><br><p>'Hmm... His aura seems to convey his very essence, moreover, this skull... is it his second stage Spirit or... is it only a first stage one?' Adam frowned heavily.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's black aura couldn't suppress their auras, but that didn't stop the black flames coming from the skull from gradually destroying their auras like a plague.</p><br><p>It was only tiny particles, white, gold, and green, slowly falling to the ground before turning into nothing.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper frowned slightly.</p><br><p>He felt that this huge sword could actually become a threat to him. For a moment, his gaze traveled towards the coffin embedded in the ground next to the throne, but... Plague Reaper quickly abandoned that idea.</p><br><p>Instead of using other means, he just waved his hand carelessly and yawned widely, as if bored.</p><br><p>Then, Plague Reaper stretched his hand forward, giving a command to Skull, his aura.</p><br><br><p>The skull grinned widely and actively shuddered, transforming into something completely new. Dark flames began to form a long tattered cloak covering the tall silhouette.</p><br><p>The arms and legs of the tall silhouette were completely hidden, but in the silhouette's hands was a massive scythe with a curved blade, so... from beneath the cloak could be seen bone fingers like those of death itself.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide as a thick black wave of aura came from Plague Reaper's Spirit, more like a wave of plague coming at the will of the end.</p>
