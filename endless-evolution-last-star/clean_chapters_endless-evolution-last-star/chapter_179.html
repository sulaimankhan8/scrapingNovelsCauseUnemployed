            <br><p>After Tron's test was finished, Narata passed it successfully. Their meeting continued, but not in the same tense atmosphere as before.</p><br><p>Narata received Tron's approval, learned a lot from Riska, and realized, with Adam's help, that she had to completely renounce the Phantom's identity.</p><br><p>In fact, she was extremely lucky that Tron had decided to help them because such cases were quite few.</p><br><p>Riska carefully stood up and looked at Narata.</p><br><p>"I need to retire to the restroom, are you coming?"</p><br><p>Riska had some deal to Narata, or she wouldn't have emphasized it so much.</p><br><p>Narata nodded uncertainly. She had no idea what Riska wanted to talk to her about.</p><br><p>The girls left, and Adam was alone with Tron. Perhaps this was a good opportunity to discuss sublime topics or serious matters, especially about monsters and the Big Three.</p><br><p>But... Neither of them was in the mood for that.</p><br><p>"More pancakes?" Tron asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><br><br><p>"Sure, I'm not full at all."</p><br><br><p>Riska stood in front of the mirror, putting on light, pink lipstick, almost invisible considering the natural color of her lips.</p><br><p>"Did you want something?" Narata asked, looking around.</p><br><p>"Ugum." Riska nodded, removing her lipstick and standing in front of Narata.</p><br><p>Then, Riska stretched her arms forward with her palms open. Narata looked at her, puzzled, not guessing her intentions.</p><br><p>"Go ahead, place your palms against mine and squeeze them tightly. I'll do the same." Riska said with a serious look.</p><br><p>Narata did as she asked and firmly gripped Riska's palms, running her fingers through hers - their hands were in a tight lock.</p><br><p>Riska tensed her fingers, which was evident in her swollen veins, and Narata did the same, exerting considerably more force.</p><br><p>"Argh!" Riska frowned heavily as she dropped to her knees, looking up at Narata from below, but she made no move to remove her grip.</p><br><p>Riska's face was twisted in pain, it was obvious that she was actually experiencing it.</p><br><p>Narata was shocked at what was happening. Her eyes went wide, she didn't know why this was going on and what she had to do.</p><br><p>'What...? What's wrong?' Narata inwardly muttered in confusion, 'Riska is a K1-Phantom like me... Moreover, she seemed to be at an even higher level...'</p><br><p>"Please... stop... it hurts..." Riska pleaded, clenching her teeth hard.</p><br><p>"Oh... of course! Please forgive me!" Narata was quick to respond, releasing Riska's hands.</p><br><p>Riska finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><br><p>"What was that...?" Narata asked with a worried look.</p><br><p>Riska smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"It's something you haven't realized yet. Narata, Operators don't have the kind of power you used just now." Riska looked at her with a good-hearted look.</p><br><p>Narata flinched, she was beginning to realize what Riska was trying to show her.</p><br><p>"As you might have noticed. I haven't used my Phantom power at all. I'm no different from a normal human, maybe only slightly stronger due to past combat experience and training, but nothing more than that. In my current state, I could easily be defeated by two military men." Riska calmly said.</p><br><p>Her words would have sounded like a real curse to any Phantom. However, there was no bitterness or disappointment in her voice. On the contrary, Riska sounded proud, as this was a true accomplishment for her.</p><br><p>"How... how did you do it...?" Narata asked with a curious look.</p><br><p>Riska smiled weakly.</p><br><p>"It's nothing complicated. Just try to lower your power like you do with the aura. You won't succeed immediately, and it'll take weeks to get the full effect."</p><br><p>Narata nodded deeply, then put her palm to her chest and asked, "Is this permanent? I mean..."</p><br><p>Riska shook her head.</p><br><p>"If I want to, I can regain my full strength within ten minutes. It's like comparing it to an engine - if you don't use it, it will cool down and get dusty. However, once you give it fuel, the engine roars to life."</p><br><p>Narata wanted to say something, she opened her mouth, but Riska beat her to it.</p><br><p>"But... You don't want to do that. Be an Operator, be like an ordinary person. It's better to leave nothing from your past life behind, it'll be easier that way, I speak from experience." Riska said seriously.</p><br><p>Narata was silent for a while, then she nodded understandingly.</p><br><p>"I... I'll try my best. I want to become like you."</p><br><p>"Good job. And... there's something else." Riska narrowed her eyes, staring intently at Narata.</p><br><p>Narata tilted her head in confusion.</p><br><br><p>Riska swung her hand sharply, grabbing Narata firmly by the side, or rather by a fold of fat, that was almost invisible, but Riska had no trouble spotting it.</p><br><p>"Ouch. What's gotten into you?" Narata frowned.</p><br><p>"You see that? This is unacceptable!" Riska exclaimed menacingly, with a fiery glare.</p><br><p>Narata just gulped, she didn't have the strength to respond to Riska right now.</p><br><p>"You've gotten weight in the last few days, haven't you?"</p><br><p>Narata quickly nodded a few times.</p><br><p>"Agh." Riska sighed heavily, "I've had that too. Look, you realize that you have to look perfect as an Operator for your Phantom, don't you?"</p><br><p>"Sure... It's basic, it's been talked about many times at the academy..." Narata replied uncertainly, "Operators should always take care of their clothes, body, and hair. All to maintain the importance of status."</p><br><br><p>"Narata, don't forget, you are no longer a Phantom, so you should watch what you eat and in what quantity."</p><br><p>Riska continued with a serious stare:</p><br><p>"If you're a Phantom, it's almost impossible to get fat - it takes a huge amount of energy, including simple calories, to use abilities, fight, and train. All energy is directed either to the muscles or to regenerate reserves. However, if you don't fight and use your abilities like I do, you can gain extra kilos very quickly."</p><br><p>Riska blushed slightly, covering her mouth with the palm of her hand as if she was embarrassed to talk about it.</p><br><p>"Khm. When we first started working with Tron, I was eating like normal, and in just a month, I gained 10 kilograms. Damn... I was so embarrassed when Tron told me about it, and the worst part..." Riska bit her lip.</p><br><br><p>"Losing weight is damn hard... especially after you get used to eating in a day as much as the average person doesn't eat in a week. Anyway, if I were you, I'd make sure you don't have to go through it." Riska said seriously, placing her palm on Narata's shoulder encouragingly.</p><br><p>Narata nodded. She had never had this kind of problem before, but she knew from Riska's look that she was better off not checking it out and going on a diet right away!</p><br><br><p>The door opened as Narata and Riska came out of the restroom, approaching the table.</p><br><p>Their conversation went on for quite some time, and in that time, Adam and Tron managed to create a small disaster.</p><br><p>The empty plates on their table could be used to build towers because there were so many of them.</p><br><p>It was unknown how many pancakes they had eaten or if there was anything else at their feast, but no ordinary person could have eaten so many in such a short period.</p><br><p>"Oh, you're finally here. Would you like dessert?" Tron asked with a raised eyebrow. For a moment, his gaze shifted to Riska's hands, to her reddened knuckles.</p><br><p>Riska and Narata looked over at each other.</p><br><p>"No. We'll pass." Riska waved her hand with a slight smile.</p><br><p>Tron shrugged before placing his order.</p>
