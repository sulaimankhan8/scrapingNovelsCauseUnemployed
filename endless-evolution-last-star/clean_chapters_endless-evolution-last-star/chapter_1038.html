            <h4>Chapter 1038: No arm for you (Part 1)</h4><br><p>Adam expected the Voracious Beasts to have fairly powerful regeneration, but he realized that they were the strongest regenerative monsters he had encountered.
</p><br><p>And, his assumptions turned out to be correct, but in a slightly different way.
</p><br><p>Instead of immediately regenerating their wounds, the two Voracious Beasts that were cut had grown new jaws.
</p><br><p>"Oh... This is like nothing I’ve ever seen before..." Adam’s eyes went wide as the four inferior creatures pounced on him.
</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that the Voracious Beasts didn’t split like cells, two new ones didn’t emerge from the bottom and top of one monster.
</p><br><br><p>The jaws collapsed into the ground where Adam had been a moment ago. He bounced to the side, curiously watching the strange monsters.
</p><br><p>One shudder and the four pieces transformed back into two monsters.
</p><br><p>’Hmm... Their aura hasn’t changed at all...’ Adam muttered, slightly bewildered.
</p><br><p>Every time the regenerative monster healed wounds, especially the deadly ones, it used up a lot of energy, which affected its aura. Adam was stronger than them, he would easily sense even the smallest fluctuations in energy.
</p><br><p>The, his gaze locked onto the bloody streams running down their backs. He couldn’t know this for sure, but it seemed to him that they had become a little smaller.
</p><br><p>’I see, so this is some sort of storage for them? They’ll continue to regenerate and stay at the peak of their strength while I expend energy. Hah, not bad.’
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Suddenly, the Voracious Beasts’ frames trembled as the bloody streams shone brightly. Their bodies contorted as in the shadows they merged into one body.
</p><br><p>Adam’s jaw practically dropped as he watched the two monsters transform into one massive Voracious Beast.
</p><br><p>In general, other than its size, the fused Voracious Beast was no different from its usual form, except for the number of eyes, the monster now had six, four small and two large.
</p><br><p>A slight smirk appeared on Adam’s face as he slung the massive needle over his shoulder.
</p><br><p>"Hah, not only can you grow the right body parts anywhere, but you can fuse into something stronger? Well..." he stepped forward. "Show what you can do, big guy!"
</p><br><p>At the same time, the last of the Voracious Beast remained at the edge of the well, watching the battles closely. Its job was to guard the essence, no one was to get their treasure.
</p><br><br><p>Despite its size, the big Voracious Beast became much faster. The monster didn’t become twice as strong, 50% stronger for sure, which was an impressive rate considering how easily the Voracious Beasts made the fusion.
</p><br><p>Throwing its shadow at Adam, the Voracious Beast opened its jaw wide, about to devour Adam, but collided with the blade of his needle.
</p><br><br><p>The jaw collided with the needle, and the blade easily cut through the Voracious Beast’s hide and bone. In fact, this was the monster’s plan, for as soon as the blade passed through further, the cut behind instantly regenerated.
</p><br><p>Thus, the Voracious Beast wanted Adam’s needle forced into its jaws.
</p><br><p>"Hey, you don’t look like someone who comes up with cunning plans at all. Let’s not ruin my impression of you."
</p><br><p>With that, Adam stepped forward effortlessly, slashing the massive beast.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The Voracious Beast’s edges of flesh shuddered, raining bloody projectiles down on Adam. It was a trap from the start. The Voracious Beasts were smart enough monsters to know how to use their regeneration not only for defense but also for attack.
</p><br><p>This only caused Adam to give an amused smile.
</p><br><p>The crimson flames burst out from his shoulder as the long cape of the fallen knight covered his back. The Voracious Beast’s attack had no chance of breaking through that protective layer.
</p><br><p>Then, Adam’s gaze turned serious as a multitude of black streaks appeared around him - each at the sweep of his needle.
</p><br><p>All six eyes of the Voracious Beast narrowed as the monster tried to regenerate, but Adam was too fast. Moreover, the crimson energy remained floating in the air, burning the nearest flesh in clots of flame.
</p><br><p>Realizing that it was impossible to win, the big Voracious Beast once again turned into two beasts that with badly damaged bodies tried to run away.
</p><br><br><p>Adam jumped back and grabbed the beast by the tail, leaving his sword on the ground. He threw the monster at the second one, predicting it to crash into the rock among the roots.
</p><br><p>Then, all the crimson clots of his power gene, rained down on the Voracious Beasts that didn’t have time to regain their senses.
</p><br><p>The devastating explosion left no trace of the two monsters, only a few dark drops of blood falling to the ground.
</p><br><p>’What do you think?’ Silvana asked, watching the fight through his eyes.
</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head, serene stride heading towards the last of the Voracious Beasts.
</p><br><p>’Not bad, they’re a lot stronger than the Blood Hunters or the Blood Reapers, but... they’re definitely not the Hollow Wave monsters. Kreyna would easily defeat them, let alone Arnoth.’
</p><br><p>The Voracious Beast became wary. It didn’t know what to do. All its instincts told it to run, but... even more, it didn’t want to lose its treasure!
</p><br><br><p>Adam lifted his chin arrogantly, looking at the frightened beast.
</p><br><p>"What are you going to do, little one?"
</p><br><br><p>Without a moment’s hesitation, the Voracious Beast dived to the bottom of the well, leaving the crystal shell and the blood essence on the surface.
</p><br><p>"You know, it’s a telling difference between monsters and humans." Adam chuckled, grabbing the crystal shell.
</p><br><p>Silvana tilted her head. "What are you talking about?
</p><br><p>"How can I put this..." Adam clenched his fist, causing the crystal shell to crack. "Between survival and greed, a monster will always choose survival. But, a man? Hah, many in this beast’s shoes would be willing to die to keep their treasure!"
</p><br><p>The crystal shell shattered as the blood essence flew into Adam’s chest. With a wide smile on his face, he expected his arm to grow back now, but... instead, the blood essence headed elsewhere.
</p><br><p>A bright red star broke through the dense layer of darkness, penetrating right into the third keyhole without leaving a single speck of energy for Adam.</p>
