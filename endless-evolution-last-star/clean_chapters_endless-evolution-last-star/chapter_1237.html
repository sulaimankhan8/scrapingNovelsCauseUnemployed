            <br><br><p>Bright lights from several sources illuminated the white, sterile room where a young man with black hair and deep blue eyes lay on a chair in the center.</p><br><p>His arm was placed in a special chamber with several tubes attached to it through which a green liquid flowed.</p><br><p>This was the first of many steps necessary to heal Adam’s arm.</p><br><p>Opposite him stood a tall woman in a white coat with black hair framing her face. Her prominent cheekbones and black eyes made her already stern gaze even more menacing.</p><br><p>This was not the kind of doctor you would want to bring your child to, but it was one you could definitely trust.</p><br><p>On her coat, at the chest, was written – “Dr. Gia.”</p><br><p>“Damn, kid, with wounds like that, you should have come straight back to Bastion, or better yet, straight to the Citadel, since that’s your home.” Gia frowned. “Do you even realize how much you’ve complicated my job by wandering around for hours?!”</p><br><p>Adam only smiled weakly. Long gone were the days when a medic or some military guy could scare him or pressure him with their authority. Even if it had been someone from the Gamma Division, that was no longer Adam’s level.</p><br><p>“Well, I just wanted to get some fresh air after the battle. I had to defeat a rather dangerous monster, you know?”</p><br><p>Gia rolled her eyes.</p><br><p>“Of course! I was given all the information about you a long time ago, Adam Vinterrrrr!” She hissed like a snake. “Every time you end up in the infirmary, it means something bad has happened to you.”</p><br><p>In response, Adam shrugged.</p><br><p>“Hah, this time I managed to keep my arm, didn’t I?”</p><br><p>“Oh, yeah, that’s definitely progress, because the last two times you lost it completely! Damn it.”</p><br><p>Gia shook her head as she approached the panel, watching Adam’s condition and monitoring his treatment.</p><br><p>Phantoms were different from ordinary people from a medical standpoint. No matter what happened to an ordinary person, if they were still alive, with all the technology humanity had, medics could save that person’s life.</p><br><p>Sure, not everyone received such treatment. For the best treatment, that person had to have status or money, but the point was not that, but the energy.</p><br><p>If a Phantom was wounded, the medic would treat them similarly to how they would treat an ordinary person. It all depended on the nature of the wounds and how powerful the Phantom was.</p><br><p>But if a Phantom was not wounded but had lost a part of its body, things became really complicated.</p><br><p>For a K4 Phantom like Adam, medics couldn’t do anything. They could heal all his bruises, scratches, and cuts, but they couldn’t even restore his finger. They simply didn’t have enough materials and energy.</p><br><p>So, Adam was right when he reminded them that his arm was still there, albeit in a very damaged state.</p><br><p>Gia could restore his arm to its previous state because all the energy in his flesh, bones, and blood had been preserved. Otherwise, Adam would have to go hunting for the Regenerative Monsters again. That was not part of his immediate plans.</p><br><p>“What about Fromund? He also suffered quite a few wounds. It seemed to me that he was more exhausted than I was,” Adam asked.</p><br><br><p>“That’s right. He doesn’t have as serious injuries as you, but he suffered more wounds overall. In any case, we will quickly restore you both.”</p><br><br><p>At the same time, the metal chamber opened as several mechanical arms with blades at their tips emerged from a panel nearby.</p><br><p>“Remove as much energy as you can from your arm, or I won’t even be able to scratch your skin.”</p><br><p>Adam grinned, complying with her request. “Hey, what about anesthesia? It’s going to hurt!”</p><br><p>Gia shot him a stern look.</p><br><p>“I already administered the necessary dose, and considering the wounds you keep coming back with from the Dead Lands, you like it, right? Maybe you’re a masochist?”</p><br><p>“Nah, I don’t like pa…”</p><br><p>Suddenly, Adam’s face contorted as several knives dug into his hand, quickly making the necessary incisions to reconnect the torn veins and tendons as well as the protruding bones.</p><br><p>Only a few minutes later, Gia finished and moved on to the next stage, in which she and the mechanical arms restored Adam’s arm to its former appearance.</p><br><p>“Tsk.” Ada frowned. “Couldn’t you just put me in one of your healing capsules? Wouldn’t that have helped me?”</p><br><p>Strangely, Gia did not respond with her usual cheeky joke. She shook her head with a serious expression.</p><br><p>“No. Even with your strength, you are still human, and your body obeys certain rules. Without medical supervision, your bones would have healed incorrectly, and I would have had to perform the surgery anyway.”</p><br><p>She made several stitches, connecting the two edges of the flesh.</p><br><p>“If you had a simple fracture, I would have done just that, but… There are more than ten fractures in different places in your arm, and in some parts, the bone is shattered.”</p><br><br><p>Adam took a deep breath.</p><br><p>“Hey, who treats the Second Rank Phantoms? I mean, if you’re treating me, that means you’re one of the highest-ranking medics, right?”</p><br><p>A proud smile appeared on Gia’s face. She was pleased by Adam’s assumption.</p><br><p>“Something like that. The Second Rank Phantoms… Well, I can’t tell you about it, but they don’t need medical help in the same way that other Phantoms and ordinary people do.”</p><br><p>Adam didn’t respond, but at that moment, he realized that Gia’s white coat wasn’t just because she was a medic, but also because she was a member of the Gamma Division.</p><br><p>Now that he focused, he could feel a special aura emanating from her.</p><br><p>“I hope I won’t have to go through a long recovery? I have a lot of work ahead of me.” Adam asked.</p><br><p>Gia chuckled. “Hah, eager to get back into the fight? Don’t worry, your arm will be in working order a few hours after I finish my work. You won’t see any difference.”</p><br><p>“Good. That’s what I need. I can’t stop. Not now…”</p>
