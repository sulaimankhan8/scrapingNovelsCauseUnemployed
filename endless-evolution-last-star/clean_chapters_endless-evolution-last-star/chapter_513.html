            <br><p>Adam had never been to a banquet of this size and level, but here, he felt much more comfortable than watching a theatrical production in which he was not interested.</p><br><p>Here was everything that Adam loved so much, delicious appetizers, drinks both alcoholic and not, as well as good company in which he felt cozy.</p><br><p>Adam could feel the eyes of other people on him, someone was looking at him out of curiosity, or maybe someone wanted to talk to him, but didn't dare to approach.</p><br><p>For him, it had already become something common, as for any Phantom who had been on this path for some time and passed a lot of dangerous situations, which became quite famous.</p><br><p>But... one man's gaze he still couldn't detect for some reason, even though that gaze was directed at Adam for a long time now, from the very beginning.</p><br><p>Moreover, Max hadn't shown any signs of alarm either, so... somehow, that person remained in the shadows to their senses.</p><br><p>Still, it was hardly something they needed to worry about.</p><br><br><p>Light, lofty yet confident footsteps sounded from the side, still as imperceptible to their target.</p><br><p>As soon as the figure came into motion, a multitude of gazes were directed at one point.</p><br><p>It was a man with long purple hair falling from his shoulders, his eyes were the same color as Tron's, amethyst, deep and enchanting like gems. His skin was smooth and clean, and his facial features were sharp and attractive.</p><br><p>He wore a long purple mantle, loose, with silver trim around the edges and wavy layers of fabric closer to his arms and waist level. Loose black pants with two platinum straight lines transitioned seamlessly into black sandals strapped tightly around his feet.</p><br><p>On his left hand were two rings, no gemstones but engraved, and in his right ear was a single earring with a gray square stone.</p><br><p>The tips of his hair fluttered slightly as if the wind wanted to give him its attention, and the wine in his crystal glass swayed from side to side, coating the walls like crimson waves.</p><br><p>Only when the scent of his perfume was perceptible did Adam and Max finally realize that someone was heading their way.</p><br><p>Turning around they were greeted by a slight, sophisticated smile that contained some sort of invisible threat.</p><br><p>"Good evening, gentlemen." The man uttered before casting his gaze at Silvana and Lona, "And ladies."</p><br><p>Lona was taken by surprise by his appearance, she couldn't take her eyes off him, his beauty just captivated her. But, with Silvana, such a trick didn't work, at least not completely, she moved on to analyze.</p><br><p>'He's handsome, very handsome... his appearance is almost androgynous, long purple hair and the same eyes... A majestic aura directly emanates from him in a powerful flow. Ah... I see... but what does he want?'</p><br><p>Silvana glanced at the man who bowed slightly, only towards Adam, ignoring the others.</p><br><p>"My name is Franz Balo, such a pleasure to meet you." Franz said in a sweet voice before turning around slightly.</p><br><p>With a deft movement of his hand, he took the wine glass from the waiter's tray, holding it between two fingers before providing the glass to Adam.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter, would you be so kind as to have a drink with me?" Franz said with a smile on his face, but the commanding tone in his voice was audible.</p><br><p>Adam was stunned, it was as if he was hypnotized as his hand reached forward, accepting the glass from the mysterious stranger.</p><br><p>Franz's words raced through Adam's mind as he finally found something to latch onto.</p><br><p>"What? Balo...? Franz Balo? Are you one of the Twelve Branches?" Adam pronounced, holding his glass tightly.</p><br><p>Franz smiled slyly, lifting his chin slightly.</p><br><p>"Yes, I am. I am the third son of the Balo Family, the main branch. But, I don't think the boring details of my status are of any interest right now."</p><br><p>Franz's sharp gaze swept over them.</p><br><br><p>Then, before anyone could say anything Franz clinked his glass against Adam's, raising his hand which made Adam follow his movements.</p><br><p>At the same time, Franz pointed his left hand at Lona, palm open.</p><br><p>"Here's to the young actress! You can be proud beautiful lady, I was pleased with your show."</p><br><p>No one bothered to refuse Franz, his acting was too fast, smooth, and somewhat experienced.</p><br><p>Silvana couldn't decline as Adam joined Franz, and Max was in the same situation since Lona was flattered by his praise.</p><br><p>Moreover... they all kept Franz's status in mind since they were in the eighth wing.</p><br><p>The Balo Family was one of the Twelve Branches and the main family in the eighth wing, there was no one more influential in this part of the First Wing.</p><br><p>Adam was taking a sip of wine like everyone else when Adam decided to ask a question: "So... You don't mean to say that you approached us out of pure curiosity. What's more, you know my name." Adam narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>Franz may have cleverly slipped into their conversation like a snake, but Adam realized it couldn't be that simple.</p><br><p>Franz's corners of his lips curved up in a sly grin.</p><br><p>"Sure, but..." Franz glanced at Lona and Max, "With all due respect, this conversation should only take place between Phantoms."</p><br><p>Franz waved his hand, causing his mantle to quiver in front of Lona's wide-open eyes.</p><br><p>"Young lady, I hope you don't mind if I steal them away for a while for a very important matter?"</p><br><p>Lona only shook her head silently.</p><br><p>That was enough as he stepped aside, to a table at the far end of the hall where it was now empty, and it seemed no one was going to go there.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana glanced at each other before following him.</p><br><br><p>Franz stopped after a few steps, looking over his shoulder at Max with an ambiguous smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Had our meeting happened a little later, this conversation would have involved more Phantoms, wouldn't it?"</p><br><p>Max frowned but didn't say anything. It was obvious that Franz either knew too much or had exceptional insight or both.</p><br><p>Reaching a table away, Franz leaned on the top and waved his hand.</p><br><p>"So, what are the odds in your opinion?" Franz said nonchalantly before glancing at Silvana, "Operator, you can talk too, right now your opinion matters."</p><br><p>It seemed that Franz was rude, but he wasn't obligated to act kind and gentle with Silvana like Adam. To society, she was the Operator.</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>"Hm? What are you talking about? If you want to ask something then say it straight, no riddles, otherwise we'll waste a lot of time."</p><br><p>Franz smiled, picking up a cherry covered in caramel from the table.</p><br><p>"Oh, value your time? That's commendable, but you're not the type to use every minute to do something. You spend weeks or even months to do one thing that can outshine hundreds of others." Franz uttered with a shrug before swallowing the cherry with pleasure in his eyes.</p><br><p>Silvana took a deep breath, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><br><p>"Adam, he's talking about the wedding."</p><br><p>"What?!" Adam's eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>Silvana frowned, staring intently at the relaxed Franz.</p><br><p>"I realize he has ways of finding out about this, but... I don't know why."</p><br><p>Franz smirked, leaning nonchalantly on the table, his elbows dropping on the wooden edge.</p><br><p>"So what's the bottom line? Do you think you can beat a Phantom at the limit of the W0?"</p><br><p>Franz stretched his hand forward towards the ceiling, looking up at the brightly shining chandelier.</p><br><p>"This wedding is very important to the Rouzet and Marzo Family, they will do anything but find a real monster among the Phantoms loyal to them to not just defeat you, but destroy you."</p><br><p>His voice was calm as if he were talking about trivial matters, but Adam and Silvana realized that this was serious stuff. Ruining the plans of two great families while not standing above them in the hierarchy was dangerous.</p><br><p>"I'll win. I've been losing too much lately." Adam said confidently, clenching his fists tightly.</p><br><br><p>"Obviously, I'm thinking the same way. Adam, no, my Phantom will defeat any opponent the Marzo Family puts up."</p><br><p>Franz smirked before turning to Adam, casually raising his hand.</p><br><p>"Hey, Adam, you want to raise the stakes a bit?"</p><br><p>Franz seemed satisfied with the answers he received, though... it hardly mattered, as he had made his decision quite some time ago.</p><br><p>Adam became wary, his eyes narrowing.</p><br><p>"Raise the stakes? What the hell are you talking about? I don't know why you're trying to interfere in this case, but I only made a promise to Osana. Once I win in The Rule of Power, then I'm not going to deal with the nobles anymore." Adam waved his hand, showing that this was the final decision.</p><br><p>Franz nodded silently, Adam's words didn't embarrass him in the slightest.</p><br><p>"Good, strong position, but my suggestion is better. Adam, how about you perform in The Rule of Power from the Balo Family part?"</p><br><p>"No." Adam gave a quick reply.</p><br><p>But... no negative emotions appeared on Franz's face again.</p><br><p>"Wrong answer. Come on Adam, I can offer you something the others are just incapable or rather... they are just not interested in it since they are stupid."</p><br><p>Adam frowned, sensing that Franz was managing to continue their conversation even after two direct rejections.</p><br><p>"Hah, money? Artifacts? Status? I'm not interested in any of that, after the wedding, I'm going back to Dead Lands to kill monsters."</p><br><br><p>"Well... I'm not talking about you. What about the slums and the safety of your family?"</p>
