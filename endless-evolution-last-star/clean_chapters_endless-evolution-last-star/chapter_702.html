            <br><p>Clang. Clang. Clang.</p><br><p>Powerful blows, one after another rained down on the Blind Commander, colliding with the cold blade.</p><br><p>However, whereas before the Blind Commander only took a few steps back, now he had to leap all over the spire platform, practically running away from Adam when the pressure became too much.</p><br><p>The Blind Commander noticed something and the same thing happened to Silvana.</p><br><p>'No... Something's wrong...' Silvana muttered to herself, watching the fight closely.</p><br><p>She saw how much harder the Blind Commander had become, how active the shaking on the sword was, and how many sparks flew off to the sides as they clashed.</p><br><p>'Adam got stronger, but... I'm sure it's not just his new Nexus, he changed on his own...'</p><br><p>There was one thing that Silvana couldn't see even with shared sight, as she was too far away, many kilometers from the battlefield.</p><br><p>However, the Blind Commander was only a few meters away from Adam, and he could clearly feel Adam's aura growing.</p><br><p>It wasn't that the longer Adam fought the stronger he got, it was more like a powerful torrent of water trying to fill the river mouth that was suddenly much larger than it was just a few seconds ago.</p><br><p>When the water reached the edge it would stop growing, yet the question was not when the water would stop when the aura would stop growing, but why it was happening in general.</p><br><p>Unlike Silvana, who hadn't even realized that something was wrong with Adam's aura yet, it was already obvious to the Blind Commander.</p><br><p>As was the inner observer who had taken part in Adam's transformation.</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree's powerful voice dispersed through the inner space, observing the Two Walls.</p><br><p>[After all... You are part of the same trial... you are separate... but you are one...]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree watched as the hands from the First Wall gradually disappeared, returning to a calm state.</p><br><p>The Second Wall was in a similar situation, its shards returning to their place, eager to assume their former appearance.</p><br><p>They had something in common - the rips on the surface, from dark hands, and the Desire Star ripped from the depths.</p><br><p>This resulted in a lot of dark particles coming out - the energy of the path Adam would follow a little later.</p><br><br><p>[They seem to define the strength of Phantoms like K2W0 to K2W2, but... right now even I can't tell exactly what level Adam is at...]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree's words were true, this was the consequence of the incident and the Blind Commander was feeling it to the fullest.</p><br><p>[He took ten steps forward... took the stone from the finish line and went back... but... the fact that he was ahead beforehand doesn't allow him to be that far away anymore...]</p><br><p>After a few seconds, the Evolution Tree continued:</p><br><p>[I don't know if my prediction is accurate... but... I don't think Adam is even nine steps back... it's like seven or even six steps... an actual leap in the path of power due to unique events.]</p><br><p>The Two Walls will return to normal, the Second Wall will soon be in seal and the First Wall will be waiting for Adam to meet his opponent.</p><br><p>However, it was impossible to change the events that took place, nor was it possible to regain some of the power that the Two Walls had lost by prematurely giving it to Adam.</p><br><p>All to appease his desires.</p><br><br><br><p>The Blind Commander blocked another punch, but he felt a second one coming from above.</p><br><p>This time it was different, Adam's fist was shaking, filling with crimson energy like an evil flame wanting to destroy everything in its path.</p><br><p>The monster made his decision instantly as he stomped his foot on the ground, using the same move as last time.</p><br><p>A dense wall of ice appeared between them, separating Adam from his target once again.</p><br><p>But... there was no fear or disappointment on his face, only a fiery grin full of desire to fight, believing in his strength.</p><br><br><p>Shards of ice flew aside, the crimson fist shattering the wall into large pieces, scattering them to the side.</p><br><p>It seemed that neither Adam nor Blind Commander expected this, it was just that one of them believed it and the other didn't.</p><br><br><p>Adam exclaimed happily.</p><br><p>"Your ice is no longer a problem for me! I'm a problem for you now!"</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, the Blind Commander did a backflip, dodging Adam's rushing fist.</p><br><p>However, Adam was fast enough to keep up with the Blind Commander's retreat, getting closer and closer to the edge of the platform, until...</p><br><br><p>The Blind Commander's back slammed into the pillar, stopping him at the worst possible moment.</p><br><p>In an attempt to remedy the situation, the Blind Commander swung his sword, trying to defend himself, but it was too late.</p><br><p>The fist smashed into his face, following a crimson energy blast.</p><br><br><p>The cracks ran through the previously indestructible black stone, the pillar that was the only support for the Blind Commander fell apart, falling with the crushed monster.</p><br><p>A joyous smile quickly replaced Silvana's shocked expression.</p><br><p>'Hah, yes! Now that was a strike! I'm sure that was the hardest Adam's punch ever!'</p><br><p>Her joy was not unreasonable, since she was sure that the Blind Commander would regain consciousness not soon after such a powerful blow.</p><br><p>'Well, we shouldn't be too optimistic, we need to think realistically.'</p><br><p>Silvana inwardly sighed.</p><br><p>'Even if he recovers soon he won't have any other option but to climb the spire like Adam did.' Discover exclusive content at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><br><p>With a loud crunch, the Blind Commander grabbed his head turning it to put it in the correct position.</p><br><p>Then, without wasting a second, he looked around at the wreckage of the pillar falling down with him before taking action.</p><br><br><p>In lightning-fast shadow, the Blind Commander jumped away from the wreckage using it as a platform to get back up.</p><br><p>He succeeded, flying over the edge.</p><br><p>But... Adam was already waiting for his opponent, his arms crossed over his chest and his fists clenched.</p><br><p>"Hah, I was sure it wouldn't be that easy with you. You only have your legs left, right? In that case, it's time to call it a day."</p><br><p>With a smirk on his face, Adam's eyes sparkled.</p><br><p>Then, his rings changed, the crimson fire disappearing, replaced by a purple one, as well as the purple veil running down his body changed to a crimson one.</p><br><p>His rings, his new Nexus, could work in two modes.</p>
