            <h4>Chapter 1026: Power of Fire</h4><br><p>Due to the horrendous power difference between Arnoth and Adam for most of the battle, until the finale, Lone Blaze was unable to contribute enough to the victory. Her ability wasn’t strong enough, given Moira’s crisis, there was almost nothing she could do.
</p><br><p>However, now, she had a lot more room and opportunity in Adam’s Initial Gene, thanks to Moira’s departure and Adam’s increased strength.
</p><br><br><p>Lone Blaze appeared in front of Silvana, giving her a slight smile.
</p><br><p>"It’s been a while, right? Lone Blaze purred. "Since the last time we met, you’ve changed a lot."
</p><br><p>Silvana nodded weakly.
</p><br><p>Their first encounter with each other wasn’t the most pleasant experience for Silvana. However, when she realized that this was her and the Evolution Tree’s plan everything fell into place.
</p><br><p>"Sure, if it wasn’t for your clue, Adam would have most likely lost to the Crimson Monarch. I’m willing to thank you for that as many times as it takes."
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze shook her head.
</p><br><p>"You don’t have to. I just did what I had to do. After all, we all depend on Adam. If he dies, the same thing will happen to us, for some physically, for some mentally. Either way, it would be a disaster."
</p><br><p>Then, she glanced at Silvana’s right arm, or rather at its absence.
</p><br><p>"You know. This is the second time Adam has fought against a powerful enemy, and each time, you have something to lose."
</p><br><p>"Well, it’s not something that bothers me much." Silvana shrugged nonchalantly as she waved her left hand. "This form I’m in right now... It’s incredible. It’s nothing like yours, though I thought I’d be just like Lost Light."
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze chuckled briefly, covering her mouth with the palm of her hand. "That’s not surprising. Silvana, you’re not an artifact like me, you’re an Operator."
</p><br><p>"Yeah, but... something’s been bothering me." She glanced up, staring intently at the Evolution Tree and her sprout. "Will I one day become a part of you?"
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the Evolution Tree answered instantly.
</p><br><p>[Don’t be ridiculous, Silvana...]
</p><br><p>"Agh..." she gasped.
</p><br><p>[I gave you the Evolution Seed, not because I want to absorb you or put you in Lone Blaze’s place... On the contrary, you helped me become stronger... Only you, as Adam’s Operator, could turn a tiny part of my energy into a powerful sprout.]
</p><br><p>After a few moments, the Evolution Tree continued.
</p><br><p>[This is why the fifth gate required the presence of both of you. That’s why it takes two of you to use the Imaginary Cut...]
</p><br><p>Silvana was speechless. She had never received such direct praise from the Evolution Tree.
</p><br><p>[Sure... I’m still the one who holds all of Adam’s power, part of it became Lone Blaze, temporarily, Moira, and you. I can’t create new powers... but you can...]
</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Silvana hummed thoughtfully. "In the end, no matter what we do, it’s up to Adam, isn’t it?"
</p><br><p>[Yes. Each of us may have a different weight on situations and opportunities, but... Adam is our sun, and we are just planets orbiting around it. Some closer, some farther away, but all in the same solar system.]
</p><br><p>"I see... What a strange feeling. Except for you, the Evolution Tree, I’ve been with Adam since the beginning, the only one, but only now do I feel like I’ve become his partner for real. Like... Not just with his heart or mind, but with his energy as well."
</p><br><p>[Everything is as it should be.]
</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, Silvana smiled.
</p><br><p>She was completely fine with the situation she was in.
</p><br><p>For a moment, her mind filled with Arnoth’s last words. She needed to learn more about the Dark Shore, Hollow, and New Waves, and especially the Lords.
</p><br><p>She quickly dismissed those thoughts. She didn’t want to think about it right now. It had only been a few minutes since the battle had ended, she and Adam needed to rest.
</p><br><p>But, before that, there was one thing she had to finish.
</p><br><p>"So..." Silvana turned to Lone Blaze. "What exactly did you want to talk to me about?"
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze looked confused, scratching her cheek awkwardly. "How can I tell you this... Moira’s gone, Adam’s gotten stronger, so I’m only taking up 30% of Adam’s Initial Gene right now of what I can afford to take up."
</p><br><p>"And? What’s stopping you? As far as I know, Adam is giving you a third and Moira 1/3 each of his Initial Gene. Considering how much stronger he became after the destruction of the Crystal Gates, you can now take more space than you and Moira had combined."
</p><br><br><p>Lone Blaze’s corners of her lips went up as she bowed slightly.
</p><br><p>"I need your permission for that, Silvana."
</p><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana frowned.
</p><br><p>"What?" she raised an eyebrow irritably. "You have permission from the Evolution Tree and most importantly, from Adam. I’m sure you do not need mine."
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze’s expression stiffened.
</p><br><p>"Hah..." she giggled nervously. "I didn’t think you’d realize it so quickly. I just wanted to avoid an awkward moment, but you just leave me no other choice."
</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, Lone Blaze looked at Silvana with complete seriousness. Her eyes were deeper than ever.
</p><br><p>"I want to hear your approval. I plan to use the energy of all three of you, Adam’s, the Evolution Tree’s, and yours to create something new, relying on Adam’s Initial Gene."
</p><br><p>"Hah. Trying to maintain a hierarchy?"
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze shrugged. "Yes. I’d prefer to call it a chain of command, but it doesn’t change the point much."
</p><br><p>"Alright, you have my approval. I’m sure you’ll be thinking for a long time about how you let Adam down at a crucial moment. It wasn’t your fault, it’s Moira’s situation, but it wouldn’t help me to get rid of such thoughts."
</p><br><br><p>Then, Lone Blaze’s eyes shone brightly as she turned into a fiery star, disappearing into the Initial Gene.
</p><br><p>Soon, a bright flash of fire illuminated the entire inner space, sending amber waves along the vast darkness.
</p><br><p>Silvana stayed there, watching the scene that only Adam had ever witnessed.
</p><br><p>Now, she could see him grow stronger with her own eyes.</p>
