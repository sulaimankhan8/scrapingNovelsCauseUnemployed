            <br><p>For many spectators, it was good news that Adam managed to find the strength to keep fighting - especially showing them all something new.</p><br><p>By nature, every spectator wanted the fight to be colorful and eventful, as quick victories with a clear advantage for one side were boring and short-lived.</p><br><p>Osana was also a spectator, but first of all, she was the one Adam was fighting for, he was acting in defense of her interests since he was her fighter.</p><br><p>She had been desperate a while ago, but now the confident smirk was back on her face. She stood on the edge watching not as her fighter fought, but as Adam was winning. For Osana, now, this was the inevitable outcome.</p><br><p>"Hah, looks like my desperate screams managed to reach his mind." Osana's corners of his lips went up.</p><br><br><p>Silvana walked over to her, casting a hard, annoyed look at her, her eyebrow raised.</p><br><p>"Don't get cocky. This time, you're completely wrong."</p><br><p>"Agh...? What the hell are you talking about Silvana?"</p><br><p>Without delay, Silvana pointed at Adam, who with a stoic posture was smashing the last stones with quick, confident movements.</p><br><p>Then, his silhouette shuddered, ending up next to the wall where he threw Fromund away. A bright flash of flame blinded everyone for a moment - the next thing the viewers saw was two flashes, the red one and the crimson one, fighting each other with their last efforts.</p><br><p>"He didn't do it for you. I can see it in his gaze and... You can recognize it too, can't you?"</p><br><p>Osana didn't understand what Silvana was trying to convey.</p><br><p>But... once she immersed herself in observing the clashes between Fromund and Adam, it all became clear to her.</p><br><p>The joy remained, but Osana's face grew darker and the smile disappeared completely.</p><br><p>"I see... His gaze, so cold and serious, but not like a soldier ready to follow orders but like a warrior willing to fight."</p><br><p>Instead of confirmation of her words, she only heard Silvana's harsh voice:</p><br><p>"No, as a warrior fights Fromund. Adam fights like a knight or rather like a..."</p><br><p>Suddenly, a shadow appeared behind the two girls, as if it came from hell at the command of the head demon.</p><br><p>"Or like a monster, right?"</p><br><p>Before they could turn around, Gladius's hands fell gently on their shoulders, trying to convince them that there was nothing to be afraid of, but it only made it scarier.</p><br><p>Osana and Silvana exchanged glances, flinching at Glaidus's sly smile, calm but alarmed at the depths of their hearts.</p><br><p>"Well done Operator. You have proven once again that Adam was not wrong to choose you, staying with you despite your issues. You have a chance to go further..."</p><br><p>Even though Silvana was an Operator and knew a lot of things, Gladius's words sounded to her like complicated riddles she couldn't solve.</p><br><p>Osana became indignant:</p><br><p>"Like a monster? Are his movements and attacks similar to a monster's? He fights as a knight, Silvana is right, brutal, bloodthirsty, but a knight, not a monster."</p><br><p>Letting out an eerie chuckle, Gladius waved his hand, returning to his seat.</p><br><p>"I know you're not used to being wrong, it really happens rarely with you, Osana De Rouzet. But... I do it even more less often."</p><br><p>An ominous tone as darkness tried to engulf Osana, but soon she was relieved.</p><br><br><p>The crimson sword stabbed into Fromund's right leg, slicing through his flesh right down to the bone, streams of dark blood rushing out as bright pain reflected on Fromund's face. Your adventure continues at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><br><p>His hand clenched tightly around the black hilt, thrusting the spear into Adam's chest where the blade of his sword appeared at the last moment.</p><br><p>"To hell with this! I'll just burn you! Or even both of us!"</p><br><p>With a belligerent howl, Fromund went for the risk - using his First Order once more, already the third for their fight. For K2-Phantom, it wasn't a serious problem, but considering how exhausted Fromund's body was it was a severe blow.</p><br><p>Flames covered his arm, quickly traveling all over his spear and lashing out at Adam in a powerful blast of fire.</p><br><p>The shockwave threw them both aside, showing the viewers Adam's burnt chest and shoulders, skin charred in many places, black jets of smoke flying upwards.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh... "</p><br><p>Fromund was breathing heavily, he had enough strength to get up off the ground, but... he didn't know if he was ready to continue their high-speed confrontations.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam was in no hurry. He rose slowly, feeling the lingering pain from his burns, before stepping to the side...</p><br><p>At first, Fromund as well as the crowd thought he was going to choose a convenient position to launch an attack, but soon enough everyone realized where, or rather what Adam was aiming for.</p><br><p>A black, charred due to too high temperatures human right arm was lying on the ground among the dust.</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam picked up Fromund's arm that he had severed previously before bringing the roasted flesh to his mouth.</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Fromund's body, his eyes wide with both horror and shock.</p><br><p>"No way... Are you going to...?"</p><br><br><p>Teeth driven by powerful jaws sank into flesh, two long fangs plunged deeper tearing the fibers apart.</p><br><p>With a sharp movement, Adam ripped off a large chunk of flesh, swallowing it, almost without chewing.</p><br><p>There was nothing crazy or beastly about his actions, but... people didn't do that either, at least not for the sake of getting stronger.</p><br><p>"Well, well, did I turn out to be right?"</p><br><p>Gladius's predatory voice reached Osana's ears, making her flinch.</p><br><p>"You know, the Steel Knight and... the Plague Reaper who killed all your mates are not like wild beasts or mindless killers. They're fast, precise, clever, and brutal. However, they are monsters - some of the most dangerous in their level."</p><br><p>Kogen watching Adam's actions was amazed, his eyes went wide in disbelief and an unknown delight filled his entire mind.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Once Fromund's flesh and blood were consumed, Adam's aura intensified and his crimson energy became denser.</p><br><p>The thick chain trembled, channeling all the energy to the sword like a vein running blood.</p><br><p>Silvana blinked a few times, she thought she'd seen this somewhere before, but... in separate events rather than a single entity.</p>
