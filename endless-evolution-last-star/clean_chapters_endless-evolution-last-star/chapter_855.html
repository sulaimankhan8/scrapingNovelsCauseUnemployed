            <br><p>For a while, Adam stared at Silvana as if mesmerized, before nodding deeply.</p><br><p>"Yeah... She's beautiful..."</p><br><p>He wasn't shy, that was his opinion, but Silvana wasn't as resistant.</p><br><p>As soon as his words were spoken her colors splashed across her face. Her serious image crumbled the moment she turned away, waves of shame one after another hitting her.</p><br><p>Tapping her cheek, Misa smiled predatorily intently studying Silvana's new appearance and her reaction to Adam's words.</p><br><p>"You can't argue with that. However, when Goran and I work together, it's impossible to get any other result than success."</p><br><p>A short chuckle erupted from Adam as he threw his head back:</p><br><p>"Hahaha, maybe you're right. I didn't want to end up at the Twilight Palace at all, but I don't regret taking advantage of your help and skills."</p><br><p>With a short pause, Misa nodded.</p><br><p>"Agh, that is understandable, especially considering your fight, or rather how quickly it ended. Unlike the nobles, for them, defeats are almost worse than death, you're not interested in winning at all."</p><br><p>"Well, I just want to get out of here. I can't help it."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly, stood up, and walked over to Silvana taking her hand.</p><br><p>In silence, she turned, meeting his gaze.</p><br><p>"Once again I am convinced that I made the right choice that day. Having you as Operator was not fate, but pure luck."</p><br><p>Before Silvana could say anything, Adam tugged her arm and left the store. The fight, the new clothes, and hairstyle, it was important, but Adam couldn't forget the hunger growing inside him.</p><br><p>After all, it was only the energy from going to K3-Level that kept him upright, otherwise, he would have fallen without strength a long time ago.</p><br><p>Watching their leaving figures, Misa bit her lip remembering Adam's words.</p><br><p>"It wasn't fate, but pure luck?" Hah..." Misa's corners of her mouth went up, "If someone told me such a thing then I felt like a treasure. I wonder if he's on purpose or if his tongue is always so sweet like that."</p><br><br><p>After a few minutes, when the embarrassment let go Silvana returned to her role as Adam's Operator and the one who skillfully found information and made a plan for any location.</p><br><p>She looked at the map, choosing a restaurant for them, at the Twilight Palace, the restaurants were one of the most common places, there were dozens of them, and all different.</p><br><p>It was no surprise, after all these restaurants didn't operate at a loss. Sure, everything was free for the Phantoms in the north part thanks to the twilight coins, but someone had to fund the Twilight Palace.</p><br><p>Obviously, it was mostly the first four great families who did that, since the first wing was their territory. These families had a limitless supply of money, not even a thousand of the most luxurious restaurants could spend a tiny fraction of their fortune.</p><br><p>For an ordinary person, especially not from the First Ring, the opportunity to visit such places would be a great fortune, but for the nobles, it was always the standard.</p><br><p>They thought of their accomplishments, status, position in the family, and power, everything else was irrelevant.</p><br><p>Silvana paused, scrutinizing the available options.</p><br><p>"Hmm... There are meat restaurants, fish houses, vegetarian restaurants, different cuisines, and more," she looked up, "What do you think?"</p><br><p>Scratching the back of his head, Adam looked around. For some reason, there was no one in the passageway. Spiro was the only Phantom they'd encountered. This part of the hotel was empty.</p><br><p>"I don't think I want anything in particular right now. I'm hungry, and any food will do for me, I'm sure it's delicious everywhere here."</p><br><p>Silvana nodded, a few swipes and she found what they needed.</p><br><p>"There is one restaurant in the very center of the northern part of the Twilight Palace, the Amber Cloud. It's the largest restaurant of all, and that's true for their menu."</p><br><p>Streaks of text and pictures reflected in Silvana's eyes as she tried to reach the end of the menu.</p><br><p>"Damn... There are hundreds of items."</p><br><p>Adam smiled widely, leaning over to Silvana to see how to get to Amber Cloud - without a map, this place was a maze.</p><br><p>"Hah, that's what we need, isn't it? It doesn't matter what to eat, as long as it's nourishing and nice!"</p><br><br><p>As soon as they got closer to the center, Phantoms one by one began to get in their way. It wasn't a horde or an endless swarm, but there were dozens.</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that not all of them were from the four great families. Sure, it was common for such families to have a large number of children, and quite a few of them would become Phantoms, but it was still only four families, there couldn't be thousands of people within them.</p><br><p>At the Twilight Palace, there were representatives of other families from the Twelve Branches, as well as members of other noble families. After all, there were far more noble families than the twelve, it was just that their influence was almost imperceptible.</p><br><p>At the same time, commoners such as Adam hadn't yet been noticed by him.</p><br><br><p>Adam inwardly muttered, looking at the people sitting at the tables and moving towards the stores.</p><br><p>'There are definitely a lot of nobles here, it's clear from their faces and gait, but... why don't I see anyone like myself? I'm mistaking them for nobles?'</p><br><br><p>Silvana touched his shoulder, a slight concern reflected on her face.</p><br><p>"Is something wrong?"</p><br><p>"No, there's nothing wrong. I'm just not used to this place yet. Not that I want to, though."</p><br><p>Then, he waved his hand, heading towards the Amber Cloud.</p><br><p>"Come on, I'm bloody hungry."</p><br><br><p>The Amber Cloud was huge, so Adam and Silvana easily found themselves a free seat where there weren't too many people around.</p><br><p>The waiters were ready to take each guest's order, soon one of them would come to their table, they just had to wait a bit.</p><br><p>Watching the Phantoms eating the culinary masterpieces, Adam soon noticed that everyone seemed to have a sudden loss of appetite.</p><br><br><p>One nobleman after another set aside their cutlery, looking to the north and south sides of the restaurant.</p><br><p>"No fucking way..." Adam muttered in a low voice.</p><br><p>Two silhouettes moved towards each other, a girl and a young man, their menacing stares showing the conflict between them that could only be resolved in one way.</p><br><p>"Argh..." Adam grunted, his arms crossed over his chest, "I just wanted to eat... Is that so much to ask?"</p>
