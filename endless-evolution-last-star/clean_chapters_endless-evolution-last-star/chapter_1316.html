            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1316: Energy Axis (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Adam had a lot of work ahead of him, but at least he had a plan of action.</p><br><p>He had to recover, learn about the Desire of Beyond, and find the Dark Heart. That way, he would create the Second Grand Star and get closer to forming his own Constellation.</p><br><p>The plan was not the simplest, and there were a few unknowns for Adam, but at least he knew he would move forward and nothing could stop him.</p><br><p>At least that was the case until now.</p><br><p>“WHAT?” Adam exclaimed in disbelief. “I can’t become stronger?”</p><br><p>Karso spread his arms and shook his head.</p><br><p>“Don’t yell like that. I didn’t make these rules. I’m just telling you what’s going on here.”</p><br><br><p>After another sip, Misty nodded. “Yes, unfortunately, Karso is too stupid to come up with something like that even if he had the chance.”</p><br><p>Karso’s eye began to twitch as he narrowed his eyes dangerously.</p><br><p>“Hey, Misty, don’t make me lose my temper in front of our guest.”</p><br><br><p>“I’m just telling the truth. But, Adam, Karso is right. You are both weak and strong right now because you have a lot of energy, more than you’ve ever had, but you can’t absorb it, and it’s all because of the state of your Energy Axis.”</p><br><p>“But why does it work that way?”</p><br><p>Misty waved her hand as a stream of purple energy soared above the table. Gradually, it split into many threads that turned into a single dense line, more like the handle of a staff than a simple streak on the ground. It had volume and shape, simple on the outside but extremely complex on the inside.</p><br><p>“This is how the Energy Axis should be, straight and steady, so that energy flows unimpeded from start to finish, responding to your will during battle.”</p><br><p>She leaned over and touched the beginning of the Energy Axis with her fingertip. A bright impulse flashed along the entire line before disappearing.</p><br><p>“At the same time, if the Energy Axis is exposed, it presents itself as a real mess.”</p><br><p>She waved her hand as a multitude of threads scattered in different directions. Now, this Energy Axis that Misty used for demonstration looked the same as Adam’s, differing only in color.</p><br><p>“That impulse will not only weaken, but in most cases will not even be able to reach its final goal, that is, to fulfill your will.”</p><br><p>Leaning forward, she touched the base of the Energy Axis again, but this time the impulse only reached a third of the way when the many separate threads took all of its power, ultimately turning it into nothing.</p><br><p>Karso nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“You know, it’s like wires that carry electricity. If the wire is poorly made, from unsuitable material and dirty composition, then the energy transfer will be terrible, if it can even reach the end at all, with huge losses.”</p><br><p>After a while, Adam sighed, processing the new information.</p><br><p>“I see. I understand how the Energy Axis works. I need a direct line for the energy to flow from start to finish, not a brush floating around in my inner space. Pffft, no wonder I feel so helpless. My energy is disappearing at the very beginning.</p><br><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, staring intently at Misty.</p><br><p>“I don’t understand one thing. Why did I only learn about the Energy Axis now? I didn’t have these problems before, and no one warned me about them. Could it be that the Energy Axis was in perfect condition all this time and only now decided to break down? It all sounds very suspicious, doesn’t it?”</p><br><p>Misty tilted her head and blinked several times. It was impossible to tell what she was thinking from her ghostly look.</p><br><p>“Isn’t it obvious? A month ago, when you fought Ureyn, the Energy Axis didn’t exist.”</p><br><p>“Agh…?” Adam was puzzled.</p><br><p>“It didn’t appear to make your life more difficult, but it was because your Evolution Tree and body could no longer handle the load you were taking on. The good news is that you’re not unique. Everyone goes through this.”</p><br><p>Thoughtfully touching her lip, she continued:</p><br><p>“Imagine a large, four-story building. It stands strong, and even a hurricane cannot destroy it. However, gradually, builders add one floor after another, constantly increasing the height, and fill the empty floors with heavy furniture and equipment. Gradually, the weight increases until the foundation simply cannot withstand it, and as a result, the house collapses.</p><br><p>“Right now, you have become just such a building. Your foundation can no longer bear the load. So, to avoid the complete destruction of the entire house, it is necessary to either strengthen the foundation or put in supports, beams, and so on. The Energy Axis is precisely that support that was forced to appear so that you would not break completely.”</p><br><p>A flood of information suddenly overwhelmed Adam, but remembering the cracks in the bark of the Evolution Tree, he immediately understood what Misty meant.</p><br><p>“Got it. So the Energy Axis is not a curse, but an evolutionary mechanism. After all, the Evolution Tree grows for a similar reason. If that didn’t happen, all the energy inside would burst out and destroy the inner space.”</p><br><p>Misty nodded calmly.</p><br><p>“Correct. You could say that the Evolution Tree handles the volume, while the Energy Axis is needed to control the pressure. Your Energy Axis is in this state precisely to distribute the pressure so as not to harm you.”</p><br><p>She glanced toward the bedroom.</p><br><p>“Who knows, maybe if it weren’t for the Energy Axis, you wouldn’t have woken up and would have died on that bed. Although that fate would have awaited Karso and me in our time.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply. Now he understood that Karso’s words were not mockery, it was reality and a serious matter.</p><br><p>“The Energy Axis prevents the pressure from harming me, but because of that, I have become weaker than ever.”</p><br><p>Karso waved his hand carelessly. “Yeah, that’s a side effect, everyone knows that. Nothing serious, you just have to rebuild it.”</p><br><p>Adam’s gaze deepened. “How am I supposed to do that?”</p><br><p>In response, Karso grinned.</p><br><p>“Oh, for that, you’ll have to reach the limits of your powers and then go beyond that. Sounds good, doesn’t it?”</p>
