            <br><br><p>Full of strength and fighting spirit, Adam quickly followed the blue arrow. Unlike the flaming thread that ran along a prearranged path, the blue arrow was freely oriented in space.</p><br><p>The arrow created a unique trajectory for Adam, taking into account the surface and curves of the caves, as well as the fact that Adam could not walk on the walls.</p><br><p>Following the arrow, Adam pondered with a deep gaze:</p><br><p>'Hmmm... Did I miss something in the courtyard? I've only explored a small part of it since I stumbled upon the purple sphere, so I'm not surprised, but... something tells me there's more waiting for me.'</p><br><p>In a few leaps, Adam found himself at a cave leading high up, he hadn't noticed it earlier as he simply didn't care to turn in that direction, so he followed the flaming thread.</p><br><p>The cave was sloped only slightly, but it was enough for Adam to climb quickly to the top like a mountaineer.</p><br><p>In the Wild Lands, the rocks were strong enough to hurt Phantoms and monsters as well, but Adam's physical strength didn't change in any way.</p><br><p>It would be difficult for a normal person to climb dozens of meters up a practically sheer wall, only someone trained could do it, but for Adam, it was no more difficult than jumping on the ground.</p><br><br><p>His hand gripped the edge as he found himself at the top of the cave. Following the blue arrow some more, Adam ended up in front of a wide wall just like the one in the courtyard of the fortress.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Don't tell me you want me to destroy it. I'll spend a good deal of energy on it." Adam glanced at the blue arrow hovering in front of the wall.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the arrow turned sharply and poked at the wall several times, as if trying to do Adam's job.</p><br><p>Yet, no action was actually required of Adam.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Cracks went down the wall as four long arms showed out.</p><br><p>Adam flinched, he realized what was happening - the wall was the Stone Mimic, but not the usual one.</p><br><br><p>With a loud creak, the four arms pushed against the edges before stepping forward separating themselves from the wall for the first time in a very long while.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Two powerful legs trembled, straightening up and lifting Stone Mimic almost to the top of the cave.</p><br><p>Unlike its weaker fellows, this Stone Mimic not only had four arms and a more intimidating appearance but also a large eye above a wide jaw.</p><br><p>"Damn... I take it this is Prime One, right?" Adam suggested staring intently at the passage guardian.</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply.</p><br><p>'Yes... but something's not right. Usually, the Prime Stone Mimics are distinguished by their size and the presence of an eye, but that one... has two extra arms and looks much stronger.'</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly as his gaze traveled to the wall, the open passageway that used to guard the Prime Stone Mimic.</p><br><p>"Well, that just means he's the strongest among the strong. And... now I see why I needed the flame thread to get here."</p><br><p>If Adam hadn't defeated the Solitary Commander, he theoretically had a chance to reach the three statues.</p><br><p>However, to do so, he not only needed to somehow find out that there was a secret passage behind the wall, but he also had to beat the Stone Prime Mimic, who seemed no weaker than the Solitary Commander.</p><br><p>"Hah, sometimes it's good to do things by the rules, but..."</p><br><p>Adam's easy grin changed to a cruel one in a moment.</p><br><p>"It won't last forever. You only follow the rules because you're not strong enough to bend them to suit you."</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Ignoring Adam's words, the Prime Stone Mimic moved aside, a muffled shudder echoing with every step he took.</p><br><p>Undeterred, the blue arrow tore forward.</p><br><p>Adam cast a glance at the Prime Stone Mimic and followed the arrow.</p><br><br><p>As soon as he entered the courtyard of the fortress, the Prime Stone Mimic returned to the wall, becoming a part of it.</p><br><p>'Hmm... If I didn't know there was a secret passage here, I never would've thought that there was a cave down behind this wall.'</p><br><p>Glancing around Adam didn't see anything remarkable, it was the same courtyard of the fortress as on the gate side.</p><br><p>The blue arrow flew next to Adam, gradually guiding him forward, making him go higher and higher up the narrow stairs.</p><br><p>The Shadow Walkers and the Dark Watchers were in their places, wandering around the fortress. The only thing that had changed was the light of the torches - they grew much brighter as the sun went completely below the horizon line.</p><br><p>Soon, the moon would take its place, and it was only minutes away.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, four streams of flame erupted beside Adam, purple with runes floating on top.</p><br><p>Naturally, this attracted the monsters' attention, they weren't going to give Adam any of the runes, it was a valuable resource for them.</p><br><p>Adam realized this too, so he immediately prepared for battle.</p><br><br><br><p>A bright blue light reflected in his eyes as the arrow soared between him and the monsters. The Dark Watchers and the Shadow Walkers immediately stopped.</p><br><p>Arrow trembled slightly before turning to Adam, poking him in the chest, and heading for the nearest stairs leading upstairs.</p><br><p>Slightly confused, Adam took a few steps back before ascending to the next level. Find adventures at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>A few seconds later, the sounds of battle resounded behind him. The Phantom was no longer a threat, but the Shadow Walkers were numerous enough to fight over the runes, they wanted to get stronger like everyone else.</p><br><p>Adam didn't turn around, he knew perfectly well what was going on from the sounds.</p><br><p>'Hah, I'm afraid there's no point in me joining them, I have a whole other goal in mind, right?'</p><br><p>Stopping at another bend, Adam looked up.</p><br><p>For a while he walked higher and higher following the blue arrow, not giving much thought to his final goal.</p><br><p>"Damn... One in the courtyard, one in the caves, and one here..." Adam gulped.</p><br><p>His deep eyes were focused on the great spire hidden in the shadows, towering not only over Adam and the monsters but over the entire fortress including the four towers.</p><br><p>A faint, pale blue glow emitted from time to time from the top of the spire, inviting whoever was worthy to see the Wild Lands in all its glory and take the third battle.</p>
