            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1376: His Desire</strong></p><br><p>For Adam, defeating the Silver Weaver was crucial, not only because it determined whether he would receive the Desire of Beyond, but also because, over the course of the battle, the Silver Weaver had become an important enemy for him.</p><br><p>Adam understood well that if he had not defeated the Crimson Monarch, Plague Reaper, or Arnoth, he would not be who he is today.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver had deprived him of all paths to victory except his own.</p><br><p>Sure, the Silver Weaver also had the same ability, but Adam was confident in himself because this was his last chance.</p><br><p>So, now Adam would either be able to suppress the Silver Weaver’s path or lose, since neither he nor Silvana would be able to continue the fight after everything that had happened.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The space trembled from two powerful auras, white and silver, even the dark dome was unable to withstand their full power, which the Silver Beacon and Mona noticed from the top of the gray tower.</p><br><p>“What is this…?” The Silver Beacon muttered as she watched the dome tremble, almost bursting from the aggressive light inside.</p><br><p>Mona gulped, she felt that everything was being decided right now. Not only did Adam’s fate depend on it, but possibly hers as well, since the White Spire was involved.</p><br><p>“Tsk. I don’t know what’s going on there, but I hope that little bastard doesn’t get out of there alive! He will die on this island, and everything will return to its previous state.”</p><br><p>The Silver Beacon was annoyed that she couldn’t influence the outcome of events in any way. She had to hope that Adam would make a mistake.</p><br><p>But… Deep down, she felt that the outcome would not be what she had hoped for.</p><br><br><p>The only one who remained calm at that moment was the Silver Weaver.</p><br><p>Adam’s energy poured down on him in powerful waves in an attempt to destroy his path.</p><br><p>“Come on! Just a little more!” Adam exclaimed inwardly, seeing that neither his path nor the Silver Weaver’s was going to budge.</p><br><p>Even after a few seconds, neither of them had moved an inch.</p><br><p>Numerous wounds, exhaustion, and loss of energy were taking their toll on Adam’s condition.</p><br><p>Particularly painful was the fact that they seemed to be completely equal.</p><br><p>‘Damn it! Are none of us capable of defeating each other?!’ Adam’s eyes darted around, observing the strange scene.</p><br><p>With every heartbeat, shock waves emanated from their collision, gray sand flew away along with pebbles, exposing empty ground, and even the tar lake in the distance trembled before their combined power.</p><br><p>Still, they both remained unshaken, or… Only one of them?</p><br><br><p>Over time, Adam’s situation worsened. He was breathing harder, and everything before his eyes began to blur, indicating his serious exhaustion.</p><br><p>For him, it was pure torture, as he was forced to maintain his previous level of strength even though it was becoming increasingly difficult and painful to do so.</p><br><p>Did the Silver Weaver see this?</p><br><p>Sure, such an obvious detail could not escape his keen eye, but he did not feel joy at the impending victory, as everything was being decided at that very moment.</p><br><p>“Adam, hang in there! Just a little more! His energy can’t be infinite!” Silvana’s voice rang out in Adam’s mind, but he could barely make out her words.</p><br><p>“I’m trying, really, but…” Adam flinched as his grip weakened. “My strength is coming to an end…”</p><br><p>It was true. There was no energy left from Silvana’s ability, blood was flowing freely, and numerous wounds were making themselves felt.</p><br><p>Silvana tried to support him. However, for several seconds, Adam couldn’t hear her.</p><br><p>Everything was plunged into darkness, but his body continued to fight actively.</p><br><p>Thump… Thump… Thump…</p><br><p>His heartbeat slowed, his breathing became heavier, and his grip finally began to weaken.</p><br><p>The silver energy of the Silver Weaver began to overwhelm Adam gradually. He didn’t have enough strength to deal with the Silver Weaver, who stood against Adam almost unscathed, with only a few scratches.</p><br><p>At the same time, there was a gap in Adam’s heart, his body and mind exhausted, and darkness had almost consumed him.</p><br><p>“Is this… Is this really the end?” Adam muttered inwardly, looking at his hands. His fingers had long since lost their strong grip and were ready to slip off the handle of his needle at any moment.</p><br><p>Neither Silvana, nor Evolution Tree, nor Lone Blaze was able to reach his soul, which was ready to plunge into eternal oblivion.</p><br><p>After a few breaths, he would stop resisting, and then the Silver Weaver’s energy would simply wipe him out.</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly, ready to accept his defeat. He knew that this moment would most likely come one day, although he did not want it to happen this way.</p><br><p>But before that, he wanted to fulfill his last wish, and he raised his gaze.</p><br><p>In the darkness, two green eyes were looking at him, calm and completely confident.</p><br><p>Adam’s breath turned as the darkness thickened around the Silver Weaver’s face until only his eyes remained visible.</p><br><p>Soon, the green eyes began to change, their rich color becoming softer and brighter, resembling Adam’s blue eyes until they became his copy, a reflection of himself.</p><br><p>Something changed in Adam’s mind at that moment, as he used all his strength to grab the hilt of his needle.</p><br><p>“No…” Adam whispered, his voice hoarse, on the verge of death. “I’m not going to lose. I can still fight…”</p><br><br><p>For the first time in their entire battle, Adam stepped forward as cracks ran across his needle.</p><br><p>Although the Silver Weaver still looked like the favorite in their battle, it was Adam who was stepping forward.</p><br><p>“I… have enough strength left for a few more steps… I will take them… Because it is me… Because it is my desire…”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes shone brightly as his gaze became fierce.</p><br><p>“I want to defeat you!” He exclaimed with blood gushing from his throat, desperately and proudly.</p><br><br><p>In an instant, their frames shook as their paths finally decided which of them was stronger.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver moved to the left and Adam to the right. Everything happened as it should have from the very first moment of their collision.</p><br><br><p>Blood gushed from Adam’s side as his needle shattered into dozens of fragments, not only the blade but also the hilt.</p><br><p>It wasn’t just that his energy was depleted or his body was wounded. No, it was much deeper than that.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>Cracks covered the Branch Crystal at the top of his Evolution Tree. This was where his Branch Order, his two needles, and the path were located.</p><br><p>The Branch Crystal was not destroyed, but Adam’s desire to win proved to be more than the Branch Crystal could withstand. Adam would no longer be able to use his Branch Order, at least until he restored the Branch Crystal or created something new to replace it.</p><br><p>Were all these sacrifices worth it? Did Adam get what he wanted? Did he defeat his old enemy?</p><br><br><p>Adam collapsed to the ground as blood rapidly flooded the gray sand beneath him. His chest rose and fell in gasps while his pierced heart desperately tried to beat despite being submerged in blood.</p><br><p>At the same time, a cold gust of wind swept past the Silver Weaver, ruffling his thick black hair as the ends swayed in front of his calm blue eyes.</p><br><p>Unlike Adam, he had not suffered any new wounds, his needle had not been destroyed, and even his energy level was still high enough to fight several Elders and emerge victorious.</p><br><p>However… when the Silver Weaver turned to look at Adam, he saw a slight smile on Adam’s face.</p><br><p>He was dying, but he was smiling.</p><br><p>“So you finally understand, don’t you?” The Silver Weaver asked, slowly stepping towards him.</p><br><p>Blood flowed from the corner of Adam’s mouth as he choked.</p><br><p>“Of course… But I must admit, it turned out to be much more difficult than I thought. You destroyed me. You forced me to use all my abilities, resort to Silvana’s help, and even throw my trump card, my path, against you…”</p><br><p>A chill ran down Adam’s spine, but he had no intention of stopping, for the fire burned brightly in his eyes.</p><br><br><p>The Silver Weaver approached Adam, his shadow falling over him. He towered over Adam, but there was no hostility in his eyes.</p><br><p>“After all, what else did I expect when fighting against my future power?” Adam smiled. “Right?”</p><br><p>In response, the Silver Weaver nodded slightly and gripped his long, white needle tightly with both hands, as if it were a great sword.</p><br><p>“It just shows how strong you are, Adam. You found what you deserved. Your Desire of Beyond possesses great power, and I am the most important proof of that.”</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, the Silver Weaver thrust his needle straight into Adam’s chest through the guard.</p><br><p>“Now that you understand everything, it’s time to take me back. Make me part of your power.”</p><br><p>Adam glanced at the Silver Weaver before closing his eyes and diving into his inner space.</p><br><p>“As you say. Even the Desire has its wishes, doesn’t it?”</p>
