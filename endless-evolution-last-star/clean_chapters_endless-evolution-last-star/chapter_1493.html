            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1493: Red Ear</strong></p><br><p>“Help from the queen?” Adam blinked several times. He wasn’t sure he had heard correctly.</p><br><p>Queen Elisa was the most mysterious Phantom Adam had ever met. Even though she was a human and a Phantom just like him, Adam still couldn’t accept the fact that someone like her actually existed.</p><br><p>Not only was she the reason why the Citadel was able to survive the World Wipe, at least the First Ring, but Adam was certain that Queen Elisa was one of those who started the entire civilization as he and millions of other people knew it.</p><br><br><p>“The method I’m about to tell you can be used anytime, anywhere, and in any condition, but it would be foolish not to take advantage of Queen Elisa’s help when you have the opportunity.”</p><br><p>In fact, Queen Elisa had helped Adam once before. It happened when he needed to create the Second Key. If he had done everything the standard way, it would have taken him a thousand years to connect all the stars and create the form for a key.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam figured out a way to speed up the process significantly, but when he was under the influence of Queen Elisa’s aura, only then did events take a new turn.</p><br><p>Time practically stopped, and through battles against his past opponents, such as the Plague Reaper, Adam was able to create the Second Key fairly quickly.</p><br><p>He didn’t know if it was Queen Elisa’s special ability or the effect of her aura that covered her in the very center of Heaven Island. Still, he spent several years fighting monsters until he created the Second Key.</p><br><p>Now, Beth suggested that he return to Queen Elisa and seek her help.</p><br><p>“Wait, wait, wait!” Alexia exclaimed. “You want me to go through that strange state again? When I left Heaven Island, I looked like a mummy! I had to eat like a pig for a whole month to regain my weight!”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>“I see, so Alexia went through something similar? Douglas said that usually the effect shouldn’t be so dramatic. If Alexia, like me, had to connect thousands of stars, and considering her temper… Huh, I don’t blame her for choosing the same option as me. I would do it again if I had to.”</p><br><p>Beth shook her head.</p><br><p>“As I said, Queen Elisa’s help is not a requirement, it never was one. But it will save you a lot of time and make things much easier for you. Look, you’ve both become quite strong since we last met. I can’t deny that. But…”</p><br><p>Her green eyes darkened as a grim aura momentarily emanated from her like a dark flame.</p><br><p>“Do you even realize how big the difference is between you and Queen Elisa? If she were on the battlefield instead of acting as a shield for the entire Citadel, she would only have to walk past you for her aura to turn your flesh and bones into bloody mincemeat.”</p><br><p>Adam and Alexia exchanged glances. Such a fate did not frighten them, as they understood that Queen Elisa was their ally, a friend to every living human. If not for her, even the First Ring would not have been able to withstand the World Wipe.</p><br><p>“Ahem,” Louis coughed. “From what I understand, Adam and Alexia themselves must figure out where they can get their conditions, and to do that, they have a tool, right?”</p><br><br><p>Louis continued. “To do this effectively and quickly, they need the queen’s help, but if that weren’t an option, they could do it themselves as well.”</p><br><p>Beth nodded again as she jerked her head toward Louis.</p><br><p>“Smart man, that’s what you two fools are missing.”</p><br><p>“Pffft!” Adam snorted and crossed his arms over his chest. “I understood everything right away. I just hoped for a different outcome, but this isn’t bad either. How long do you think it will take us to figure out where our conditions are?”</p><br><p>Beth paused as her eyes darted to Adam and Alexia.</p><br><p>“Without Queen Elisa’s help, it would take from a few days to a few weeks, but with her help? You’ll figure it out in seconds.”</p><br><br><p>Silvana touched Adam’s hand.</p><br><p>“I think we should go to Heaven Island. We’ll save time, and it would be foolish to miss such an opportunity.”</p><br><br><p>“Nothing is interesting there. Trust me, just the queen and a bunch of squads from the Gamma Division pretending they have a lot of work to do.”</p><br><p>“Huh!” Alexia chuckled. “Maybe that’s true for you. How many times have you been there? How old are you anyway? Hmm?”</p><br><p>She leaned forward with a broad grin, hovering over Beth.</p><br><p>“I’m sure you’re too old even to be my great-grandmother!”</p><br><p>Damien would probably just laugh at such words, but Beth was a different case.</p><br><br><p>Beth grabbed Alexia by the ear and pulled her sharply to the side, as if punishing a disobedient child who had forgotten her manners.</p><br><p>“Ouch! Oh! Shit! Let me go!”</p><br><p>Alexia tried to break free, but in response, Beth only twisted her ear until it turned red. Alexia gritted her teeth from the burning and pain, but she couldn’t do anything. She wasn’t stupid enough to attack Beth.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a cold gust of wind came from the balcony, rushing over the table.</p><br><p>Beth turned just in time to see Damien and Adam’s family heading towards them. He, Leona, and Gary were carrying bags of groceries, mostly drinks and alcohol. Trici, in turn, had several boxes of sweets and cans of soda.</p><br><p>Leona was against Trici eating too many sweets, but when Trici and Damien started persuading her, she had no chance.</p><br><br><p>Damien waved his hand, ignoring the fact that Beth was still holding Alexia by the ear.</p><br><p>“I guess they already figured it out?”</p><br><br><p>“Yes. I did everything.”</p><br><p>She replied, but still did not release Alexia from her iron grip. She wanted Alexia to suffer a little longer.</p><br><br>
