            <h4>Chapter 1355: Breaking the Rules</h4><br><p>Adam fought enemies with various abilities along his journey, and lightning was no exception. Among them were two particularly formidable monsters that controlled the power of thunder — the Prime Thunder Demon and Bathild.
</p><br><p>This was the main reason why his artifact got its name — the Dual Demon Sword.
</p><br><p>Adam used his artifact for the first time only when fighting Ureyn, before that, he had no reason to do so. However, even then, he showed only one side of his weapon, realizing that he was not ready to use its full power.
</p><br><p>Well, on that day, Adam only needed one part of the Dual Demon Sword to defeat Ureyn. However, now he was faced with a situation where he simply needed the full power of the sword to survive.
</p><br><p>No one expected this, not the Crystal Golem, not the imps, not Silvana, and not even Bertrada, who was sure that Adam would lose because staying on the ground was too dangerous.
</p><br><p>However... Now, Adam was soaring high in the sky with two dark wings spread wide on his back. When he used the first form of the Dual Demon Sword, he also had wings of blue lightning, but they were hollow, and the main power came from the exoskeleton and electricity.
</p><br><p>Moreover, he could freely use lightning and thunder at any distance to attack his enemies both from afar and up close.
</p><br><p>Now, everything was different.
</p><br><p>"Agh..." Adam sighed deeply, ignoring the explosions of cannonballs far below him.
</p><br><p>He stared at the Crystal Golem, but shook his head and looked away.
</p><br><p>Despite its large size, the arena of the second trial was essentially a square. On one side was the Crystal Golem, while on all the others were the imps with their glass cannons.
</p><br><p>’Even from this distance, I can feel how weak their auras are. These imps are only here to shoot at me with their cannons. They are incapable of fighting me, unlike this golem.’
</p><br><br><p>The imps sounded the alarm, pointing at Adam hovering in the sky as they hurriedly began to load their cannons. They knew what would happen to them if Adam got to them, and given the situation, it was only a matter of time before that happened.
</p><br><p>"GHOOOOOO!" The Crystal Golem roared furiously as it made its second throw, sending dozens of shards flying toward Adam, cutting through the wind.
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam paid no attention to this. When the time came, he would fight the Crystal Golem and surely win, but right now, he had other priorities.
</p><br><p>"Alright, you’ll be the first..." Adam muttered as his frame shook.
</p><br><p>Instead of flapping his wings or creating an explosion behind him to accelerate, he simply disappeared.
</p><br><p>"Ghra...?" The red imp looked around, trying to understand what had just happened.
</p><br><br><p>With a creaking sound, Adam’s silhouette appeared right in front of the little monster as their eyes met for a moment.
</p><br><p>Then, Adam raised his sword high above his head, and instead of attacking the imp, he brought his sword down directly on the glass cannon.
</p><br><br><p>The glass shards flew in all directions, frightening the imps, as the cannon broke under minimal pressure. Even a much weaker Phantom or monster could easily destroy them.
</p><br><p>It seemed that this was the path to victory for those who were unable to fly up like Adam did. It was possible to destroy all the cannons from below with arrows, shots, or flaming projectiles, but that was not quite the case.
</p><br><p>Adam turned over his shoulder as he frowned.
</p><br><br><p>He looked at the diamond net covering the transparent barrier that surrounded each pillar, providing virtually impenetrable protection against the cannons.
</p><br><p>However, Adam’s lightning leap was powerful enough to break through the defense.
</p><br><p>"Well, I don’t know if the Silver Beacon created these trials for me or something else, but it was wrong to believe that I couldn’t fight in the sky. This trial will be much easier than the first one."
</p><br><br><p>More than ten imps aimed their pitchforks directly at him with menacing looks. They cautiously moved forward, wanting to surround him.
</p><br><p>"Seriously?" Adam raised an eyebrow, not believing his eyes. "If you want it so badly, I’ll fight you."
</p><br><br><p>Adam made a powerful stomp as dark electrical discharges ran across the surface.
</p><br><p>This was enough to make the imps throw down their pitchforks and run away, hiding in the far parts of the pillars.
</p><br><p>Adam shrugged, looked at the next cannon, and disappeared in an instant, reappearing next to it.
</p><br><p>Each leap cost him a lot of energy, but given the circumstances, it was the fastest and most effective method of dealing with the glass cannons.
</p><br><p>The Crystal Golem understood this, but he could do nothing but watch as Adam destroyed one cannon after another. The imps fled in fear from his aura as he disappeared and reappeared in a dark flash, quickly getting rid of all the glass cannons.
</p><br><p>In just a minute, only three glass cannons remained, and all the imps hid at the edges of the arena, afraid that after the cannons, Adam would decide to attack them.
</p><br><p>Sure, the Crystal Golem could throw shards at Adam in the hope of hitting him, but that would be very foolish on his part, as the shards would definitely hit the glass cannons too and destroy them.
</p><br><p>"Adam... Your energy, the second form, is burning it at an enormous rate," Silvana muttered worriedly.
</p><br><p>He nodded deeply, smashing the penultimate cannon with his fist.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, I know that. Don’t worry. By the time I run out of energy, I’ll have passed this trial. Besides, we still have quite a few tricks up our sleeves, don’t we?"
</p><br><p>Unexpectedly, Silvana smiled slyly and nodded.
</p><br><p>"Sure. Wings are just a tool, but we still have many powerful weapons that no one has ever seen, including the Silver Beacon."
</p><br><br><p>With another swing of his sword, Adam destroyed the last cannon, standing in the middle of the empty pillar.
</p><br><br><p>He looked at the Crystal Golem on the other side of the arena.
</p><br><p>"We can fight fair, big guy. Come down, or I’ll bring you down myself!"</p>
