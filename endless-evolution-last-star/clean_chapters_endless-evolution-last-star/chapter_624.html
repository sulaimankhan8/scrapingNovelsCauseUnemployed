            <br><br><p>Every Phantom had an Operator, except for Rookie Phantoms, but if they didn't die in the first few weeks and completed a couple of missions, they got a partner as well.</p><br><p>This applied to K0-Phantoms as well as Second Rank Phantoms such as Damien, Frida, or Erden. Operators were a necessary part of any Phantom's life and there were reasons for that, which only those who reached a certain stage of evolution found out about.</p><br><p>And even a person like Gladius, who had a special position in the Citadel because of his work, was no exception to this rule.</p><br><p>Like all male Phantoms, his Operator was a woman, and if not for her strange aura and scales as well as her energy-filled tattoos, she would be no different from a human.</p><br><p>"Crown Type monster...?" Zarot gulped, his eyes wide open.</p><br><p>Deep inside him, terror and fear appeared, but he just didn't notice it because of his shock.</p><br><p>From the very first second he saw Xyrea, he sensed that there was something wrong with her, her aura was different from that of a human. An experienced and strong Phantom like Zarot could sense this on an intuitive level.</p><br><p>Xyrea peered at Zarot, while Gladius lurked behind her, only his ocean-blue eyes shining in the darkness were visible.</p><br><p>"Yes, you heard right. I am a monster, and I am much stronger than you, I think you've already realized that by my aura which is only a fraction of my strength."</p><br><p>"How...? How is that possible? Fuck!"</p><br><p>Animal rage filled Zarot's eyes, not because of the kidnapping but because of the realization of what Gladius was doing inside the Citadel.</p><br><p>"You! You are not human! You are a demon who has come from the underworld! A human and a monster working together? No! It's even worse, much worse!</p><br><p>How could you make a monster your Operator? You should be executed, eliminated for this!"</p><br><p>His anger quickly turned into hatred for Gladius, pure and sincere. After all, Zarot was a Phantom first and foremost, before nobility and his other statuses. He slayed many monsters in his lifetime and saw them ruin the fates of others.</p><br><p>A slight smirk appeared on Gladius's face as his eyes sparkled.</p><br><p>"Well, I'm not a demon or monster, I'm human, unlike my Operator. Were you wondering how our alliance came to be? Hah, if Xyrea doesn't mind telling you, in this case, we have nothing to worry about."</p><br><p>Zarot sensed that there was some secret meaning in Gladius's words, but his mind was too focused on the fact that Xyrea was a monster.</p><br><p>Folding her hands in front of her, Xyrea spoke calmly:</p><br><p>"Many years ago, Gladius defeated me. However, he didn't kill me immediately, something attracted him to me. Realizing that there was no way I could defeat such a powerful being and I didn't want to die, I decided to take the risk and offer complete submission in any variation."</p><br><p>Then, Xyrea took a step to the side with a wave of her hand, pointing at Gladius.</p><br><p>"Properly speaking, the relationship between us is slave and master. At least that's what I thought at first."</p><br><p>There was no lust, indignation, or humiliation in her words as she fully believed what she was saying and meant it to be true. After all, Xyrea was a monster, and their understanding of how the hierarchy was set up was simple and straightforward, somewhat different from the human perspective.</p><br><p>"For a long time, I couldn't understand why Operator and Phantom are considered equal partners. It makes no sense since Phantoms are stronger than Operators, the stronger one should rule."</p><br><p>Xyrea was silent for a brief period as if pondering her own words.</p><br><p>"But... in my long time living among humans, I have begun to slowly understand the concept of an equal partnership between two beings of different strengths. Though... it's still strange to me why I, as the weaker one, have the right to be on equal terms with Gladius."</p><br><br><p>At that moment, Gladius approached her from behind, gently taking the locks of her purple hair in his hands and taking a deep breath.</p><br><p>"Agh... Even without perfume, you smell beautiful, no makeup, lipstick, or creams are needed for you. You're always in your peak form, intimidating, cold, and beautiful."</p><br><p>Xyrea answered nothing. She had heard compliments from Gladius many times over the years and from other men as well, after all her body was in perfect condition, tall stature, and an enchanting confident look.</p><br><p>However, she never responded to the compliments. Not because she didn't like it or was disgusted by it or didn't want attention from her Phantom, she just didn't understand the purpose.</p><br><p>Appearance was important, and Xyrea didn't deny that, but only if appearance was an indication of a creature's power.</p><br><p>And... Gladius knew that well, he had ways to embarrass even a monster.</p><br><br><p>Read new chapters at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Gladius's hands found themselves on Xyrea's sides, pressing down on her protective scales, slowly sliding his palms upward.</p><br><p>"Even in your half-form, your scales are so strong and flexible, true perfection, I'm sure even the strongest Phantoms would have a hard time destroying your defenses."</p><br><p>Such a strange compliment was the first thing that somehow resonated with Xyrea, her lips curved, and a slight blush appeared on her face just like a normal girl. Even her gaze changed with a bright glow of confidence.</p><br><p>She was pleased to hear Gladius say that, not just because he was a man and her Phantom, but because he was stronger than she was, much stronger.</p><br><p>Then, Gladius stepped aside, keeping his back straight, the shadow falling showing only half of his face.</p><br><p>"Well, I think that's enough. After all, there's nothing wrong with telling him our story before he dies." Gladius said nonchalantly.</p><br><p>Zarot's eyes went wide from Gladius' last words.</p><br><p>"What...? What did you say?"</p><br><p>They glanced over, Xyrea demanding permission, and Gladius nodded silently.</p><br><p>Taking a step forward and leaning slightly, doing everything by the book and formally like any experienced Operator, stated:</p><br><p>"Mr. Zarot Marzo, you are already dead. It is your family's decision and we will be your executioners."</p>
