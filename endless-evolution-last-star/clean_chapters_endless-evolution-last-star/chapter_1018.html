            <h4>Chapter 1018: First Crack</h4><br><p>Unfortunately for Lone Blaze, there was no way she could affect the Crystal Gate. Not even the Evolution Tree was capable of doing so.
</p><br><p>Only Adam could shatter the gates and become stronger.
</p><br><p>But Lone Blaze could have informed Adam of her discovery.
</p><br><br><p>Lone Blaze didn’t let the rush of joy stop her from making the right decision. She never did such a thing.
</p><br><p>’No, I shouldn’t talk about it,’ she inwardly muttered, staring at the first crack. ’Adam certainly won’t lose the will to fight, he doesn’t need hope, only purpose. But if he finds out that the gate has started to break apart, then he might relax. I can’t let him miss some attacks because of that.’
</p><br><p>After Adam, Lone Blaze understood best how dangerous Arnoth was. Moreover, she felt inferior in front of Lost Light.
</p><br><p>"She..." Lone Blaze hissed. "If we were to fight 1 vs. 1, she would torch me with a wave of her hand. We’re not equals, and I can’t beat her even if Adam opens his last gate."
</p><br><p>A slight shiver passed through the Evolution Tree as her deep voice rang out.
</p><br><p>[You must not compare yourself to this External Artifact... Like it or not, you are not Adam’s primary partner. He has Silvana... while Arnoth has Lost Light.]
</p><br><p>"B-But! This is stupid! Silvana isn’t as strong as Lost Light! She has a few abilities, but that’s it! At this rate, Adam will lose even with the fifth gate, and... We’ll all die!"
</p><br><p>[Sure... If Adam loses, then it’s all over...]
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Suddenly, Lone Blaze was under intense pressure. Before she could do anything, her knees collapsed and she found it hard to breathe.
</p><br><p>[However... You must never doubt Silvana... It was Adam’s choice... It was my decision to give her the Evolution Seed... If you doubt Silvana, then you think Adam and I made a mistake!]
</p><br><p>On the next impulse, the pressure pinned Lone Blaze to the ground. She felt as if it would take a little longer, and her body would be torn to shreds.
</p><br><p>Before it was too late, the Evolution Tree released Lone Blaze.
</p><br><p>It was a threat that Lone Blaze could not ignore.
</p><br><p>Yet, her gaze was fixed on the fifth gate.
</p><br><p>Soon, a second crack appeared, only she and the Evolution Tree knew about it.
</p><br><p>The Stellar Flow felt that soon it would be able to reach its goal.
</p><br><p>The closer Adam was to the border between despair and death. The smaller his chances of escape, the stronger the Stellar Flow became.
</p><br><p>To open the Fifth Gate, Adam had to do what he did best - keep fighting to the last drop of blood and look for every chance to win.
</p><br><p>The only thing that could doom him was that this time it was not up to him alone.
</p><br><br><br><p>Arnoth stepped forward and, in a golden flash, appeared right in front of Adam.
</p><br><p>Shock covered Adam’s face as he jumped back at the last moment.
</p><br><p>"Adam, you can’t escape me. Your speed isn’t fast enough to outrun us!" Arnoth exclaimed when the mark on his chest glowed.
</p><br><br><p>Arnoth’s fist full of light power slammed into Adam’s face from the right. Adam didn’t even realize what happened, he only saw Arnont turn into a shadow and appear beside him.
</p><br><p>The impact threw Adam back into the nearby debris. Several rocks fell on him, trying to nail him to the ground.
</p><br><p>With a wave of his hand, Adam cleared his view.
</p><br><p>His pupils narrowed. Arnoth was already towering over him, clenching his two fists tightly together. Golden streams of energy created a tiny star in his fists, his sun ready to scorch everything in its path.
</p><br><p>As fast as he could, Adam lunged forward.
</p><br><p>He could feel the wind at his back as Arnoth’s fists swept right behind him, unleashing their full power on the ground instead of his enemy.
</p><br><p>For a moment, a flash blinded the entire land of the Fallen Ring Castle, followed by a threatening shuddering of the ground.
</p><br><p>The golden sphere of the explosion sent rays of light in all directions. Hitting the few serpents who dared to get too close to the castle.
</p><br><p>Nothing was left of them.
</p><br><p>The wind currents threatened to throw the serpents aside, dropping Grita, Torz, and Risha off the roof.
</p><br><p>"Agh... Missed..." Arnoth muttered, pulling his fist out of the ground.
</p><br><p>He stood on a small hill while a wide crater ring surrounded him.
</p><br><p>Adam stood off to the side, tearing wounds covering his back as drops of blood fell onto the white marble. He couldn’t dodge Arnoth’s attack in time, but if he’d hesitated even a fraction of a second, he’d be dead by now.
</p><br><p>’Fuck. They were simple attacks. He didn’t even use his abilities. I don’t know if there’s anything new in his arsenal, but... The power of his light is frightening.’
</p><br><p>That wasn’t an exaggeration. Adam’s heart began to beat faster because of the onset of fear of Arnoth. He realized that any mistake, even a moment’s delay, could cost him his life.
</p><br><p>Despite his quickened breathing, his grip around the hilt was as strong as ever.
</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.
</p><br><p>Several new cracks appeared on his fifth gates. The Stellar Flow was hitting the Crystal Gates time after time trying to destroy the last obstacle.
</p><br><p>"Adam," Arnoth stepped forward. "Have you ever imagined your own death?"
</p><br><br><p>"Hah, what a dry answer. Well, perhaps you’re right. It’s always better to experience things for yourself, right?" Arnoth uttered in excitement.
</p><br><br><p>Using his palm as a blade, he made a vertical sweep from top to bottom.
</p><br><p>Adam was not prepared for this, yet his legs came into motion without his knowledge, saving him from the light blade at the last moment.
</p><br><p>"Shit..." he looked back to see a wide cleave on the ground, several columns collapsed into the gap.
</p><br><p>Lost Light’s lips came into motion as she muttered something. Adam couldn’t make out her words.
</p><br><p>Arnoth nodded deeply as his expression became more serious.
</p><br><p>"Yes, you’re right," he didn’t notice what she saw in Adam.
</p><br><p>Then, Arnoth directed all his energy to his right hand, gathering golden streams into his palm that soon shone brightly.
</p><br><p>"Adam... We must finish our fight before it is too late. I’m not willing to make a mistake."
</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Arnoth stepped forward, throwing out his palm.
</p><br><p>A bright stream of light swept over Adam as he managed to take only a step to the side on instinct.
</p><br><p>His eyes darted to the left as they opened wide in disbelief.
</p><br><p>The light destroyed his left arm up to the shoulder, he didn’t even feel the pain, losing his chance for victory in an instant.</p>
