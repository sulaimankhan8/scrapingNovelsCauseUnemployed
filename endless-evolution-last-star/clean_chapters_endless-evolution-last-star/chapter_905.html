            <br><br><p>Three Chloe's punches and three blue colors on the dummy.</p><br><p>"Yay!" Chloe exclaimed joyfully as she turned around, "Mr. Erik! I did it! That means I have much more control over my energy usage now, right?"</p><br><p>With a slight smile, Erik tucked his phone away in his pocket, slowly stood up, and waved his hand.</p><br><p>"You tell me. I'm not an Operator, so you should have a feel for what you can and can't do, but..." he glanced at her hands covered in bruises, "One thing is for sure, you and Silvana passed the test."</p><br><p>As soon as his words were spoken Chloe's eyes glazed over. Then, she sighed with relief wiping the sweat from her forehead.</p><br><p>"So, what do we do next? It's only day three of seven, right?" she asked.</p><br><p>"Yeah, all four of you are showing great results." Erik nodded weakly.</p><br><p>He turned around, heading for the exit. However, Julia did not follow him. Now, they had different tasks.</p><br><p>"I'll head over to Adam and Reinz, they need Phantom for their next phase of training. But, this is not the end for you and Silvana, because..." Erik shook his head, he didn't envy them, "For the rest of the week you are at Julia's disposal."</p><br><br><p>Julia approached Chloe, confidently laying a hand on her shoulder. A sly smirk played across Julia's face.</p><br><p>"Get ready girls. I'm not as kind as Erik. He's a Phantom, they're always lenient with Operators, it's inherent in them. But... I won't be so soft."</p><br><br><p>On the morning of the fourth day, right after breakfast which was prepared by Silvana and Chloe under Julia's strict supervision, they split into two groups.</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz went to the arena following Erik. They expected to see what Second Rank Phantom was capable of.</p><br><br><p>Erik clapped his hands and threw off his jacket, remaining in his red shirt and tight black vest.</p><br><p>"Alright, you know what we're going to do now, but first I'm going to show you what the Infusive Energy Control should look like in practice."</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz focused carefully on watching Erik's actions.</p><br><p>True, Adam was fighting against Damien who wielded the Full Energy Control to perfection, but this was happening during the fight and Damien only showed the Outer Energy Control.</p><br><p>Surely Reinz must have once seen Elders or other K3-Phantoms from great families use the Infusive Energy Control, but he didn't know what it was until that moment.</p><br><br><p>Erik stretched his right arm out to the side as his aura grew a little stronger, no... it appeared for the first time in a long time.</p><br><p>'Once again...' Adam narrowed his eyes, 'What incredible aura control. I have a long way to go to get to that level.'</p><br><p>Soon, scarlet energy enveloped Erik's arm moving along his wrist with no intention of stopping. Within seconds, the energy transformed into a long blade with an unusually large guard that hovered around his wrist.</p><br><p>This was no ordinary sword or something like Adam's needle. Erik wasn't holding the blade - his hand became the weapon as the blade became an extension of his arm.</p><br><p>"As you can see." Erik pointed to the scarlet blade, "This is one of my... so to speak abilities... Right now I use nothing but the standard amount of energy needed to create and maintain the blade."</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz nodded, their eyes reflecting the fluctuations of energy that flowed like water along the blade.</p><br><p>Without warning, Erik swung his blade straight in their direction.</p><br><p>Instinctively, Adam and Reinz were about to dodge the attack, but nothing happened. It was no different than a simple swing of a sword. Erik was too far away to attack them.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, you should have seen your faces. A little more and you would have scattered like coward rabbits!" Erik chuckled darkly, pointing his left hand at their tense legs.</p><br><p>Adam grinned, "Hah when you have an attack coming your way from the Second Rank Phantom, it's no fun at all."</p><br><p>Reinz nodded deeply in agreement.</p><br><p>"Well." Erik extended, "Focus. Now, I will channel the energy into the blade. The energy will travel down the arm first, but that won't be the end goal. Imagine you're using the Outer Energy Control, but your target has no physical embodiment as if the energy is going into the air."</p><br><p>Then, Erik's aura shuddered once more as the energy ran down his right arm. It wasn't visible to the eye, but Adam and Reinz could feel it.</p><br><p>Soon, the energy reached his fingertips.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, crimson flame spurted from the blade in a powerful stream. The flame was neither hot nor cold, but it carried a destructive power.</p><br><p>Erik slowly swept the blade through the air.</p><br><p>"The effect of the Infusive Energy Control does not depend on your desires."</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Reinz was confused, his eyebrow raised, "What does that mean?"</p><br><p>"Regardless of how much energy I use, I won't be able to get a different effect on the scarlet blade. I mean, I can't make it longer, bigger, or smaller, or split the blade into three. I think you know what I mean.</p><br><br><p>Erik's eyes grew wide for a moment. Then, the flames became several times stronger, leaving destruction on the solid ground, though only particles touched the surface.</p><br><p>A slight shiver reached Adam and Reinz, passing down their legs and moving along their bodies.</p><br><p>"The power of the flames depends on how much energy I use."</p><br><p>Adam's corners of his mouth went up.</p><br><p>"So, for each ability, there is a certain effect, you can't change that, but the power of the effect depends on you and how well you master the Infusive Energy Control. Did I understand that correctly?"</p><br><p>"Yeah, pretty much yes." Erik nodded weakly, "After that, you will try to do the same thing with your abilities, but... Before that, I want you to see something."</p><br><br><p>They glanced around, expecting Erik to show them something curious.</p><br><p>But... instead, they saw his silhouette shudder, turning into a shadow.</p><br><br><p>Before they could realize it, Erik made a wide swing of his blade.</p><br><p>The wind slash swept between them, smashing into the solid stone slab of the arena with a clatter. Shards flew off to the sides, flying over their shoulders, their gazes shocked and full of fear.</p><br><p>'Fuck...' Adam gulped, 'He didn't use his ability. It was just the wind... just the force of his swing...'</p>
