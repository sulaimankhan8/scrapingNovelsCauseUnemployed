            <br><p>Adam heard of Arnoth many times, of his status as the Crusader of the Lost Light, but he never asked Heret, Vorx, or the others what his mortal enemy looked like. The same applied to Kreyna, but she was not his target, it was Risha's trial before the power.</p><br><p>However, Adam had certain expectations, given the tales of Arnoth's power, his title, and his serene actions in ruling the captured lands.</p><br><p>Heavy, dark amber armor covered Arnoth's body, sharp plates arranged in several layers on his knees, elbows, and especially on his great shoulders.</p><br><p>His helmet, with six short slits separated by a line, fit tightly against his armor, leaving not even a tiny gap through which an enemy could attack his neck - not even a needle could get through.</p><br><p>Golden energy enveloped his great frame, filling even the air around him with power. Space seemed to shudder slightly with every breath he took.</p><br><p>Arnoth was not as big as the light guardians or even the goliaths, yet he was the biggest opponent Adam had to go up against, among the strongest ones.</p><br><p>The Plague Reaper of the Crimson Monarch were about his height, no different from humans and it was no surprise since they were the Crown Type monsters. Arnoth in turn was nearly four meters tall, his arms could hold up multi-ton columns and his legs strong enough to withstand an oncoming storm.</p><br><p>Nevertheless, Adam still had one question.</p><br><p>'Wait...? It all looks intimidating, but why is he a crusader?' he wondered. 'Neither Kreyna nor Arnoth are in the database. They are new, unknown monsters like Kyros, the Crimson Monarch. That means they chose their titles for themselves or earned them in places too far from the Citadel, where other, stronger monsters gave them their titles.'</p><br><p>These were Adam's guesses. To one degree or another, they were pretty accurate.</p><br><p>However, Arnoth was going to torture him with riddles - they had come here to fight, and he was ready to fulfill that task.</p><br><br><p>With a rumble, like a statue that hadn't moved for decades, Arnoth slowly rose from his throne.</p><br><p>Heret stepped back as dark green flames ran down his arms. He was ready to fight right here and now.</p><br><p>But before he could make his first attack, Arnoth raised his hand with an open palm, stopping him.</p><br><p>"Take your time, serpent... First, I want to understand your motivation. Are you doing all this to avenge the queen and king?"</p><br><p>Heret didn't want to talk, but something in Arnoth's aura made him answer.</p><br><p>"Damn right!" Heret shouted, gritting his teeth in anger. "You destroyed my home! You killed my friends! You slayed the king and queen! You came out of nowhere and brought nothing but destruction! I will do anything but rip your heart out of your chest and tear it apart!"</p><br><p>Strangely enough, not a hint of anger appeared on Arnoth's face, he just let out a low, heavy chuckle.</p><br><p>"Hahaha... You... Young Monsters don't realize what kind of game you're playing at all. Although the same could be said for you..." Arnoth glanced at Adam. "What's your name, young man?"</p><br><p>Heret wanted to say something, but Adam beat him to it.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter. You're Arnoth, Crusader of the Lost Light, right?"</p><br><p>Arnoth nodded deeply. "Yes, that is my name and, more importantly, my title. Young monsters like these serpents or other weaklings can't have such a thing... A title is something to be earned."</p><br><p>In his manner, Arnoth was about to continue, expecting to see the same shock on Adam's face as on Heret's, but... Adam wasn't surprised.</p><br><p>This was unexpected.</p><br><p>"Hmm...?" Arnoth grunted, his armor rattling. "Young man, no... Adam Vinter, am I not the first monster with the title you've met?"</p><br><p>Thus, the beginning of a fierce battle turned into a conversation - a revealing of secrets, even if only on the surface.</p><br><p>Even Heret had to stop his righteous anger, despite his desire for revenge.</p><br><p>'What, what is that bastard talking about?' Heret clenched his fists, his flames erupting. 'What does he mean, young monsters? Does he intend to say that he's significantly older than me? No... Is he saying he's older than the queen and king? But... Shit! What is even going on here?!'</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam nodded deeply. He didn't mind answering, talking about his last memorable battle.</p><br><p>"Kyros, or otherwise the Crimson Monarch. I only learned his name at the very end, seconds before he died in my hand. Our fight is my pride, as well as my victory." Adam's eyes were full of determination.</p><br><p>Arnoth flinched as he staggered backward.</p><br><p>"What? You... Your look, you're not lying. But, how?"</p><br><p>Then, Arnoth's voice shifted to a whisper. It was the first time Heret ever saw their invader in such a state.</p><br><p>"The Crimson Monarch... He shouldn't have awakened so early. He should be one of the..."</p><br><p>Abruptly, Arnoth stopped speaking. His posture changed as he put his palm to his chest.</p><br><p>"I apologize, I wasted too much of our time. I think we should get down to what we all came here for, though..."</p><br><p>Arnoth's aura intensified dramatically, causing waves of shivers to pass through Heret's body.</p><br><p>"Only one of you can give me the fight I've been waiting for."</p><br><p>Sure enough, Adam's desire to know what Arnoth was talking about was tearing him up from the inside out. He didn't miss a single word, he listened to everything very carefully.</p><br><p>'Did he know the Crimson Monarch? Did they know each other directly, or was it just that Arnoth knew of Kyros as a powerful monster? Even so... Where did this happen? In the distant lands of the Dead Lands? Shit... the more answers I get the more I realize how many secrets the government is hiding even from a K3-Phantom like me.'</p><br><br><p>Arnoth stepped forward, shaking the ground with his great stride.</p><br><p>He put his arms out to the sides as lines of light resembling electrical discharges emerged from the ground.</p><br><br><p>With a flash of light, in his hands appeared a long, mighty sword and a heavy, round shield made in several layers like a whirlwind.</p><br><p>Now, he was a crusader, not a mere warrior in armor.</p>
