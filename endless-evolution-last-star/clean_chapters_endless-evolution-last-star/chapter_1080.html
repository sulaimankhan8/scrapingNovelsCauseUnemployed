            <br><p>Chapter 1080: Shadow Hail (Part 2)<br>
The young wing monsters were right about something.</p><br><p>Hunting down the K3-Phantom and the Twilight Crystal was not the main purpose of the trial, but at the same time, it was the main reason why all of this happened in the first place.</p><br><p>First of all, Serra, Kenex, and Horon arrived at the Soaring Chain Islands to stop Adam, to prevent a potential Second Rank Phantom from getting the Twilight Crystal.</p><br><p>Saegar was an obstacle and a long-standing problem for the Befallen Crown.</p><br><p>However, the three Earls overestimated their strength. None of them could make Saegar become serious, let alone win.</p><br><p>He didn’t even use his weapons or abilities, only energy. Moreover, all this time, there was still a Kenward in the temple on the main island who would side with Saegar instead of the Befallen Crown side in a critical situation.</p><br><br><p>Saegar gripped Serra’s wings tightly, pressing down harder on her back.</p><br><p>He was about to fulfill his promise to destroy the Arc of each of them. Unfortunately for Serra, her Arc was not a sword or a spear, but the wings that became part of her body.</p><br><p>“Prepare yourself, I’ve had to do something like this a few times, so…” Saegar’s low voice reached her ears like a whispering ghost. “I know it’s going to hurt. Well, you chose this on your own.”</p><br><p>Before Serra could answer anything, there was the sound of tearing flesh.</p><br><p>Her face froze in savage horror as her pupils fluttered with a wave of piercing pain.</p><br><br><p>With a sudden movement, Saegar ripped her wings from her back, a torrent of blood gushing in front of his face, reflecting the bright light of the sun and his exalted expression.</p><br><p>Flesh dangling from veins, slowly fell from Serra’s wings, beneath her trembling, in pain, body.</p><br><p>“AAAAAAAARRRGGHH!!!!”</p><br><p>Her scream, full of agony and attempts at restraint, spread throughout the Soaring Chains Islands, frightening not only Horon and Kenex, who were below, but also Saegar’s men watching the battle from afar.</p><br><p>“Hush, don’t cry out.” Saegar sighed, tossing her wings aside.</p><br><p>Two lines of torn flesh remained on Serra’s back, her heart beating faster than ever in wild terror. Her fingernails sank into the ground in an attempt to escape.</p><br><p>Only now did she realize how big a mistake she had made when she accepted this mission from the Befallen Crown.</p><br><br><p>Saegar ran a hand through his hair, slicking it back.</p><br><p>“You know, it’s not your fault. All the Lesser Lords try to delude themselves into thinking that they are the same as the other Lords, that they are on the same level. But, it’s nothing more than an illusion.”</p><br><br><p>He applied a little more force to his foot, pressing Serra to the ground like a worm trying to escape from under his boot.</p><br><p>“Hey, where are you going? I’m not done yet-”</p><br><p>WHOOSH. WHOOSH. WHOOSH.</p><br><p>With a whistle of the wind, a multitude of shadows descended upon the island like diving falcons, one after another crashing straight into Saegar.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, part of the island turned into a broken wreckage, the shadows becoming a single stream that drove Saegar down, plunging him deep underground in one of the flower fields.</p><br><p>Then, more than ten shadows summoned their weapons, each invoking their Arc, activating their abilities.</p><br><p>The various elements, one after another, descended upon Saegar, turning the place of his descent into scorched earth.</p><br><p>TREMBLE. TREMBLE. TREMBLE.</p><br><p>With each new attack, the tremors grew stronger. The chains linking the numerous islands shook vigorously.</p><br><p>Powerful shadow auras made the wing monsters and even Valdris, who remained in the distance, tremble.</p><br><p>The weaker monsters from the nearby regions shuddered, Rosana, Osmer, and Ivar, who were watching from their bloody lands.</p><br><p>Some worried that after such a devastating attack, Saegar would not be able to continue fighting, would be badly wounded, or would even die.</p><br><p>Others, especially Kenex and Horon, hoped for it.</p><br><p>They had waited for the backup from the Befallen Crown for too long. In fact, the Befallen Crown gathered more than a dozen of the Lords in a fairly short period.</p><br><p>Moreover, some of the Lords of the dozen had auras that were much stronger than the others, yet they didn’t reach Saegar’s and Kenward’s level.</p><br><p>Simply, Kenex, Horon, and Serra lost to Saegar too quickly.</p><br><p>For a while, nothing happened.</p><br><p>A cloud of dust rose high up, hiding Saegar’s silhouette.</p><br><p>The Lords exchanged a glance and bounced back. They didn’t know if they had succeeded in achieving their goal with their abrupt attack.</p><br><p>“We were able to do it…?” One of them whispered, his eyes running from side to side.</p><br><p>The woman gulped. “I don’t know. There should only be bits and pieces left of him after an attack like that!”</p><br><p>One of the older Lords glanced over to the younger one, giving orders to check what condition Saegar was in.</p><br><br><p>The man stepped forward uncertainly as a torrent of wind dispelled the smoke screen, revealing Saegar.</p><br><p>He lay on the ruined ground, blood dripping from his forehead as his empty eyes stared up at the blue sky.</p><br><p>Despite the hope that appeared in the eyes of the Lords, no one was in a hurry to rejoice. They needed confirmation that Saegar was at least unconscious. That would be tantamount to victory.</p><br><br><p>“This…” The man flinched, looking at the motionless Saegar, who wasn’t even breathing.</p><br><br><p>The man’s eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>Saegar was standing right in front of him. Somehow, in the brief instant that he had during the blink, he managed to rise from the ground.</p><br><p>His eyes were no longer empty, only depth was visible in his two ambers as well as the two black, dragon gauntlets covering his arms from elbows to the sharp tips of his claws.</p><br><br><p>Before the man could realize it, Saegar’s hand fell to his face, clutching his head tightly like a vise.</p><br><br><p>Black electric shocks ran through Saegar’s arm as the man’s head exploded, pouring blood all around.</p><br><br><p>Kenward set the glass down on the table.</p><br><p>“This is serious now, right?”</p>
