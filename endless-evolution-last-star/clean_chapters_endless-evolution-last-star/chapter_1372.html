            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1372: You are a disgrace</strong></p><br><p>Usually, when Adam used his trump card, he would win shortly thereafter.</p><br><p>This was not surprising, as trump cards existed for this very purpose. It was the last card a fighter could play, which would either lead to triumph or defeat.</p><br><p>It was rare for a fight to continue after both fighters had shown all their trump cards.</p><br><p>Well, this battle was one of those, because despite their expectations, no one had shown their full strength yet.</p><br><br><p>A gust of wind blew away the smoke screen, revealing the Silver Weaver’s new appearance.</p><br><p>Most monsters at the Black Threat Level, especially the Awakened Ones, who were the Elders for that reason, had two forms at once — a human and a monster.</p><br><p>More often than not, monsters preferred to remain in human form. It wasn’t that they wanted to become humans, but because of the power that Crown Type Monsters possessed at all levels before that.</p><br><p>However, there were sometimes exceptions when a monster would start a fight in its monster form before transitioning to a more formidable state. Adam had already encountered one such opponent, Lyrod, who only transformed in the middle of a fight when the threat of death became real.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver did the same, and now Adam stared at him with eyes full of disbelief. This was not what he had expected.</p><br><p>Two green, calm eyes with round pupils looked at Adam, while a white robe covering a thin body swayed in the wind. The Silver Weaver’s skin was as white as a sheet of paper, in contrast to his nails and long, neck-length hair, which were as black as night. His bare feet stood firmly on the sand, and in his light grip was a long, thin sword more reminiscent of a needle.</p><br><p>In fact, the Silver Weaver’s ability to transform was not unique. Adam would not have been surprised to see this from any other Elder, he just didn’t think that the evolved Silver Weaver had this ability as well.</p><br><p>“Adam…” The Silver Weaver’s detached voice rang out, causing Adam’s heart to freeze.</p><br><br><p>“You are a disgrace.”</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could react, the Silver Weaver appeared in front of Adam as the monster kicked him squarely in the jaw with all his might.</p><br><p>The impact was enough to throw Adam to the other side of the tar lake, crashing into a hill.</p><br><p>“GHA!” Adam spat out a mouthful of blood as waves of pain ran through his body one after another.</p><br><p>He looked up only to see the Silver Weaver striding serenely across the tar lake. He wasn’t walking on water, he was creating fleeting platforms of energy beneath his feet, stepping on air as the Lords did.</p><br><p>“You… What the fuck are you talking about?” Adam shouted, not because of the pain but because of the humiliation.</p><br><p>After all, the Silver Weaver was the source of his power. Hearing from this monster that he was a disgrace was a stinging blow.</p><br><p>“Hmm?” The Silver Weaver hummed. “You must understand my words, mustn’t you? Just look at yourself, what is this? You call this power? Who are you going to defeat with this, a pathetic White Threat Monster?”</p><br><p>Adam gritted his teeth and lunged forward, summoning the Dual Demon Sword while the fifth ring of his Nexus was still active.</p><br><p>Sure, it was a serious strain on his body, but Adam couldn’t help but respond to the Silver Weaver’s words. He couldn’t forgive him for that.</p><br><br><p>The dark sword crashed down on the Silver Weaver, who responded with a single swing.</p><br><p>The white needle knocked the Dual Demon Sword out of Adam’s hand as the Silver Weaver’s knee plunged into Adam’s stomach.</p><br><p>“GAAH!” Adam gasped in pain, but the Silver Weaver wasn’t going to stop there.</p><br><p>He grabbed Adam by the wrist and threw him forward, right where the Dual Demon Sword lay. Adam saw it and tried to grab it, wanting to return to the fight.</p><br><br><p>The Silver Weaver’s foot came down on the dark sword, smashing it into fragments that flew before Adam’s trembling eyes.</p><br><p>The weapon that had helped him defeat Ureyn and easily pass the three trials of the Silver Beacon was destroyed with a simple stomp.</p><br><p>“What now? Go ahead, show me all your pathetic tricks. I have enough patience to see them all.”</p><br><p>Panic spread like wildfire in Adam’s mind, but he knew that the Silver Weaver was right.</p><br><p>‘This isn’t over yet. I have powerful abilities and ways to win!’</p><br><br><p>The disks spun above his hands as the threads headed towards the Silver Weaver. With a cold gaze, he stepped forward, standing in front of Adam, and grabbed his wrists, smashing the disks like glass.</p><br><p>One by one, the Silver Weaver destroyed Adam’s abilities, but… Adam had something else he hadn’t shown his opponent until that moment.</p><br><br><p>Adam jumped back as a powerful aura burst from his body.</p><br><p>“Silvana, we must defeat him, here and now!”</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Silvana appeared to Adam’s right in her spectral form as they were ready to create the scissors.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver’s eyes shifted.</p><br><p>“Oh, now you’ve called your Operator for help? How sweet…”</p><br><br><p>With a gust of wind, the Silver Weaver appeared before them, but his target was not Adam.</p><br><p>‘W-What…?’ Silvana shuddered in fear as she watched the pale hand heading straight for her.</p><br><br><p>The Silver Weaver crushed her head, destroying Silvana’s spectral form as easily as a fragile porcelain cup.</p><br><p>Adam stared in disbelief at the fragments falling to the ground—all that remained of Silvana’s form.</p><br><p>Without her, he could not use any of the abilities of the Evolution Vein.</p><br><p>Then, their eyes met as Adam realized one simple thing:</p><br><p>He had nothing left, not a single ability or trump card, and the enemy before him had not even shown his full power yet.</p><br><p>“You seem confused…” The Silver Weaver said. “Then I’ll have to remind you why you’re still alive and what power is. Enough of these games.”</p><br><br><p>He stepped forward, standing directly in front of Adam.</p><br><p>“You are a Phantom, and you know the rules: fight or die.”</p>
