            <br><p>The appearance of the ice towers could not be predicted by anyone, even for the Blind Sinner, it was not a primary plan, yet they arrived transforming the Fortress of the Lone Serpent into something big and powerful.
</p><br><p>It seemed that to create something so great, the Blind Sinner had to expend a massive amount of energy, which is why he used the archers. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to spend his energy, but unlike him, the archers were no match for the Dormant Lord.
</p><br><br><p>The Blind Sinner walked to the platform’s edge, watching the four great ice, frosty towers connected by chains as thick and heavy as mountains.
</p><br><p>The density of the fog was noticeably higher next to the towers, creating a natural defense, but the poor visibility and low temperatures were not the only obstacles to the monsters’ attempts to remove the ice towers.
</p><br><p>Frosty torrents of wind, like cruel overlords, ran along the towers and chains, accelerating further and further, allowing the tiny ice crystals from the mist to move quickly throughout the area.
</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.
</p><br><p>Everything under the chains was covered with a thick layer of ice, not even ten minutes later there would be clumps of snow several meters high. To some extent, it became an ice border separating those who were closer to the fortress than to the hilltops.
</p><br><p>Wind and frost were powerful weapons in themselves, the monsters unlucky enough to be in the wind’s path received wide cuts like sharp blades, blood gushed from their slashed flesh, but the crimson droplets did not reach the ground before quickly turning into scarlet crystals.
</p><br><p>The mist protected the towers as the powerful energy around them overwhelmed the weakest monsters. They could not even approach the great ice, their bodies trembling with fear not obeying their minds.
</p><br><p>Yet, the Blind Sinner realized that sooner or later the monsters would destroy the towers, especially the flaming ones. That was one of the reasons why he made the four archers use their trump cards. Your next read is at Freewebnovel
</p><br><br><p>The Crown Type monster, stronger and faster than most, engulfed in flames quickly burst into the fog, wanting to destroy the northern tower.
</p><br><p>The new rules didn’t suit him, he needed the past effects of the irregular energy if he wanted to get something decent after taking the fortress.
</p><br><p>Finding himself amid the fog, the monster looked around, barely making out the outline of the foot of the tower. His eyes narrowed as his two flaming daggers flashed brighter, he would need all his strength to destroy the tower.
</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, a long spear pierced his chest, the azure sharp tip gleaming reflecting the millions of ice crystals surrounding them.
</p><br><p>In disbelief, the Crown Type monster turned around seeing another Crown Type monster - a tall maiden in blue armor with long hair as white as snow.
</p><br><p>Her cold gaze was merciless, she would not let anyone destroy the ice tower, at least she would stand to protect the northern one.
</p><br><p>Realizing that he was at a disadvantage, the flame monster stepped forward, the long blade slowly exited his chest. Despite the pain, he did not give up hope of victory and quickly attacked.
</p><br><p>Two daggers flashed towards the maiden’s face, but... something stopped the flame monster at the last moment.
</p><br><p>The beast’s paws with long claws and thick white fur held the flame monster’s arms tightly.
</p><br><p>And... the beast was willing to go much further for the sake of preserving the tower.
</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, the beast clenched its paws tightly, squeezing the flame monster in two with its pure brute strength.
</p><br><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.
</p><br><p>The monster’s bones cracked quickly, breaking under the brute force of the beast. He tried to free himself, but his strength was insufficient and his flames were useless, it struggled to maintain its shape under the brutal cold.
</p><br><p>As a final touch, the maiden swiftly swung her spear, slicing the flaming monster’s head from his shoulders.
</p><br><p>The monsters and Phantoms who saw this scene from outside had eyes full of confusion, they didn’t understand what was happening there and why the monsters started fighting against each other.
</p><br><p>Unlike the Dormant Lord, who had the Diamond Servants, the Blind Sinner had no helpers, which would be strange considering his nature as a creature.
</p><br><p>But, the Blind Sinner was not a stupid monster, like most of the Crown Type his intelligence was above average, in his particular case he was smarter than most.
</p><br><p>The tiny ice crystals in the mist weren’t just a way to spread cold under the chains and around the towers - they were energy carriers.
</p><br><p>When energy was floating in the air there would always be those willing to absorb it. However, even under the chains, not to mention the outer areas, the ice crystals were too few, their density not worth the Yellow Threat monster’s time and energy.
</p><br><p>However, near the towers, the situation was quite different.
</p><br><p>The density of the fog was sufficient for the creature inside to barely see what was one meter ahead, this had a positive effect on the density of the tiny crystals.
</p><br><p>Not all monsters were interested in this, many monsters that came from the waves had the flame attribute, they felt or knew that the energy of the fortress would give them strength, the sudden chill of the ice towers was a major problem for them as they were greatly weakened due to the changing effects.
</p><br><p>Thus, the flame monsters wanted to destroy the towers while the ice monsters defended them as it was advantageous for them. Just by being near the towers, they absorbed a dense stream of energy, the fog with crystals would appear while the stars on top of the towers were active.
</p><br><p>Sure, the fire monsters were much larger in number, but the area near the towers was the perfect arena for the ice monsters. They worked together as a team since they had a common goal, thanks to the fog they had disguise and their abilities were much more powerful.
</p><br><p>In fact, the Blind Sinner did something very simple - a trivial conflict of interest.
</p><br><p>Now the strongest monsters, the flame ones were weakened, some of the monsters no longer wanted to attack the fortress since they were defending the towers. As a result, only about half of the monsters retained their goal of attacking the fortress - the archers and Phantoms had to deal with that.
</p><br><br><p>The Blind Sinner took a step, turning into a shadow, disappearing from the top of the spire.
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, he showed up not far from the battlefield, watching over the wounded Katrin.</p>
