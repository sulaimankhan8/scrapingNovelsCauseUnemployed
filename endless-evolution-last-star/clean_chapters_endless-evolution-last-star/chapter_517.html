            <br><p>Following Franz, Adam and Silvana got out of the car. They were curious to know where they ended up, but they were even more eager to find out who the driver was.</p><br><p>The trip was long and they couldn't see who was in the driver's seat, so all this time it was a mystery to them.</p><br><p>"You..." Adam muttered looking at the girl standing next to Franz.</p><br><p>Franz glanced at Adam over his shoulder, as his eyes grew wider for a moment along with the resulting smile.</p><br><p>"Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet."</p><br><p>Franz uttered before stepping forward and pointing at the girl.</p><br><p>"This is Rosalind, let's just say she's my faithful assistant." Franz smirked.</p><br><p>Rosalind bowed low, keeping her palm pressed to her chest.</p><br><p>"Mr. Adam, Mrs. Silvana, it is a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you won't regret accepting our invitation."</p><br><p>"Yeah me either..." Adam said in a low voice, looking at her.</p><br><p>Rosalind had shoulder-length silver hair, a few locks tied back in an exquisite pattern, and her blue eyes were deep and clear as gems. She had glasses with round, thick lenses and steel, engraved frames.</p><br><p>Rosalind had no makeup or earrings like most women. She wore a strict gray butler's suit with large buttons, white gloves tight around her hands, and strict black boots.</p><br><p>Silvana swept her gaze over Rosalind a few times, a glint of admiration and a little envy in her eyes.</p><br><p>'Wow... She looks strict and formal at the same time, yet her outfit fits her perfectly and seems loose. It's an interesting choice...' Silvana pondered, biting her lip slightly. Discover stories with empire</p><br><p>Franz nodded, pleased with their reaction, and turned around, taking a few steps forward. Rosalind immediately followed him, keeping her arms folded behind her back, her posture straight and her chest slightly forward.</p><br><p>"Well, welcome to the Shadow Carnation. This is one of my favorite places." Franz spread his arms apart, presenting the view opened before them.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana turned to the side.</p><br><p>They saw a relatively small, two-story mansion with a dark tile roof and red brick walls, the top already covered with moss and vines.</p><br><p>The Shadow Carnation was on the far side of the eighth wing where the inhabitants of the First Ring could enjoy the clean, unspoiled nature and see a fair number of private homes, from small cottages to palaces.</p><br><p>Adam looked around, seeing only forests and fields. For a long way around them, there was nothing but this lonely mansion.</p><br><p>Silvana slowly turned her head, looking at Franz, who like a small child was waiting for praise.</p><br><p>"I thought we were going to the residence of the Balo Family, but it seems you had other plans." Silvana said quietly, she had realized that in the car when it took much longer than she expected to get there.</p><br><p>Franz shrugged with a faint smile.</p><br><p>"Come on, I think you've already figured out that my family doesn't know about this yet, however, they shouldn't care about my business. The Shadow Carnation belongs to me personally so no one will bother us here." Franz waved his hand before pulling out an iron key.</p><br><p>Adam nodded, following him.</p><br><p>Unlike most of the buildings in the First Ring, which were mostly skyscrapers and futuristic in appearance, the Shadow Carnation looked very old, almost abandoned, but that was just the style.</p><br><br><p>Franz paced the wooden bridge, approaching a massive dark wood door with a massive steel keyhole.</p><br><p>'I see... Not everyone wants to live on top of skyscrapers or in new houses full of technology, iron, and concrete.'</p><br><p>Adam pondered, gazing at the trimmed bushes around the mansion, a small circular pond lined with rocks in the distance, and fruit trees growing here and there.</p><br><p>Under the bridge ran a wide stream that, in a few years with a bit of help could grow into a river, but it was unlikely that the channels covered with old bricks would allow the water to erode the land.</p><br><p>"We don't have guests here for a long time, it's usually just me and Rosalind, so don't take offense if we can't give proper hospitality, but we'll try!" Franz laughed before swinging the key and deftly inserting it into the lock.</p><br><p>Despite its size and appearance suggestive of old age, the door opened without a sound or creak, smoothly revealing the passage to the inside.</p><br><p>Adam nodded, glancing at the door hinges, though he wasn't an architect or designer, he realized that they looked worn on purpose, though they were in perfect condition.</p><br><p>"Alright, while the old, vintage style is cool, it's stupid to give up the convenience of technology, isn't it?" Franz uttered, reaching his hand to the wall.</p><br><p>He pressed down on one specific spot, causing the slab to sink into the wall before returning to its original state.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>With a series of thuds, the built-in lamps in the ceiling turned on, with a nice slightly diffused light like sunlight.</p><br><br><p>Recently he was looking at the prices of houses in the Second Ring, so he realized that houses in the First Ring should cost a lot more, but...</p><br><p>'I doubt an ordinary house in the eighth wing can compare to this. This mansion takes up a lot of space, which is very valuable in the small First Ring, moreover, this house looks old, but it has all the necessary amenities and technology. Fuck... how much money do the high nobles have?'</p><br><p>It wasn't that Adam was chasing money, he was quite content with what he had, but the difference between some people and others was frightening.</p><br><p>Silvana was as impressed as Adam, but tried not to show it, keeping her expression calm.</p><br><br><p>Franz walked forward to the wide stone table, sitting down on one of the two red leather couches.</p><br><p>He gestured to the opposite couch. Adam and Silvana glanced over and sat down.</p><br><p>Rosalind stood behind Franz, still holding her hands behind her back.</p><br><p>"I don't even know where to start... Oh, right." Franz smirked, "Adam, I think this will be useful for you. What do you know about the Eight Blades?"</p>
