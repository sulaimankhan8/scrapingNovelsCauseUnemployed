            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1257: Ash for the forest</strong></p><br><p>Adam quickly adapted to different situations. Perhaps adaptation was the only thing in which humans surpassed monsters, and the more experience and dangerous battles a person had behind them, the faster it happened.</p><br><p>A few clashes were enough for Adam to understand what his threads were capable of now. Basically, everything was limited by his abilities, the length of the threads, and his imagination.</p><br><p>Sure, control was also an important component, but at the K4 Level, he had control incomparable to the K1 or K2 Levels.</p><br><p>Moreover, when he had to create something really complex, like the thread grid for defense, Lone Blaze could help him finish the last touch.</p><br><p>The Red Bloom realized too late that Adam was not an ordinary Phantom, that he was one of those who could defeat her.</p><br><p>If the First Star paid attention to a Phantom, it meant that he was a real threat.</p><br><p>The Red Bloom was smart, but just as arrogant. However, she valued her life above all else and knew that no matter how hard she tried, she was not the strongest.</p><br><p>‘Fuck… Maybe this time I won’t win…’ The Red Bloom clenched her fists tightly as she watched Adam move towards her.</p><br><p>With each leap, an energy burst appeared behind him as he moved through the air.</p><br><p>‘In that case, I’ll have to run. Alright, I can do this.’</p><br><p>Strangely enough, all of the Red Bloom’s arrogance evaporated in an instant.</p><br><p>She accepted that her victory was unlikely, that she would not be able to absorb the energy from the dark forest and complete her evolution. Still, survival was more important—there was no doubt about that.</p><br><p>If the Red Bloom had not been able to make such decisions when necessary, she would not have lived to see this moment.</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, she crossed her arms at her chest as several petals grew beside her, ready to envelop her inside the bud.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened, realizing he didn’t have time to attack her.</p><br><p>‘Shit! Does she really want to leave?!’</p><br><p>The Red Bloom raised her head, looking at Adam with a sly smile.</p><br><p>“See you later, young Phantom. Next time… the energy of the First Star slumbering inside you will become mi…!”</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, a dark palm emerged from her chest, piercing her heart on the way.</p><br><p>A stream of blood gushed from the Red Bloom’s mouth.</p><br><p>A ghastly grimace mixed with pain covered her face, her veins bulging as she slowly turned to meet Garrah’s dark, amber eyes.</p><br><p>He had no mercy for the invaders of his land.</p><br><p>“You… I knew you were trash… You didn’t even dare to fight me face to face!”</p><br><p>Despite the Red Bloom’s words, her panic was evident. As a last resort, her energy chaotically summoned dozens of roots and flowers from the ground, ultimately forcing Garrah to retreat.</p><br><p>Adam was unable to complete his attack, as he did not expect Garrah’s next move in their battle to be so precise and deadly.</p><br><br><p>Dark clots of blood splattered on the ground as Red Bloom retreated to the side. In this state, escape was impossible. Without a heart, she would be dead in a minute; only her level of strength and sturdy body allowed her to remain alive.</p><br><p>Well, her origin also played a big role in this, as her body was not entirely made of flesh and bones.</p><br><p>When her vision became blurred, she reached out her hand, looking at the fighting monsters and the bloom soldiers.</p><br><p>“Alright, it’s time for you to be useful…” Her hoarse voice rang out as her fingers tensed.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a hundred crystals from each of the bloom soldiers exploded, returning energy to the Red Bloom.</p><br><p>Adam stood next to Garrah, watching as red streams swirled around the Red Bloom to fill the hole in her chest eventually. Roots intertwined with each other, connecting her flesh and blood as a tiny crystal appeared where her heart had once been.</p><br><p>Unlike the Regenerative Monster, the Red Bloom could not grow herself a new heart, but like a plant, as long as she was alive and had resources and time, she could survive even such a seemingly fatal wound.</p><br><br><br><p>The Red Bloom breathed heavily, horrified as she realized she was surrounded. The monsters no longer had any enemies, so hundreds of them turned their evil gaze solely on her.</p><br><p>Even the Dark Blobs and Thorn Hunters rose to show they were ready to take part in the final battle.</p><br><p>No one was in a hurry to move, despite their desire to attack the Red Bloom and tear her to pieces, they understood that only two of them had the right to make the decision.</p><br><p>“Adam.” Garrah’s serious voice rang out. “Do you mind if I do it?”</p><br><p>Without further ado, Adam took a step back.</p><br><p>It wasn’t his tragedy from the beginning; he was only a temporary participant.</p><br><br><p>Garrah’s heavy footsteps were the only sound in the forest for a while. He didn’t look anywhere except at the Red Bloom. Her eyes trembled as she tried to figure out how to get out of this situation.</p><br><p>“Wait… Garrah, you’re the head of the forest, aren’t you?!” the Red Bloom asked with a nervous smile.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Garrah nodded slightly.</p><br><p>“I never call myself that, but I must admit that others would agree with you on that. However, even if I am the head of the forest, do you really think I would spare someone like you?”</p><br><p>The Red Bloom’s eyes flashed.</p><br><p>“Yes! You saw what I’m capable of! You all saw it! I can be useful to you! I won’t consume energy from your forest, but bring it from another place so that your territory can develop, and you can all become stronger!”</p><br><p>A hint of doubt was reflected in some of the monsters. They understood that the Red Bloom was capable of this.</p><br><p>“I see…” Garrah nodded slightly. “Given your abilities, it is within your power.”</p><br><p>The Red Bloom smiled broadly.</p><br><p>“Then let’s work together! We can start…”</p><br><p>His low voice interrupted her.</p><br><p>“There is one thing…”</p><br><p>Garrah stepped forward.</p><br><p>“You can actually be useful to this forest. Right now.”</p><br><br><p>His hand touched her chest as green flames engulfed her, without pity in Garrah’s gaze.</p><br><p>“You will become ashes for our land.”</p>
