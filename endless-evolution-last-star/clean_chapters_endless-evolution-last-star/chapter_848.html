            <br><p>Andreas's words took Adam and Silvana by surprise. They didn't expect anyone to be waiting for them at the entrance, especially since they'd come from the side of the technical room and not the main hall.</p><br><p>Without a shred of embarrassment, Adam swung his arm.</p><br><p>"Looks like Nefis or Douglas informed about us, doesn't it? However... I don't think that was necessary."</p><br><p>In response, Andreas smiled weakly, causing his neat wrinkles to show. After all, he was not young, not for a long time now.</p><br><p>"No matter who reported you, you are already here. You've only recently become a K3-Phantom, so the entire northern part of the Twilight Palace is at your complete disposal."</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam had no trouble understanding the meaning behind Andreas's words.</p><br><p>He raised an eyebrow, fleeting surprise visible in his eyes:</p><br><p>"Hmm? Does that mean everything is free?"</p><br><p>As soon as his words were uttered Silvana's eyes went wide. She rushed to correct Adam, for that was brazen, but... Andreas stopped her with a gesture.</p><br><p>"There is no need to rush Ms. Silvana, for Mr. Adam is right. For K3-Phantoms the Twilight Palace provides its services for free. Well, for those who only summoned the Crystal Gates and were at Heaven Island."</p><br><p>Shock covered Silvana's face, though Adam was not startled. For some reason, he was sure that Andreas knew more than the average person should.</p><br><p>A slight tension hung for a moment. Adam turned around, stepped forward as his eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>"But... It can't be that simple, right?"</p><br><p>"Hehehe... Mr. Adam, I would not deceive you. After all, you are a well-known talent. I can see that now too."</p><br><p>Andreas's sly, wisdom-filled eyes ran over Adam's dry body, paying attention to his long hair.</p><br><p>"You've spent more time under the queen's influence than expected. I'm afraid you don't realize that this isn't exactly a normal situation. It seems that even in the depths of darkness you had unfinished business."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam's aura lashed out, eager to see how Andreas would react to this.</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, watching the white streams rushing from Adam, calm and dense, but ready to unleash their full force upon Adam's will.</p><br><p>However, Andreas didn't even flinch, at the same time he didn't even begin to release his aura in response. It seemed strange to Adam, but familiar to Silvana.</p><br><p>'Wait...' she muttered in disbelief, 'So Andreas is the same as Douglas? Once again, I'm sure he's not a Phantom, then... what is he...? No, what are they?'</p><br><p>Adam didn't have the same feeling as Silvana, yet also realized that Andreas was not the Phantom.</p><br><p>'Hmm...' Adam mused, 'He doesn't block my aura, he just effortlessly withstands pressure like a rock. It's almost as if his body itself is strong enough to do so. It's weird...'</p><br><p>A lone shiver went through Adam's body as his frame blurred.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam lunged towards Andreas in the deadly shadow, his palm like a blade ended up at the man's neck who hadn't even flinched.</p><br><br><p>Adam's hoarse voice boomed out, his blue eyes meeting Andreas's with a sly gaze.</p><br><br><p>Anger, anger, indignation and many other emotions were expected by Silvana, yet followed by something unexpected:</p><br><p>"Hahahahahahahahah!"</p><br><p>Andreas's laughter thundered through the room, bouncing off the walls and making the wooden beams shake.</p><br><p>"Old man Douglas was right about you. This is our first meeting and you decided to attack me just like that?"</p><br><p>However, Adam didn't rush to remove his hand from Andreas's neck, only a sharp glint passed across his eyes.</p><br><p>After that, Andreas shook his head.</p><br><p>"No, I'm not a monster. I'm a human."</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Adam grunted, "Somehow I believe you, even though you and Douglas... You're both pretty damn weird for humans."</p><br><p>Andreas shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Well, I'm afraid you both don't need to think about that, as you have more important tasks to accomplish."</p><br><p>Then, Andreas took a step to the side and, with a wave of his hand, pointed toward the exit:</p><br><p>"For example, to regain your strength and rest at the special hotel of the First Wing. A place luxurious and magnificent even for the First Wing. But... I have something to inform you."</p><br><p>"Oh... No wonder there's some sort of trick. That explains why everything will be free for me."</p><br><p>Andreas smiled slyly as his hand disappeared under his jacket, appearing back in a flash.</p><br><p>Between his fingers were clutched three gold coins. In the center of each coin was a dark crystal absorbing all light.</p><br><p>"Mr. Adam, these are the Twilight Coins."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Coins? Didn't you say that at Twilight Palace everything is free for me as a K3-Phantom?"</p><br><p>Without delay, Andreas nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Sure, my words are pure truth, you can rest assured of that. The Twilight Coins are not needed to pay for services or food, they have a different purpose."</p><br><p>Andreas slowly lifted his chin, his eyes narrowed like an old snake.</p><br><p>"Five twilight coins - that's the price to leave the Twilight Palace. Unfortunately, there is no other way for you to escape this place."</p><br><br><p>Andreas barely had time to finish his sentence before Adam smoothly stepped backwards, the energy naturally covered his legs, making him as fast as a ghost.</p><br><p>His figure swept by Silvana's side, taking her hand firmly and heading straight for the exit - he was going to return to the maintenance room and walk straight to Nefis.</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, the door closed abruptly, the rumble spreading through the room.</p><br><p>However... could a simple door have stopped a K3-Phantom?</p><br><p>Without a doubt in his gaze, Adam tore forward, leaving a dark trail on the ground. His knee appeared to be slightly raised, about to rip the door open in a powerful momentum.</p><br><p>Suddenly, a pale blue flash fell across his face as a dense barrier covered the entire room in a split second.</p><br><p>Electric shocks rippled apart as Adam's knee and the barrier made contact. Not three seconds later, the impact forced Adam to step back, shredding the right side of his pants to pieces.</p><br><p>Without saying a word, Adam turned around, over his shoulder, directing his serene gaze at Andreas.</p><br><p>"Mr. Andreas... With all due respect, but... I want to kill you."</p>
