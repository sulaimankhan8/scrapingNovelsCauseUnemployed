            <br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Tremble was not a rare occurrence in the Dead Lands, especially in the Wild Land, most often caused by either energy or some kind of battle between powerful beings passing nearby.</p><br><p>However, it was almost always a quick, short shake more like a shockwave than an actual earthquake, but this was clearly not the case.</p><br><p>A wild, active shudder ran through the entire fortress and hundreds of meters beyond, the muddy water in the ring shook, the small stones on the bridge rolled over and the black sand crashed into each other in chaotic waves.</p><br><p>Trying to regain her balance, Katrin shifted her weight from one foot to the other with a confused expression.</p><br><p>"Alan! What the hell is going on here?! It's coming from deep within the fortress!"</p><br><p>Explore stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Alan replied quickly, but he didn't have anything to say:</p><br><p>'I don't know... I don't have any information about it and it's not like a battle between monsters. The three strongest monsters of the fortress were defeated by this Unknown Phantom...'</p><br><p>Then, Katrin's eyes narrowed as she tightly clenched her fists with anger.</p><br><p>"Fuck it! I'm sure it has something to do with this Phantom! So he's here, and he's doing something underneath but he's not going to help us? I swear when I see him I'll beat him half to death!"</p><br><p>Understanding her anger was more than possible. The strong Phantom was ignoring them and causing them more problems, at least the ground trembling so violently couldn't be a good sign.</p><br><br><p>Viron stepped back before quickly running towards the bridge quickly catching up with Gnash who was already at the gate, she was standing leaning against the wall next to the stumped Dark Watchers.</p><br><p>"Hmm, it's not like you're afraid of monsters."</p><br><p>Viron stopped abruptly, completely ignoring the Dark Watchers as well as her.</p><br><p>In response, Gnash smirked insidiously.</p><br><p>"Hah, boy, you think this is the first Stronghold I've ever been in? I know perfectly well how things work around here."</p><br><p>Then, she walked over to one of the guards and drummed her fingers on his broad back protected in cold armor.</p><br><p>The Dark Watcher shuddered but didn't react.</p><br><p>"Until we attack them, or unless there is a good reason, they won't fight us. Well, at least these two."</p><br><p>With a nonchalant look, Gnash turned around looking inside the fortress. The first Phantoms inside were already fighting against the Shadow Walkers trying to take as many runes as they could, though they appeared very rarely, far less often than when Adam was here.</p><br><p>Yet, now both Phantoms and monsters had to deal with the effects of the earthquake by actively balancing, unlike Viron and Gnash who had no trouble staying in place.</p><br><br><p>With a predatory look, Gnash found herself behind Viron, running her palm along his spine.</p><br><p>"Oh, what strong muscles. You can't achieve something like that just because you're a Phantom. Looks like someone has enough discipline to keep practicing even with energy, right?"</p><br><p>In response, Viron only spoke briefly:</p><br><br><p>Gnash licked her lip.</p><br><p>"Hmph, what are you talking about? Are you so embarrassed that that's all you could say?"</p><br><p>Slowly, Viron turned around looking at her over his shoulder, his expression devoid of emotion.</p><br><p>"Does it look like I'm embarrassed?"</p><br><p>It was a rhetorical question and Gnash realized it, for a few seconds it put her in a daze.</p><br><p>"It only took me a few seconds to realize that you are in awe of Adam Vinter. In that case, why are you teasing me? Why are you touching another man?"</p><br><br><p>Gnash abruptly stepped aside as she irritably crossed her arms over her chest.</p><br><p>"How perceptive you are turning out to be! Even if you're right, so what? What am I supposed to do?"</p><br><p>Viron shrugged nonchalantly, it was obvious to him.</p><br><p>"For example, you could write to him or his Operator, meet and like a grown woman say everything directly."</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Gnash's face flushed at the thought of it, her cheeks puffed up and her gaze directed downward.</p><br><p>"I don't know what you think of me, but I'm not going to pounce on anyone I find sympathetic..."</p><br><p>Viron's eyebrow twitched, he couldn't believe what he was hearing.</p><br><p>'Damn... Out of the two times we've talked, you've complimented me twice, even though we've only just met. You're not the type to wait and prepare yourself for the big moment.'</p><br><p>"Anyway, it's not important right now and I'll deal with my personal life on my own!"</p><br><p>Gnash headed onward, going to help her mates. In her wake, she heard Viron's calm words.</p><br><p>"I can't claim to be right, but... It's always better to try than not, at least if you risk nothing."</p><br><p>She didn't answer anything, just muttered to herself, it was too quiet for anyone to hear:</p><br><p>"Yeah... You're definitely right, but for me, there are risks, very, very big ones..."</p><br><br><p>Gnash stepped outside the gate, about to join the battle when her eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, a dense crimson energy emerged from beneath the fortress, surging upward, reaching the tops of the towers.</p><br><p>The energy was like a flame screaming in violent agony, constantly changing its magnitude, inflicting terror on every living being. Its edges actively shook like wild blades, like the scream of an ancient creature so complex that mere souls could not even discern its voice.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a dense energy from the External Artifact traveled through the entire fortress, provoking a large number of purple flows and runes, as if trying to prepare for the worst.</p><br><p>Viron was the first to realize the consequences for them.</p><br><p>He waved his hand, feeling how dense the energy became, building up with the power of the crimson flame.</p><br><p>"Things just got ten times worse..."</p><br><br><p>Among the bright crystals, Dorman Lord sat trying to decide if it was worth it to fall back into sleep.</p><br><p>The black disk covering the moon made it hard for him to make up his mind, slumber and the possibility of a great battle were equally appealing.</p><br><p>However, when he saw the crimson flame in the distance, he made his decision.</p>
