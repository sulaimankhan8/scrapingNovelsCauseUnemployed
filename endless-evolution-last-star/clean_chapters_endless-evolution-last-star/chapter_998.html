            <br><p>The events on the first floor were approaching the middle, the darkest and bloodiest part, because Kreyna's patience was not infinite. On the contrary, she was a very impatient person.</p><br><p>If she had known what Vorx was capable of and that some weak Phantom with three lesser gates could hurt her, she would have taken their battle much more seriously from the beginning.</p><br><p>Vorx took his human form as he, along with Rish, retreated back, not wanting to approach Kreyna.</p><br><p>The darkness surrounded them, creating a circle from which they could not escape.</p><br><p>Kreyna was in no hurry to attack, she had to finish creating the circle. Unfortunately for Risha and Vorx, she had enough energy to consume everything with her darkness.</p><br><p>This was only the beginning.</p><br><p>"What are we going to do?" Risha gripped her axe tightly, her wound no longer bleeding. She had used the energy properly, strengthening her shoulder considerably for a short period.</p><br><p>Vorx smiled bitterly. "Well... Do we have any other choice but to keep fighting?"</p><br><p>With a deep nod, Risha agreed, yet worry was visible in her eyes. She realized that she had less time with each passing second.</p><br><p>'I have to open the fourth lesser gates, or... she'll kill us. She and Vorx are the same kind, but hell...'</p><br><p>Risha stared at Kreyna, who had already stopped breathing heavily. Despite Vorx's successful string of attacks, she didn't have as much damage on her as Risha would have liked.</p><br><p>A few scratches and a barely visible bruise on her stomach were Kreyna's main wounds, not considering her back covered in red streaks.</p><br><p>'Anyway. We can wound her and break her armor. That's enough to win - the key is to hit her more often than she hits us!'</p><br><p>At the same moment, Kreyna's scowling expression replaced her usual sly grin.</p><br><p>The dark circle was complete, and her blades flashed brightly in a purple flash.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Adam and Heret moved towards their target. They could feel the energy fluctuations coming from the first floor of the castle. This gave them a rough idea of what was happening there and who was winning the most important battle.</p><br><p>Silvana kept Adam informed of the events. She could see some fragments through Risha's NEP. Either way, even with shared sight and shared voice, cameras were a great option for getting information and following the battle.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Heret simultaneously jumped away from the building, approaching the middle of the fallen ring.</p><br><p>Here, they had the opportunity to begin their ascent to the top.</p><br><p>On one side of the castle, the ring was still hovering above the ground, and on the other, it had been destroyed by crashing into the surface. It was one structure, so at the break point, part of the ring was heading upward, connecting to a bridge in the distance.</p><br><p>"So, this bridge used to make direct contact with the king?" Adam asked, quickly climbing up the tilted ring.</p><br><p>Heret nodded deeply. "Yes, the first floor has access to the top as well, but the castle was built so that guests and important persons could meet the king by going over the bridge."</p><br><p>"But... What about the ring? Isn't it a problem how huge it is and that it hovers so high above the ground?"</p><br><p>"No, there used to be many small bridges leading to the ring, now they're all destroyed. Furthermore, don't forget that I'm a monster, a serpent, not a human. We can all turn into massive creatures."</p><br><p>"I see. Arnoth doesn't like to take audiences, right?"</p><br><p>Heret sighed heavily. He hated to realize that on the throne where the king should have sat was now Arnoth, their invader. But, it was their job to end the oppression.</p><br><p>"Yes, I think you've already figured out that despite what he's done and his power, he's a rather quiet, I'd even say passive monster. In the months they've been here, I've only seen him a few times, and he hardly does anything."</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>"In any other situation, that would be considered an advantage. But it makes him a dangerous foe. We don't know much about his abilities, right?"</p><br><p>Heret stated ahead, gradually they approached the top of the ring.</p><br><p>"Well, I was in the battle when the black flash appeared. I saw Arnoth and Kreyna kill the king and queen, so I have some information. But I'm afraid I don't know his weak spots. We'll have to find out during the battle."</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam was not disappointed with the answer.</p><br><p>"Good, he doesn't know anything about me. He may have information about you, but I'll be something of a surprise to him!"</p><br><p>Heret answered nothing, he just smiled weakly.</p><br><p>With the next leap, they found themselves on a hovering ring stepping over the border.</p><br><p>In the distance, the tall peaks of the castle could be seen, as well as the countless carved columns of the throne room. Somewhere deep, behind them hid the throne and Arnoth's silhouette.</p><br><p>Arnoth could probably attack them directly from this distance if he wanted to. Unlike Adam and Heret, who did not hold back their auras, Arnoth remained calm. Adam knew that Arnoth was far ahead, but could not feel his aura, his presence.</p><br><p>Arnoth's inaction had another reason - he was not the last obstacle before the throne room.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Heret stopped abruptly, staring at two golden columns a hundred meters ahead.</p><br><p>This was the beginning of the bridge and the end of the ring, the boundary between the two great structures.</p><br><p>And, it was one of the most guarded places.</p><br><p>"Hey... Heret..." Adam's voice shook looking at the three huge silhouettes ahead. "You didn't tell me Arnoth had personal guards."</p><br><p>Heret's expression was no less surprised than Adam's.</p><br><p>Three massive creatures, three of the Light Goliaths, stood behind the golden pillars. Compared to them, the Light Guardians were small knights.</p><br><p>Even if Heret transformed into his monster form, he would be no bigger than a Light Goliath.</p><br><p>They were over ten meters tall, houses could fit on their shoulders, and their hands could grip the golden columns and break free from the great bridge with their sheer physical strength.</p><br><br><br><p>"I swear I would tell you about this if I knew."</p>
