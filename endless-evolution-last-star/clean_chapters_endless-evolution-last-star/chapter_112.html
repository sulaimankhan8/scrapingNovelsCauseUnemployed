            <br><p>Less than a minute ago, hundreds of monsters were running straight at Adam - at their prey that surely could not escape their powerful jaws and sharp claws.</p><br><p>However... in just a few seconds, the monsters were already escaping Adam, not as a predator but as a natural disaster, devastating and all-consuming in its unmitigated violence.</p><br><br><p>The first silver threads, passed through the Azure Wolves, cutting them to pieces, rapidly unwinding and increasing its kill zone like a flywheel of death.</p><br><p>"What the fuck..." Ester muttered in disbelief.</p><br><p>Soon, the last, longest threads reached the monsters, not letting go of any wolves. The threads cut through their tails passed through their throats, and diagonally - perfectly straight, slicing through their heads along with their brains and eyes filled with primal fear.</p><br><p>The ground also could not escape the silver threads. They left hundreds of random cuts on the ice, gradually turning into bizarre patterns where thick dark blood flowed, soon tending to merge into a single river.</p><br><br><p>Adam descended to the ground as Silver Swirl vanished, standing among hundreds of corpses whose only cause - was him.</p><br><p>His fingertips trembled, and drops of blood dripped from the tips of his gloves, showing the price he had paid for this attack. Numerous wounds covered his hands like hundreds of cuts.</p><br><p>"Well, well... I don't think I'm supposed to feel this..." Adam muttered, looking at the torn-apart monsters. His voice was calm, even quiet and peaceful, but there was a slight smile on his face - from accomplished work.</p><br><p>Owen took a deep breath.</p><br><p>"Fuck... So that's what his Nexus can do, that's impressive. Seems like defending against his threads would be difficult even for me."</p><br><br><p>"It's actually insane... Unlike me, Adam's battlefield is melee combat, yet he has such a destructive ability. His Initial Gene is something extraordinary for sure."</p><br><p>Fred rose from the ground, shook off the dust with a calm look, and cast a disdainful glance at Ester.</p><br><p>"You're lucky his Nexus proved so useful. Otherwise, his death would have been entirely your fault, and don't you dare interrupt me again!"</p><br><p>Ester smirked. It seemed that Fred's words didn't hurt her at all.</p><br><p>"Hah, my intuition didn't fail me. Perhaps I sensed from the beginning that he would do well. How would you know otherwise?"</p><br><p>Fred raised an eyebrow, looking at her with a strange face, as if to say - 'Are you serious?'</p><br><p>Ester wanted to say something, but soon, her eyes went wide, and a slight shiver ran through her body.</p><br><br><p>The two Prime Azure Wolves, rushed straight towards Adam, realizing that he was now the main threat to all the monsters. They had to kill him, or else more monsters would die from his silver threads. Prime Azure Wolves acted on instinct, eager to get rid of the threat.</p><br><p>They only needed a few seconds to reach Adam and attack him, stepping their massive paws over the torn bodies of their fellows.</p><br><p>"Shit!" Ester sprinted forward as the Prime Azure Wolves had already reached Adam, bringing their paws down on him.</p><br><p>Adam's Silver Swirl was enough to kill the Prime Azure Wolf he was fighting, another one before that was killed by Ester and Fred, so these two Prime Azure Wolves were the only ones left.</p><br><p>Fred, Bryda, and Owen were alert, going to help Adam in any way they could. They had to get the attention of the Prime Azure Wolves, or Adam would be in serious trouble.</p><br><p>They hadn't expected this, so they should have hurried since the Prime Azure Wolves were already attacking.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana's voice spread into their earbuds, she, as well as the other Operators, had access to all channels, for an emergency like this.</p><br><p>'Stay back!' Silvana said quickly, in a worried voice.</p><br><p>However, she seemed to be worried not for Adam, but for them, which was very strange for everyone, since it was Adam who was in danger. </p><br><p>Well, soon, Owen and each of them realized the reason for Silvana's strange behavior.</p><br><br><p>A silver flash rippled through the ice crystals and the cloud of cold vapor that rose from the attacks of the Prime Azure Wolves, revealing Adam thrusting his needle straight for the monster's throat.</p><br><p>He was facing two powerful foes at once, but Adam was not afraid, for he was in a special condition at the time. His veins were swollen, and his eyes were bloodshot, concentrating on one thing only: the fight.</p><br><p>Before the deadly threat, Adam entered Resonance, becoming dangerous not only to every monster in his sight but also to his allies.</p><br><p>The main goal of the Phantom, or any hunter, is to kill its victim or monster. During Resonance, this goal reaches an absolute peak where nothing else matters and is collateral damage.</p><br><p>"Oh, it looks like we don't have to worry about him. The fact that he was in a dangerous situation played to his advantage." Ester muttered with a slightly surprised look, watching Adam's battle.</p><br><p>He dodged the Prime Azure Wolves' attacks in time, slashing their skins with his needle in return, leaving more and more small wounds on their bodies.</p><br><br><p>Several white arrows flew over Ester's shoulders, stabbing into the back legs of the Prime Azure Wolves.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Ester turned around, puzzled.</p><br><br><p>"Chances are if I get too close to him, I'll get punched in the face too, but... he could use some help from afar. You should go handle the other monsters, or do you want to keep being as useless as you are?"</p><br><p>Ester's eye began to twitch as an innocent but threatening smile appeared on her face with narrowed eyes.</p><br><p>"I swear. If I could, I'd chop you up with my axe, accidentally..." Ester said with a trembling voice.</p><br><br><p>In response, Fred fired a few more shots, completely ignoring Ester as if she wasn't there.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, those two could make a great couple, what do you think?" Owen smirked, rubbing his chin.</p><br><p>"Watch out!" Someone exclaimed, turning to Owen.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a massive Fury Snow Imot appeared behind Owen, pointing its paws towards his head.</p><br><br><p>Without turning around, Owen swung his massive shield, throwing the monster aside with such force that Fury Snow Imot, wouldn't be able to recover for a while yet.</p><br><p>"Hmm... So far, so good. The fact that Adam has entered Resonance makes things a lot easier. However, there's only one problem left." Bryda muttered, shifting her gaze from Adam to Alexia.</p><br><br><p>Alexia stepped forward confidently, stepping into the arena - an empty area freed by the monsters, especially for her and Frost Beast.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With each step of the Frost Beast, a shiver spread across the ground, growing stronger and stronger as it approached Alexia.</p><br><p>"Alexia... She's strong as hell, but... Frost Beast is an unfortunate opponent for her." Owen said, looking at Alexia whose eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>She slammed her fists into each other, causing a cascade of sparks.</p><br><p>At the same moment, her arms and legs were covered in a dense layer of ice, with sharp crystals pointing in one direction, creating a flow effect.</p><br><p>"Using ice to defeat the Frost Beast... 6th Rank. It might not be easy at all."</p>
