            <br><p>The Twilight Palace was considered a hotel, but at its core, it was a mini-city with battlegrounds.</p><br><p>For that reason, there were more than just restaurants and rooms with soft beds. A salon with top specialists was no surprise.</p><br><p>That was the place Adam went to first of all.</p><br><p>It was empty inside, the northern part of the Twilight Palace wasn't so crowded that the salon was full of people.</p><br><p>Still, there was always at least one person here ready to do the job.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Silvana walked towards the salon following the map, without it, one could easily get lost here.</p><br><p>Silvana looked around. Everything seemed like the best salons she never had enough money for as an Operator.</p><br><p>Tables with massive mirrors, comfortable chairs with full mobility, and all sorts of scissors, combs, and hair-styling products fill the shelves.</p><br><p>On an empty visitor's couch, not far from the entrance, sat the only employee ready to receive visitors.</p><br><p>A middle-aged man in a stylish gray shirt and tight black pants with a carefree view drank coffee, on a small round table were sweets and cookies. Usually, this was used by visitors, but there were none now.</p><br><p>Hearing the door open the man turned around, greeting Adam and Silvana with his gorgeous smile. His green eyes were almost closed, only a slit remained, his light, thick hair was lush and seemed to shine like gold wanting to show off its richness.</p><br><p>It was obvious that the man took care of himself, whether it was his fashion, his hairstyle, or his soft skin without a single blemish, allowing him to look much younger than he actually was.</p><br><p>Not wanting to appear rude, the man returned the half-full cup to the saucer and rose elegantly.</p><br><p>In a wide, confident gait, he appeared before Adam and Silvana before bowing low, touching his shoulder.</p><br><p>"Mr. Adam and Ms. Silvana I presume?"</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana looked over at each other. For a while they heard the exact same greeting but from Andreas.</p><br><p>Noticing their confusion, the man smiled warmly.</p><br><p>"Oh, I didn't mean to embarrass you. It's a standard greeting in this place, but we don't have to interact formally."</p><br><p>Then, with complete freedom as if they were old friends, the man extended his hand as a sign of introduction:</p><br><p>"My name is Goran, and I keep an eye on this place." Goran glanced around the parlor, then turned his gaze to Adam, "As well as making sure that all visitors to the northern part of the Twilight Palace remain handsome."</p><br><p>For a moment, his eyes flickered to Silvana.</p><br><p>"I can help the ladies too, of course, but I think Adam will be first, right?"</p><br><p>Shaking Goran's hand with a firm grip, Adam nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Sure, my hair isn't the only problem, but it's worth dealing with first."</p><br><p>With a sweet smile, Goran confirmed.</p><br><p>"Whatever you say, after all as long as you are a guest of the Twilight Palace, all services are free."</p><br><br><p>Not five minutes later Adam was in the chair in front of the mirror, Silvana with a freshly made cup of strong coffee and Goran towering behind Adam, his hands ready to lunge for the scissors at any moment.</p><br><p>"So, Adam, I've heard about your successes. You've been through a lot and after important events you always want a change of style, don't you?"</p><br><p>Without waiting for an answer Goran dipped his fingers into Adam's hair, gently lifting it up, the length and density were enough for a braid.</p><br><p>"I won't hide I knew of your arrival and guessed you'd decide to stop by my place, my salon. I know your stern, a little brutal, a slightly lonely style."</p><br><p>Goran let go of Adam's hair, heading for his bangs.</p><br><p>"What about choosing something loose, and strong, because what could be more important than freedom?"</p><br><p>However, Adam wasn't ready to analyze so deeply for the sake of a simple haircut. He had requests, and he just wanted them fulfilled.</p><br><p>"Just spare me my waist-length hair, it shouldn't be too short but not too long either. Other than that, I'll trust you."</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Goran shrugged.</p><br><p>"You can rest assured - I'll make sure you're thrilled."</p><br><p>Then, a slight smile formed on his face as his hands turned into flashes. Two pairs of scissors appeared open, ready to give Adam a fresh cut.</p><br><p>After all, given Queen Elisa's space, Adam had been in this state for several years.</p><br><p>Adam placed his hands on the arms of the chair, staring intently at his reflection.</p><br><br><br><p>Silvana wasn't a hairdresser or stylist, but like any girl, she was better at it than the guys.</p><br><p>For her, Goran's moves were a show filled with grace and pure skill passed through experience.</p><br><p>She was willing to pay for the spectacle alone, enjoying the combination of bitter coffee and sweets, completely oblivious to the fact that Adam was sitting in the chair.</p><br><p>Only an hour later, Goran finished the job. He used not only scissors but various tools that went into action as well as hair styling products - a final touch.</p><br><p>Then, Goran stepped aside and exclaimed:</p><br><br><p>The job was complete, so it was time for Adam to show off. Silvana concentrated not wanting to miss a moment.</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam rose, turning to Silvana, allowing her to examine him and his reflection in the mirror.</p><br><p>Silvana gasped as her eyes went wide.</p><br><p>Previously, before the events at Heaven Island, Adam had short black hair, the ends falling precariously over his forehead, but now the length had changed.</p><br><p>The previously short bangs were now two strands falling over Adam's face, covering his left and right side like curtains, the tips were only just below his obvious cheekbones due to his exhaustion, falling into the dimples on his cheeks. The hair in this part was loose and wide, but the situation changed drastically as he moved to the base part.</p><br><p>His hair was cut short here, cut in such a way that a cascade of dark spikes flowed down to his neck, gradually getting shorter until it disappeared completely into a smooth line.</p><br><p>Adam ran his hand over the back of his head, feeling the thin layer transition into a thicker one at the top - the pleasant freshness after any good haircut came over him.</p><br><p>Then, his gaze traveled lower, looking at his lean body and clothes. Sure, he wasn't wearing his torn clothes like he had after returning from the Dead Lands, but the barrier damaged his pants, and it wasn't exactly what he wanted in his new style.</p><br><p>As if realizing everything from the look in his eyes, Goran touched his shoulder.</p><br><p>Their gazes met as Goran pointed to a store in the distance, the stylish frame was the entrance to one of the clothing stores, there were several on the grounds of Twilight Palace.</p><br><p>"A good friend of mine works there. She's one of those whose taste I trust so I'm sure she can find you a new outfit."</p><br><p>Adam nodded weakly before looking at Silvana. He couldn't help but notice that her eyes shone like bright stars.</p><br><p>"I see you're thrilled with Goran's work. Well, it's your turn."</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Silvana was confused.</p><br><p>Adam headed for the exit, he turned around, glancing at Silvana over his shoulder.</p><br><p>"While Goran works his magic on you, I'll go and buy some stuff. Although... can you buy something if it's free?"</p><br><p>With a deep look, Adam thoughtfully rubbed his chin.</p><br><p>"Hmm... That's a good question."</p><br><p>Then, Adam walked out of Goran's parlor, leaving Silvana alone.</p><br><p>Before she could do anything, Goran was beside her and gently took her by the shoulders forcing her to take a few steps forward until they stopped in front of the mirror.</p><br><p>Goran touched her loose strands neatly hiding her face.</p><br><p>"For Adam, we chose the loose option." Goran's words rang out wanting to get Silvana's attention, "But, it won't work so well with you. You're an Operator, you're a serious person, and your sharp facial features are begging for something tough."</p><br><p>"But..." Silvana's voice shook, "Adam wanted me to keep my hair messy. He said I look cute like this..."</p><br><p>Goran leaned over, looking at Silvana from different angles.</p><br><p>"Well, I can't say he's wrong, but it would be back to the beginning for you."</p><br><p>"Hmm? What are you talking about?" Silvana turned around, confusion reflected in her eyes.</p><br><p>Goran smiled weakly.</p><br><p>"I realized you were, coming so I looked at your photos, you're an Operator so finding your profile picture isn't hard at all. You've changed in your time with Adam, that's not bad and not good, it's natural."</p><br><p>Then, Goran, with a light touch, shook Silvana's hair, making it fly up.</p><br><p>"We'll bring back the past by making it a better present and a path to the future!"</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Adam reached the clothing stores. A few short phrases with a girl possessing a keen eye and enthusiasm were enough for them to start selecting outfits for Adam.</p><br><p>They had left Andreas only an hour ago and had been in the salon for most of that time, only showing themselves in the hallways for a few minutes.</p><br><p>However, it was enough for someone to notice Adam as he left the salon.</p><br><p>He wasn't seen at the Twilight Palace before, so he was a newcomer.</p><br><p>The silhouette, standing around the corner directed his gaze down to the device screen, trying to find out what noble family Adam was from, leaving always the chance that he was from one of the great families, given the color of his hair.</p><br><p>But, the silhouette had one thing to learn:</p><br><p>"Agh...?" the silhouette muttered in disbelief, "He's not a nobleman...?"</p>
