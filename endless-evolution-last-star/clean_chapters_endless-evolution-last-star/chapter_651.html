            <br><br><p>The squad moved forward, straight to the cave entrance as it was deep underground that was the goal of their mission.</p><br><p>Abel was in the lead, Silvana was beside him, but she was trying to keep her distance since Abel took over all the defense of their squad. Talna was far behind, but Silvana and Abel would always be able to help her if needed.</p><br><p>As with all her missions, Silvana listened carefully to her Operator, who could spot more than she could and got information much faster.</p><br><p>'There are about thirty Obsidian Lizards ahead of you. I don't know what the others will decide to do, but I don't think it makes sense to use anything serious in your case, just be careful.'</p><br><p>In response, Silvana only nodded silently, her eyes running from side to side staring intently at the purple energy crystals.</p><br><p>There was a good reason why only three Phantoms of their level could be here. The energy here was different from other parts of the Dead Lands because of the distance of this area from the Citadel and the average strength of the creatures living here.</p><br><p>Crystals like the land and the creature lurking deep underground were filled with spatial energy. Thus, if instead of three Phantoms, their squad consisted of seven or even five Phantoms, there was a risk that the energy would become unstable.</p><br><p>In such a case, spatial anomalies would appear here and would not just transport them to random locations and cause the mission to fail, a few spatial anomalies could simply tear the Phantom's body apart.</p><br><p>However, for the monsters, these rules worked as well. There couldn't be too strong monsters here that Silvana's squad wouldn't stand a chance against, the proof of that was the calm energy in the crystals that both Silvana and their Operators were watching closely. Read latest stories on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Alright! It's time to find out what's inside the caves!" Abel exclaimed stepping forward.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a multitude of the Obsidian Lizards emerged from the darkness, surrounding the confident Phantom who was not afraid to stand in front.</p><br><br><p>Abel's eyes shone brightly, sending streams of golden energy down his left arm. Soon, he tightly clutched a massive amber shield made from his dense energy.</p><br><p>The shield was neither triangular nor round nor rectangular, it possessed an exquisite shape like a crusader with sharp curved edges.</p><br><p>"Alright! Although I'm here to protect Silvana and Talna, I'm also a Phantom and can kill monsters!"</p><br><p>Then, with a wide smile on his face, Abel brought his shield down to the ground with a broadside.</p><br><br><p>A golden wave of energy traveled across the ground, demolishing everything in its path. The Obsidian Lizards hissed irritably pulling out their long tongues, going to defend themselves from the shockwave with their broad tails.</p><br><p>But... None of them knew that this was just the beginning.</p><br><p>The energy passed through the monsters without leaving even a slight scratch on them. The lizards looked amongst themselves, not understanding what had happened to them. They expected to feel something, at least an unpleasant tingling, but there was nothing.</p><br><p>However, soon some of them noticed that there were golden lines on their bodies, left as threads linking them to the earth.</p><br><p>With an excited smile on his face, Able raised his hammer high above his head.</p><br><p>"Hah, it took too long to get to you!"</p><br><br><p>With all the strength he had, Abel brought the hammer down to the ground sending a second golden wave across the ground. As the energy reached the monsters, the golden threads shone brightly, becoming as strong as a stone that the lizards were unable to break.</p><br><p>Many of the monsters froze in place as if petrified, only their frames twitching slightly, indicating a desire to be released from captivity.</p><br><p>'Go ahead, show them what you can do.'</p><br><p>A calm voice sounded, followed by a speeding shadow, like a night ghost searching for its prey.</p><br><br><p>Cutting through the wind currents, the two black blades sliced off dozens of heads like judgment day weapons, the lizards' tough scales no tougher than a sheet of paper.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes narrowed stopping in front of the last Obsidian Lizard. Under the fear of death, the monster used all its strength and shattered the threads, going to fight for its life.</p><br><p>Two long paws curved at a strange angle, pointing its sharp claws straight towards Silvana.</p><br><p>In return, the Obsidian Lizard saw only Silvana's calm, emotionless gaze, she had no pity or feelings for the monsters, she simply had a target in front of her.</p><br><br><p>The black blade swept in front of Silvana's face like a shadow, slicing off the monster's limbs, two paws flying off to the sides, leaving a trail of dark blood.</p><br><p>Before the Obsidian Lizard could do anything, Silvana appeared behind it, a few drops of blood dripping along its wide blade.</p><br><br><p>The monster's head flew off its shoulders like a dozen others before it, filthy blood gushing from its neck, pouring all around, a few drops falling onto Silvana's right cheek, slowly dripping down.</p><br><p>Ignoring the slain monster, Silvana turned around, taking a close look around with a focused gaze.</p><br><p>Abel's attack had hit every Obsidian Lizard waiting for them at the entrance, but she realized that the monsters might be lurking somewhere else.</p><br><p>Talna standing back looked at Silvana, at her posture, cold stare, and two menacing blades covered in blood.</p><br><p>"Not bad, maybe with her we'll finish the mission faster than expected and see what she'll do in the finale..."</p><br><br><p>Abel walked over to Silvana and smacked her on the back with his broad palm.</p><br><p>"Hah! You did good! Nice job!"</p><br><p>Silvana didn't expect his hand to be so heavy and stepped forward slightly stumbling from the force of his smack.</p><br><p>She was slightly confused but then gave him a hard stare with slightly narrowed eyes.</p><br><p>"Sorry, I just wanted to boost morale." Abel lowered his head awkwardly.</p><br><p>"That's fine..." Silvana muttered slowly before looking towards the cave entrance.</p><br><p>Then, Talna appeared between them, she kept her hands in her pockets, having done nothing but blow bubbles out of her gum during this fight.</p><br><p>"Shall we move on?" Talna raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>Silvana nodded silently.</p><br><p>The feeling inside her was even stronger now that she had taken part in the fight.</p><br><p>'Is something wrong...? But what?' Silvana thought, the anxiety only growing, 'I should be more careful...'</p>
