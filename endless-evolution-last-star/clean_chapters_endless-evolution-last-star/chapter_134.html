            <br><p>Adam had been a Phantom for a little over a month, and his start was different from most Phantoms.</p><br><p>After all, he didn't just become a Naturalborn Phantom, he was the victim of an experiment by an influential scientist - Aiden Henk.</p><br><p>In a way, this immediately doomed him to increased attention from certain individuals. Starting with Douglas, who helped him with the documents and history of becoming a Phantom, and ending with Damien - who was curious how far Adam could get.</p><br><p>With Douglas and Damien, however, Adam had little contact with them and had only seen them a few times. However, in his short Phantom path so far, he got to know a lot of people, some of whom had some influence.</p><br><p>Alexia, Zera, Owen, Fred, Katrin, Jena, Hazel, and many others - almost every one of Adam's acquaintances soon found out what had happened to him at Scarlet Light Fair.</p><br><p>Silvana told some people about it, and some saw it on the news. Moreover, on certain websites, it was possible to find the moment of Adam's attack as well as all the gory details in full color.</p><br><p>Naturally, many people wanted to punish Adam, especially the Proud Wing and Azure Lotus members. They were obsessed with Phantom control and equality between all sectors of society. Although these two concepts were already contradicting each other,... it didn't bother them.</p><br><p>Everyone was worried about him, especially Silvana, Jena, and his family.</p><br><p>Louis, Alexia, and Silvana were doing their best - at least being allowed to talk to Adam, but it was impossible, yet. He was at the police station, waiting to see the investigator.</p><br><p>Adam was sitting at a desk, in a small dimly lit room with only one lamp.</p><br><br><p>After a while, the door opened, and a middle-aged woman with long blond hair and a stern look came inside. In her hands were a tablet and a folder of documents.</p><br><p>"My name is Raina. I am in charge of your case. I've checked your history, and I can tell you there was no problem with you before. What happened? Tell me in detail." Raina said calmly, but her voice caused tension.</p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily as he looked up.</p><br><p>"I've been set up. I've told you this before. I'm not going to say anything else, because you won't listen to me." Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>He had been here for more than an hour, so his patience was gradually coming to an end. He was ready to be punished for murder.</p><br><p>Raina coughed and looked at the wall - at the one-way window.</p><br><p>Then, a man with a powerful aura, short dark hair, and an emblem of a blue flower with six petals on his shoulder entered the room.</p><br><p>"This is Prago Avino. K2-Phantom and a member of the Azure Lotus." Raina said respectfully, "He was a major contributor to the gathering of evidence against you and the punishment."</p><br><p>"Hmm? Shouldn't that be up to the judge?" Adam frowned. He didn't want anyone from the Big Three, especially from Azure Lotus influence his fate. He knew Azure Lotus and Proud Wing were in frequent contact.</p><br><p>"Silence." Prago said sternly, slowly sitting down in his chair and looking intently at Adam.</p><br><br><p>Among the K1-Phantoms, he had become one of the strongest - his victory on North Keeper was proof of that.</p><br><p>However, in front of the K2-Phantom, he was weak, like a White or Green Threat Level monster in front of him. They were at different levels of strength, and in a direct clash, Prago would win a hundred out of a hundred times.</p><br><p>"You killed a man, at the very end of one of the most popular fairs!" Prago frowned, clenching his fists tightly.</p><br><p>"Yeah... I admit that the actions of that group are blurry and not completely clear. It's likely that they're not telling us something, since we couldn't find any confirmation of their claims. For some reason, the cameras in that area were turned off."</p><br><p>Adam clutched his shoulders, biting his lip. He realized that Baldhead's group had done everything they could to set him up, even if it would have ended in a less bloody way...</p><br><p>"Anyway, what you did before is not at all as important as killing a man. Dozens of people saw it, and you don't deny it, so... We've already handed you your punishment."</p><br><p>"We?" Adam raised an eyebrow, piercing Prago with a look.</p><br><br><p>"I didn't make this decision alone, but along with the police, members of the Proud Wing, and the military."</p><br><p>Adam's gaze only grew harsher when he heard of the Proud Wing.</p><br><p>Prago sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"You don't have to look at me like that. They were in the discussion because you killed one of them, no matter who he was or what he did. Now he's dead, and you're the reason why."</p><br><p>"Hah, how convenient. If he had hurt my sister or my Operator one more time, I would have done it again. I'm even more sure of that now than I was before." Adam snorted, showing complete disagreement.</p><br><br><p>Prago swung his hand, tossing the table aside and grabbing Adam by the collar.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Adam could dodge the first time, thanks to his reflexes and experience... For some reason, it was easy for him to predict what trajectory Prago's hand would take.</p><br><p>It seemed like Prago was only using his overwhelming physical might, and Adam had more experience than him because otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to dodge!</p><br><p>However, is it possible for K1-Phantom to be more experienced than K2-one?</p><br><p>However, the second time, Adam failed to dodge, and Prago slammed him against the wall with a sharp motion, causing him to gasp in sharp pain.</p><br><p>"Listen to me. You killed a man, and you will be punished for it. It's my job as a member of the Azure Lotus to watch out for people like you who think it's normal!"</p><br><p>"Whatever he did, he didn't deserve to die like that! You're going to jail for six months, minimum! Be ready!" Prago shouted with pure anger.</p>
