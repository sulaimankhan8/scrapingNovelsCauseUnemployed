            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1419: Beast Instinct</strong></p><br><p>Anelez lost. She no longer participated in the battle because she had clearly overestimated her strength. Adam was too strong. For her, he was the worst opponent she could do nothing against.</p><br><p>She was still in the silent expanse and closer to the battlefield than any of the spectators.</p><br><p>Adam and Erada had moved several dozen meters away, but considering their level, it was as close as a wave of the hand.</p><br><p>She was too weak to continue fighting, and her will was broken. She had already accepted her defeat, but she was here and saw everything that was happening.</p><br><p>Now, right before her wide-open eyes, was a scene she found hard to believe.</p><br><p>Just one attack, one black thread that Adam threw like a spear or shot like an arrow from an imaginary bow, had inflicted terrible damage on Erada.</p><br><p>For a Hybrid, a creature that used its body as a weapon, losing one of its arms was practically equivalent to defeat or even death.</p><br><p>Anelez knew this, and Erada understood it just as well.</p><br><p>“I see…” Anelez’s eyes filled with sadness. “So she lost too. Deep down, I felt that I wasn’t strong enough to defeat Adam, but it seems I’m not the only loser…”</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, before the severed arm could touch the ground, Erada spun around. The earth cracked beneath her step as she lunged forward.</p><br><p>For the first time in the fight, her gaze was directed somewhere other than Adam. Her fear of death and desire to win made her ignore the Solar Form’s deadly focus on her prey.</p><br><p>‘If I don’t fix this, I’ll become nothing more than his prey…’ Erada thought as she reached out her hand. ‘I can’t let that happen! I want to win!’</p><br><p>However, Adam’s desire to win was no less strong, perhaps even surpassing Erada’s, as he had already used his second black thread.</p><br><br><p>A tremor ran through the black thread as he raised his hand again, firing a second shot.</p><br><p>Her face pale with fear, but her heart beating fast and her eyes ablaze, Erada grabbed her arm at the last moment and jumped as high as she could.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>The black thread pierced several meters of earth, scattering stones to the side and leaving a deep trench behind.</p><br><p>Erada was already high up, approaching the gray clouds, where she turned around.</p><br><p>Their eyes met. Adam’s eyes were full of bliss while his threads swayed beside him like a calm, ominous whirlwind. Erada’s gaze was wary, but full of determination.</p><br><p>“What now?” Adam asked. “What can you do with only one arm? I know how hard and painful it is. Hah, it happened to me twice!”</p><br><p>Without answering, Erada clenched her arm tightly and, with a sharp movement, attached it to her shoulder.</p><br><p>She did not possess any healing abilities, but she had one way to return to battle, even if it was temporary and very, very painful.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>Electric discharges ran through her body, heading for the wound. With the force of thunder, a multitude of lightning bolts enveloped her wound, forcing her arm and shoulder to become one again, through intense heat and masses of energy that, like living threads, found their way and joined together.</p><br><p>But this method came at a price.</p><br><p>Erada’s teeth ground with such force that they seemed ready to grind to powder, her face contorted in a grimace of pain while her veins swelled to their limit.</p><br><p>Still, by some miracle, Erada managed not to scream in agony as the unpleasant smell of burnt flesh reached her nose.</p><br><p>She turned to the side, and a satisfied smirk appeared on her face. Her arm and shoulder looked terrible due to the extensive burn, but they were still intact.</p><br><br><p>Erada’s fingertips twitched as she easily clenched her hand into a fist.</p><br><p>Sure, it wasn’t a long-term solution. In a few minutes, when the energy lost its stability, everything would fall apart, but that would be more than enough time to finish their fight.</p><br><br><p>Erada didn’t have time to rejoice before a third black thread headed her way.</p><br><p>An electric shock ran through her spine as her body bent at a strange angle, as if someone were controlling her like a puppet.</p><br><p>As a result, the black thread flew right in front of her eyes, cutting her eyebrow and slicing through several layers of clouds ahead.</p><br><p>Now, nothing else obstructed the moon as its light fell on Erada’s face, half covered in blood.</p><br><p>“This…” Erada’s voice trembled as she slowly lowered her gaze.</p><br><p>Adam prepared for his next attack. His abilities were reaching their limit, he had only two black threads left, but that no longer frightened Erada.</p><br><p>On the contrary, the threat emanating from Adam, the bright flames billowing from him in all directions, was just what Erada needed.</p><br><p>The beast became especially strong not only when it was cornered, but when its prey resisted, when it was a real hunt and a fight for life, and not a quick bite.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Erada’s body trembled as it turned red, and the blood on her body began to evaporate due to the excessive heat.</p><br><p>Helasa, like many viewers, was puzzled. She didn’t understand what was happening, but Xander… He didn’t just know what it was, he expected it.</p><br><p>“Hahahahah!” Xander laughed and waved his arms. “Great! She did it. That naughty kid… she broke through her barrier!”</p><br><p>“What are you…” Helasa wanted to ask, but Xander interrupted her, pointing ahead.</p><br><br><br><p>Then, Helasa noticed everything.</p><br><p>There were no significant changes in Erada’s appearance. She looked the same as before, even weaker. Her long hair was disheveled, and her armor was damaged in many places, not to mention several serious wounds.</p><br><p>However… Helasa couldn’t take her eyes off Erada’s pupils. Her round pupils had taken on a strange shape, with multiple twists in different directions, as the sun sign.</p><br><p>This small change meant that her Solar Form had evolved. Only Xander and the other stronger Hybrids understood how much stronger Erada had become.</p><br><p>For Adam, it was unknown.</p><br><p>He could feel it and was ready to experience all of Erada’s power and anger.</p><br><p>“Go ahead. Show me what you’re capable of, beast!”</p>
