            <br><br><p>Under the torrents of wind, Silvana and Talna were falling down, somewhere high up was Abel who followed them a little later.</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes, the pit was very deep.</p><br><p>'What the hell? We've gone a hundred, no... two meters deep already and I still can't see the bottom!'</p><br><br><p>Talna opened her mouth wide and sank her teeth into Silvana's arm, forcing her to release her grip finally.</p><br><p>"Fuck! What the hell are you doing? Not only did you rush in, you dragged me along with you. I'm supposed to be at the end, not in front!"</p><br><p>"Shut up! If you'd keep your mouth closed we'd have less trouble!" Silvana exclaimed with a wave of her hand.</p><br><p>Their hair flew upwards, fluttering vigorously. Silvana was worried while Talna looked completely calm. She crossed her arms over her chest, shifting her position in the air as if she could fly, though she didn't.</p><br><p>Soon, Silvana's eyes went wide as she noticed a faint glow below. She immediately grabbed Talna's arm pulling her to herself and thrust her scissors into the wall.</p><br><p>A stream of dust rushed outward from the sharp blade, hitting right into Talna's face who desperately tried to cover herself with her hands.</p><br><p>"Damn it! Stop it now!"</p><br><br><p>A few seconds later they reached the ground, slowly landing on the cold surface, Silvana was able to slow down considerably thanks to her actions.</p><br><p>Abel was high up, but he too had a way to cushion his fall. His hammer had no sharp edges, but... he simply stabbed the tip of the hilt into the stone, leaving behind a long deep line with growing cracks.</p><br><p>Nodding slightly, Silvana nodded and touched her earpiece deep in her ear:</p><br><p>"Is this how it's supposed to be? It feels like we've missed a few levels. Is the third level really that deep? Where are the fourth and fifth levels then?"</p><br><p>Oddly enough, this time she had to wait before getting an answer. This meant that neither Adam nor the other two Operators of their squad knew exactly what was going on here.</p><br><p>Soon, Adam's voice rang out.</p><br><p>'That's odd. The last level could be the fourth or fifth, but not the third since we know where the third is, and that's how big it is.'</p><br><p>"Then what's going on here?" Silvana asked sternly, holding her massive scissors tightly, the light from the crystals occasionally reflecting in her weapon as it passed over the two black blades.</p><br><p>'Hmm... I have only one logical assumption - the Obsidian Spiders dug this passage recently to move energy crystals from the depths faster for their spawn. Given the size of the eggs and the number of cocoons, that might explain their haste.'</p><br><br><p>Talna approached from the side and lightly poked Silvana in the side with her elbow.</p><br><p>"Ouch!" Silvana gasped, turning sharply in her direction.</p><br><p>In response, she saw a scowling Talna, who glared irritably at Silvana, her hands at her sides.</p><br><p>"And? Who got us here in the first place? We killed all the spiders but didn't have time to explore the cave properly! I'm sure other passages were leading to the third and fourth levels, not here in the abyss!"</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Talna was right and Silvana realized it. There was a lot of pride in her, but she wasn't arrogant enough not to admit it.</p><br><p>"Yes... I'm sorry, I was wrong. For some reason, I've been nervous since the beginning of this mission, no... even before."</p><br><p>Talna wanted to say something else, but Abel appeared in front of her, his broad palm covering her disgruntled mouth.</p><br><p>"Well, this could be a good thing on some level, couldn't it?" Abel waved his hand slowly.</p><br><br><p>"What are you talking about?" Silvana raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"Anyway we needed to reach the bottom level to deal with the main monster, so... we're here. After that, nothing is stopping us from resting and dealing with the remaining levels on the way up." Enjoy exclusive adventures from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p><br><p>Abel scratched the back of his head awkwardly, glancing away.</p><br><p>"Maybe that's even a better option since we won't waste time and energy on the weaker monsters and fight the main one right away!"</p><br><br><p>Talna bit his shoulder with all her strength like a vicious little piranha, but Abel just waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Damn it! Stop shutting my mouth! Are we going any further or not?"</p><br><p>Then, she pointed upward.</p><br><p>"Since I'm not going to spend the next ten minutes climbing a steep wall that was made for spiders, not humans!"</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply before stepping forward confidently.</p><br><p>"Sure, forgive me for my mistake. I will not make it again. Let's rebuild the row and face the main obstacle."</p><br><p>"Pffft. Fine!" Talna snorted, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><br><br><p>Abel patted her shoulder with his heavy hand before walking on, leaving her behind.</p><br><br><p>Slowly, remaining attentive, their squad moved forward through the wide passageway. The crystals on the walls became more and more numerous, and their brightness far exceeded those at the top of the entrance.</p><br><p>Soon, they reached a straight ledge offering a view of what was going on in the depths of the caves.</p><br><br><p>A powerful gust of wind whipped towards them, strong enough to bring with it a chill, lifting their hair up.</p><br><p>"There it is... right?" Abel whispered looking at the massive creature in the distance, lying amongst the huge energy crystals.</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes looking around before settling on a huge shadow lost in the light of the bright crystals.</p><br><p>Even Talna finally fell silent, realizing that disturbing this slumbering creature prematurely was too dangerous.</p><br><p>As experienced Phantoms, they could sense how dense the energy was here, and down below, next to the main crystals that held the entire multi-level cave in place, the situation was even more obvious.</p><br><p>"We came here to defeat that one?" Silvana narrowed her eyes asking her Operator.</p><br><p>'Yes.' Adam nodded deeply, his eyes slightly averted, 'Obsidian Hydra. You must destroy it before it evolves and absorbs all the energy from the crystals. Also, be careful, the Obsidian Hydra is strong enough to cause the energy to become unstable.'</p><br><p>A sharp glint passed across Silvana's eyes.</p><br><p>"Sure. We'll finish the mission in a few minutes."</p>
