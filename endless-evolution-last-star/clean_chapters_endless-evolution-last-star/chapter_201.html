            <br><p>As everyone knew, battles could only take place in four global planes - on land, in water, underground, or in the air.</p><br><p>Sometimes, especially on land, one had to fight against an opponent from another plane, and enemies who could fly were one of the worst and most dangerous possibilities.</p><br><p>It was no secret that a better position in battle could give a significant advantage. When the monster was on top, hovering above the ground, and the Phantom was below - unable to reach his opponent, the Phantom's chances of victory were much less.</p><br><p>However, if Phantom had powerful long-range abilities, it equalized their chances, but what about Adam?</p><br><p>Of all his ranged attacks, he only had his thunderbolt from Third Artifact Trait, but... using that against Iron Stingray was just stupid.</p><br><p>So Adam was left with only one option, he had to reach Iron Stingray manually and bring the monster down to the ground.</p><br><p>"Oh, looks like it'll be our turn to act soon, doesn't it?" Olax asked with a slight smile on his face, closely watching Adam's actions.</p><br><p>Tirana nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"You're probably right. Hell, I thought he'd waste more energy or, at best, get seriously injured, but it looks like our information on him is true."</p><br><p>Olax smirked, putting his hands behind his head in a relaxed manner.</p><br><p>"Yeah. During the Eclipse, he showed his full glory, but it seems the whole time he's been in the Citadel, he hasn't been resting like we thought. It's understandable for everyone that he's gotten stronger, so... A Top-20 monster would hardly be a worthy opponent for him." Olax shrugged.</p><br><br><p>Droplets of scarlet blood that were only a tiny fraction of the crimson streams flowing from the monster's torn wing passed before Adam's focused eyes.</p><br><p>Now, there was no admiration on his face, no crazy smile as he had during the Resonance in the battle against the North Keeper.</p><br><p>He was acting like a professional, systematically weakening his enemy until their fight reached a critical point.</p><br><p>So the Iron Stingray had already lost three of its wings out of six, that was half, and finally, the monster could no longer hold its enormous weight in the air.</p><br><p>Two wings were on the right, one was on the left - the balance was off. The two wings on the left were still enough to keep Iron Stingray hovering above the ground, but there was no way the one wing on the other side could do the job.</p><br><br><p>Adam bounced back, waiting for his opponent to fall. Sure, Adam could have tried to do extra damage to Iron Stingray by simply climbing on top of the monster and attacking it, but that was too risky.</p><br><p>Iron Stingray could just launch an electrical discharge all over his body and hurt Adam badly. There was no point in taking that risk.</p><br><p>'Excellent. I suggest you throw a needle at its head, gradually penetrating the monster's skull. I'm sure Iron Stingray will try to defend itself and fight back with electric shots. However, Iron Stingray will definitely not be able to fly anymore. With three wings, it's simply impossible to do so.' Silvana said seriously.</p><br><p>During the battle, she often spoke some hints to Adam. She didn't control his actions, but she could remind him of something he forgot or didn't notice, this allowed Adam to act more efficiently.</p><br><p>"Sure, even though I'd like to finish this faster, sometimes it's best not to rush. I just need to be patient a little longer before I upgrade my artifact!" Adam said confidently, spinning his needle.</p><br><p>He stared intently at Iron Stingray, preparing to launch the needle straight into the monster's head.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, before Adam could throw the needle, a multitude of flashes appeared above Iron Stingray.</p><br><p>However... only a few of them looked like electric shocks - something to be expected from this monster.</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" Adam's eyes went wide at the hail of attacks raining down on Iron Stingray and tearing the huge monster into bloody shreds.</p><br><p>Then, the shockwave spread apart, quickly approaching Adam and throwing him aside.</p><br><p>For the first few seconds, Adam was focused on the remains of the Iron Stingray, after the cascade of attacks, several silhouettes appeared next to the monster - some of them immediately started collecting genes and most importantly - Essence.</p><br><p>A young man in black and red clothes, opened a steel sphere the size of a ball, directing it towards the hovering above the ground, a dense substance.</p><br><p>The blue orb, occasionally trembling and emitting electrical discharges was the very Essene of the lightning element that Adam so desperately needed.</p><br><p>The Essence seemed to be made up of thick smoke, swirling rapidly around and striving to get to the center, that process was endless.</p><br><p>Obviously, the young man didn't need the Essence or was not allowed to absorb it with Revolve, so he simply sealed the Essence in a special capsule.</p><br><p>Then, in the next blink of an eye, the young man moved away - he had completed his task, and there was no need for him to be here anymore. Their purpose was clear, they didn't want to let Adam develop his artifact, but was he okay with that?</p><br><br><p>"Bastard! Stop!" Adam exclaimed furiously, plunging the needle into the ground and stopping abruptly.</p><br><p>He clenched his teeth in anger, electric shocks covered his legs as he rushed forward at breakneck speed, ignoring the other silhouettes near the Iron Stingray, he didn't care about them.</p><br><p>Adam's speed was frightening, which was evident in the young man's terrified look. He realized that if Adam got to him, it would be the end, and at this rate, it would be in a matter of seconds!</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, black smoke appeared in front of Adam, out of which a figure with black mussed hair held up by a sleep mask appeared. Only part of his body was visible.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry, but I can't let you pass any further. Today is clearly your bad day." Olax smirked, lifting his chin arrogantly.</p><br><p>'Who's that...?' In Adam's head came the first and only question before Olax's foot emerged from the mist, that like a ghostly blade aimed at his head.</p><br><p>'Adam! Defend yourself!' Silvana exclaimed with all her might, bringing him to his senses, 'It's the Phantoms from the Lower Ring! They must be from Ruby Dew! They've come for revenge!'</p>
