            <br><p>No one but Adam knew how his Foundation Artifact worked. Moreover, the wreath had not just become a part of the Evolution Tree but had a physical manifestation, not just a blob of energy.</p><br><p>In a way, Adam's artifact now worked the same way as his initial gene. One ability created his coat and threads, and the other a spiky wreath on his head.</p><br><p>In fact, the first one to realize something was Silvana. Maybe it was because she was Adam's Operator, or maybe she was intuitive.</p><br><p>'I see... As soon as there was an energy release, the first thorn was filled with energy. I don't know if that's making Adam stronger right now or if he needs to make the whole wreath shine brightly?'</p><br><p>Then, she narrowed her eyes quickly, counting the number of thorns.</p><br><p>'Hmm... 72 thorns... That's quite a lot. How much energy would Adam need to fill all of them?'</p><br><p>It seemed that all Adam had to do was to channel his energy to the wreath, but his Foundation Artifact required something else than that.</p><br><p>The Wreath of Hope wanted blood and carnage. If Adam just channeled his massive energy to the wreath, he'd accomplish nothing. His artifact wanted to engage in battle, to feel the earth tremble, the energy quake, and be drenched in blood, no matter whose.</p><br><p>"You..." the Inferno Serpent hissed, Adam's last words coursing through his mind. "That ability you used to take away my right eye... You can't use it again. But, I still have plenty of power!"</p><br><p>Without warning, several flame swirls condensed, unleashing fiery rays upon Adam.</p><br><p>In response, Adam only smirked, rushing straight forward.</p><br><p>Unafraid of the heat, Adam swung his needle, splitting the flaming rays into shivering clots flying right before his eyes. Every swing he took, every leap leaving cracks in the ground, and the Inferno Serpent's flames, filled the wreath with power.</p><br><p>By the time Adam had shortened distance from the Inferno Serpent, returning to his original spot, his wreath was filled to 13 out of 72 thorns. It wasn't enough, but Adam knew how he could speed up the process considerably.</p><br><p>Several threads tied tightly around his fist, clenching his fingers tightly around the needle. He deprived himself of mobility, but that wasn't what Adam needed right now.</p><br><p>'The most important thing is that my hand doesn't flinch... Everything else is pretty easy to solve,' he thought before jumping away from the edge.</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent tried to hit Adam with his tail, but Adam was too fast. Before the serpent could realize it, Adam was behind the monster's neck, stabbing the needle right into the scales.</p><br><p>A smirk was ready to appear on the Inferno Serpent's face before a wave of pain traveled through his massive body.</p><br><p>'How?!' the Inferno Serpent inwardly roared, watching as Adam's needle sliced through his flesh, effortlessly disposing of the scales lying in the way.</p><br><p>Given the size of the Inferno Serpent, the blood from one wide cut was enough to cover Adam's face, and quite a few crimson droplets landed on his wreath.</p><br><p>Instead of 12 thorns, 36 shimmered brightly at once, filling half of the wreath with power.</p><br><p>"Good..." Adam nodded deeply, jumping away from the Inferno Serpent's back, "Not much left."</p><br><br><p>In a slight panic, the Inferno Serpent struck Adam with his tail. This time, he timed his speed and timing correctly.</p><br><p>But, Adam easily took this blow and bounced off the wall, falling upon the Inferno Serpent in a whirlwind of blades.</p><br><p>When one combatant was much larger than the other, it was both an advantage and a drawback.</p><br><p>When the Inferno Serpent was stronger than Adam, outnumbering him by a single step, the strength, defense, and volume of his energy helped him dominate Adam, allowing him to do nothing more than a pathetic crack on a single scale.</p><br><p>However, when the warrior fought against the giant, and they were on the same level, then the situation changed drastically.</p><br><p>Adam was dozens of times smaller than the huge serpent, so he had speed and mobility on his side. It didn't make much sense before because he couldn't do enough damage to the serpent, but not now.</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent simply didn't have time to react. Moreover, even for Risha, a mere observer, it was having a hard time doing so.</p><br><p>Her eyes darted from side to side, trying to follow Adam's movements. However, she only managed to see the purple-white flash pass through the Inferno Serpent, quickly disappearing and reappearing on the other side, each time leaving behind a stream of blood.</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent tried to attack Adam in every way possible, flaming orbs, fire rays, magma blasts or tail swipes, but could not succeed.</p><br><br><p>Leaving another cut under the Inferno Serpent's head, Adam bounced off the dense scales, finding himself on the shore of the lake.</p><br><p>Their gazes met one calm and the other full of anger.</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent was about to say something, but Adam stopped him, he slowly raised his left hand pointing to his wreath.</p><br><p>"What... When did this have time to happen?" the Inferno Serpent gulped, looking at the 72 sparking thorns in fear.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the energy from the wreath traveled toward Adam's chest in two dense streams. The streams swirled rapidly in a circle, condensing into a small star that could fit in the palm of his hand.</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent stared at the star, it trembled with overwhelming power. "What is that...?"</p><br><p>"Oh, this?" Adam smirked, looking at the star. "It will be whatever I want it to be. Only once for one worthy fight... But, now I have the opportunity to choose..."</p><br><p>"Choose what...?" the Inferno Serpent asked in a trembling voice. He felt threatened by the star, all his instincts were screaming for it, but there was nowhere to run.</p><br><p>Adam jumped high up, hovering in the air for a moment and being above the Inferno Serpent.</p><br><p>"Your method of execution."</p><br><p>At his cold voice, the star exploded, directing all of its power toward Adam's needle. This time, his first order became the target of the wreath.</p><br><p>The edges of the needle cracked unable to withstand the power for long. Adam's hand trembled, all his muscles were tense while the fragments from the sharp blade broke away.</p><br><p>He had no more than five seconds.</p><br><p>'Well... That's enough,' he took a deep breath, aiming the needle directly at the Inferno Serpent.</p><br><p>An electric surge traveled along the needle, in one powerful charge unleashing its power on the great serpent.</p><br><p>At that moment, the purple flash brightened most of the caverns, shaking one of the levels of the Red Zone.</p>
