            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1367: Enemy from the Past</strong></p><br><p>The Silver Beacon failed.</p><br><p>The fact that she couldn’t stop some K4-Phantom was humiliating and a heavy blow to her pride.</p><br><p>But now she was faced with the terrible feeling she had successfully avoided for many years after the White Spire fell.</p><br><p>It was uncertainty. She didn’t know what would happen next to Adam, let alone to herself.</p><br><p>“Shit, shit, shit! How did he manage to escape! I should have noticed it earlier!” Bertrada exclaimed as she waved away the mirror, which was now useless, and moved forward.</p><br><p>Step by step, she approached the edge of the glass sphere to look at the dark island surrounding the gray tower on top of which she stood.</p><br><p>Her gaze turned downward as she quickly found Adam moving among the dark earth.</p><br><p>“Tsk, you won’t get off this island unless you return to the tower. Sooner or later, you’ll have to face me, and then I’ll make sure you regret going against me!”</p><br><p>Bertrada was burning with rage, which was evident in her furious gaze. At the same time, Mona, who was standing aside, remained calm, but a slight excitement was growing in her heart.</p><br><p>Sure, what was happening was definitely not good for Bertrada, but Mona also had no control over the situation.</p><br><p>‘Where is he going? This seal… It was created from his and White Spire’s energy. This has never happened before. Is a special trial awaiting him?’</p><br><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam was in the same situation. He knew he had to follow the dark seal, but he didn’t know what awaited him there.</p><br><br><p>Adam rushed through the gloomy trees and sharp peaks, his eyes alert.</p><br><p>“How strange…” He muttered, looking around. “It’s empty here, literally. It seems like all the monsters are under the island.”</p><br><p>Silvana nodded slightly.</p><br><p>‘Yes, I think that’s exactly how it is. Most likely, the surface is a restricted area where only the White Spire has influence, or rather, had…’</p><br><p>Adam’s gaze became more serious.</p><br><p>“Do you think he’s dead too?”</p><br><p>“Sure. The Silver Beacon isn’t strong enough to control such a large territory. Moreover, we know that her real body is at the Forgotten Mills. Most likely, the White Spire was an Ancient Artifact much more powerful than the Silver Beacon, but for some reason, it perished.</p><br><p>‘Still, he was so powerful that his aura and the rules he established in his territory still work, otherwise, the Silver Beacon would have long since subjugated everything here. I don’t know how true this is, but it’s my best theory.’</p><br><p>Adam nodded weakly as she continued to follow the dark seal.</p><br><p>He didn’t know what would happen next or what the White Spire had in store for him, but one thing he understood for sure.</p><br><p>‘The Silver Beacon won’t help me achieve the Desire of Beyond. She’s too weak for that. I’ve already passed all her trials, and I got nothing.’</p><br><p>A few minutes later, Adam stopped as he reached the far end of the island, where, among the gloomy trees and sharp peaks, there was something unusual for this place — ruins.</p><br><p>Massive arches were sunk into the ground, long destroyed and covered in dust. In the center was a broken stone platform with carved runes, emitting a faint but powerful ancient aura.</p><br><p>It resembled either an arena for a great battle or an altar for sacrifice. It was unclear what exactly it was.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes darted to the platform as he noticed dark particles hovering above it. They rose slowly and disappeared with a slight tremor, as if waiting for something.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The dark seal broke free from Adam’s grasp, heading straight for the center of the platform.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the purple light burst upward, forming rapidly changing silhouettes above the ground, from dots and lines like constellations.</p><br><p>One moment, it was a knight in heavy armor, the next a two-headed wyvern, the third a demon with raging flames.</p><br><p>The silhouettes constantly changed and never repeated themselves. Everything happened so quickly that even Adam and Silvana couldn’t catch on and get a good look at even one of them.</p><br><p>“Go, Adam. We can’t go back to the tower. The Silver Beacon surely wants to kill us. Our only chance to emerge victorious is to follow the White Spire’s will.”</p><br><p>Adam gulped and looked to the side, at the endless dark sea that had no boundaries. He saw no land, no monsters, no humans. He was alone, and even Silvana could only be with him in her spectral form.</p><br><p>“I have no other choice anyway, right? Besides, I fought so hard to get all three fragments. I can’t back down now.”</p><br><p>With obvious excitement before the unknown, Adam headed toward the platform while the silhouettes continued to change, casting purple light on his face.</p><br><p>As soon as he stepped onto the platform, the constellation broke into a multitude of stars that soared above Adam, forming a dome.</p><br><p>Lines connected each star, and when the light reached the edge of the platform, completing the structure, everything was plunged into darkness.</p><br><p>“Agh…?” Adam turned around, puzzled as he could see nothing.</p><br><p>He wasn’t afraid of the dark, but this was different from the night or the darkness in his inner space. He didn’t understand where he was or if everything was supposed to happen this way.</p><br><br><p>A low growl came from afar, very quiet, but for some reason, to Adam, it seemed familiar, too familiar.</p><br><p>Adam turned around as his eyes widened at the sight of a monster he had seen once before.</p><br><p>Black fur, like a storm of darkness and sharp needles, covered its great, long body. Two red eyes were slightly open in two calm but threatening slits, while two rows of sharp teeth gnashed against each other.</p><br><p>Elongated ears grew from both the top and bottom of its head, which was held on an elongated neck.</p><br><p>From time to time, its long tail lashed the void like a whip, and a glint ran across the protective plates on the monster’s belly, as well as across the silver threads on its paws with short but extremely sharp claws.</p><br><br><p>Only after a while did Adam gulp as his voice rang out:</p><br><p>“The Silver Weaver… Is that… Is that really you…?”</p>
