            <br><p>Everyone was ready for battle.</p><br><p>The Fallen Ring Castle had fallen into silence, at least for the Serpent Folk who knew of the impending rebellion. For the Light Legion, Kreyna, and Arnoth, it was the same as always.</p><br><p>The knights in heavy armor patrolled the streets, some units gathered resources from all corners of the castle, and some even wreaked havoc in the next serpent's tavern.</p><br><p>It was a normal day after the capture of the Fallen Ring Castle by the Light Legion.</p><br><p>Life around the castle continued as it did at the Red Zone and on all the floors of the Cave Grid.</p><br><p>Of the thousands of Phantoms and hundreds of strong fighters at the Lower Ring, only two had decided to take part in the upcoming rebellion. Perhaps for them, it would be a great failure or even a dishonorable death, or perhaps they could gain strength by giving the Serpent Folk freedom.</p><br><p>Either way, they had no choice but to fight. Obviously, it was impossible to reach an agreement with Arnoth and Kreyna. They were both looking for strong opponents and... Adam was in the same situation.</p><br><p>What would he gain if he made peace with Arnoth?</p><br><br><p>Adam opened the fourth gate through a fight against Vorx and Heret, the same thing happened to his third gate.</p><br><p>He couldn't be satisfied with just talking and walking away.</p><br><p>In that case, he would just waste almost a month and not know what to do next. Only with the Crystal Gates open and the Stellar Flow fully absorbed did Adam have the confidence that he could meet with the Black Swan members and talk to Wilfred.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, approaching Heret, who stood at the exit of the resistance caves, his back leaning against the wall, waiting for the arrival of the Light Legion.</p><br><p>'When is it going to happen?' Adam whispered, looking back.</p><br><p>Yesterday, Heret explained all the details of the plan, today was the day of action. There were not many people left here by the caves, a few serpents, the strongest warriors, Adam and Heret.</p><br><p>Risha and Vorx were hiding somewhere on the castle grounds right now. Torz and Grita were in the same situation, but they had most of the serpents with them.</p><br><p>After all, unlike Adam and Heret, or Risha and Vorx, Torz and Grita didn't have the task of defeating some particularly dangerous enemy. Though not all knights at the Light Legion were equal, the mighty ones would face Torz and Grita.</p><br><p>Heret narrowed his eyes, seeing a dozen shadows in the distance.</p><br><p>'They're getting closer. Five or ten more minutes, I think. First, they'll check the lake, then they'll figure out the resources are gone, and then one of two things will happen. They'll either go check the caves or decide to go back to the castle.'</p><br><p>A cruel gloom covered Heret's face. He was ready to fight at any moment, all for the sake of revenge and to return the castle to his folk.</p><br><p>'It doesn't matter what they decide to do. We will attack them the moment they spring into action. We have to kill every single one of them quickly, without making too much noise,' he whispered, looking at the dim light in the distance.</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply. He realized that this was serious. Even if their main target was Arnoth, the Light Legion could get in the way.</p><br><p>As Adam had found out, there were several groups in the ranks of the Light Legion, but the main ones were the Light Soldiers and the Light Knights. The soldiers were S2 monsters, weak but numerous, the Knights were S3 monsters. They were much stronger, fewer in number, but still many enough to keep hundreds of serpents in fear.</p><br><p>'Hmm.' Adam internally hummed. 'Right now, I can easily defeat even a very strong S4 monster. However, if I'm surrounded by several knights, I might be in trouble. I definitely won't lose, but any injury will greatly lower my chances of winning.'</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>With muffled stomps, the Light Legion squad appeared in the distance.</p><br><p>Heret took a step back, disappearing into the depths of the shadows. The rest of the serpents grew wary. This was the moment they had been waiting for. They would either win or die trying.</p><br><p>The first to emerge from the slope were three Light Knights, wearing white and gold heavy armor and long swords at their belts.</p><br><p>Behind them were about ten of the Light Soldiers. Their armor was not as bulky as they were, with weaker frames but still threatening auras for common K3-Phantoms and feeble Red Threat Monsters. They were armed with spears, long tipped with sharp golden points.</p><br><p>The three knights headed toward the lake, and they would soon realize that something was wrong.</p><br><p>At the same time, Silvana's calm voice sounded in Adam's mind.</p><br><p>'Hey, how are you feeling? Ready to fight?'</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply. 'Yeah, something like that. I'm feeling weird. This whole thing seems like more than a regular fight, it's practically a whole war.'</p><br><p>'The battle.' Silvana purred. 'The scale will be the same as the fight against the Crimson Monarch. Then, you moved alone in the fortress right up to the temple. Only at the very end did you realize what was happening up there. Now, you've been in the army since the beginning, but your goal is the same - to defeat the strongest monster.'</p><br><p>'Hah,' Adam smiled bitterly, watching as the knights leaned over the lake, they had spotted something. 'The important thing is that one day this isn't a real war. Right now, I'm fighting alongside monsters against other, more dangerous monsters. But... an army of humans against an army of monsters? That would be a disaster.'</p><br><p>Silvana didn't answer anything, but from her silence, it was clear that she wanted to avoid this scenario at all costs.</p><br><br><p>The Light Knight slammed his sword on the ground in anger.</p><br><p>He looked at the soldiers and the other two knights, with a wave of his hand, about to give an order.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Heret's frame twitched as he turned into a shadow. The nearby serpents followed suit, attacking the unaware soldiers.</p><br><p>The rebellion had begun.</p>
