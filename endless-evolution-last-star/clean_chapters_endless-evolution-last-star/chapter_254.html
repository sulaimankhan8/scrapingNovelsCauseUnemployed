            <br><p>The next few minutes went by at a fairly relaxed pace, or so it would seem to the spectators.</p><br><p>Time after time, Adam attacked Bladeclaw Beast at great speed using his lightning power. Bladeclaw Beast could do nothing against Adam, only to hope that soon Adam would run out of energy and that would turn their fight upside down.</p><br><p>However... that was not to be. Adam, thanks to his powerful and rapid attacks that didn't require too much energy, but could pierce even very strong armor, was an unfortunate opponent for Bladeclaw Beast.</p><br><p>Adam wounded Bladeclaw Beast seriously too easily and occasionally ripped new organs out of the monster's abdomen, filling the snow-white room with scarlet color.</p><br><p>"Come on. We both know you're already too low on strength. Just give up and let me move on to phase two." Adam said calmly before stopping in front of Bladeclaw Beast and kicking the monster's head off.</p><br><p>Bladeclaw Beast's head flew off to the farthest part of the room, but Adam wasn't going to stop there.</p><br><br><p>With a swipe of his claws, Adam sliced off Bladeclaw Beast's upper and lower paws, leaving the monster's torso without its head and limbs.</p><br><p>Adam did not further wound Bladeclaw Beast, instead he scattered the monster's parts as far apart as he could within the confines of the room.</p><br><br><p>One paw slammed into the protective glass, right in front of Magnus. The girls flinched, for a moment they sensed danger, but Magnus only smirked, rubbing his palms together contentedly.</p><br><p>"Good. I don't know if he planned this from the beginning, but he did the right thing."</p><br><p>"Agh? What are you talking about?" Silvana turned to Magnus, puzzled, waiting for an explanation.</p><br><p>"Look at Bladeclaw Beast's head." Magnus said calmly.</p><br><p>Silvana glanced to the side as her eyes went wide.</p><br><p>Bladeclaw Beast's head was in one place, while the monster's limbs were slowly trying to reach each other as if each one of them were a separate organism.</p><br><p>"Sure, eventually they will become one unit, but it will take quite some time. Bladeclaw Beast has too little energy to do it quickly, moreover, Adam is giving him the opportunity." Magnus waved his hand looking behind Adam who was leisurely pacing.</p><br><p>He didn't want to kill Bladeclaw Beast completely, because then he risked failing his treatment before it could begin.</p><br><p>"Well, given your speed I have a few minutes. I think that will be enough." Adam uttered with a serious face before sitting down at the table, in front of Bladeclaw Beast's heart on his plate.</p><br><p>The monster's heart was large and ugly, beating slowly but clearly alive and full of blood with regenerative effects.</p><br><p>"Hey, before you start, I suggest you take off your coat. Put it on later, it will get in your way." Magnus said.</p><br><p>Adam nodded and did as he said.</p><br><p>"Now calm down, take a small bite first, swallow, and feel what the regenerative cells inside you are capable of. You'll definitely be able to suppress them, but then go to the whole heart at once, and direct the energy to your arm. Your genes are still active after yesterday, so... I'd say your chances of failure are about 10%." Magnus waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Well... I shouldn't expect any support from you. Who talks about the chances of failure in a situation like this?" Adam shook his head.</p><br><br><p>"In the case of success it's already clear that everything will be fine, so it's better to pay attention to what can actually make a difference - failure."</p><br><p>Adam didn't answer anything, he just picked up the knife in his hands and cut a small piece off Bladeclaw Beast's heart.</p><br><p>Bladeclaw Beast was severely weakened, so even the most ordinary knife was capable of wounding his heart, though normally something sharper would be needed to do so.</p><br><p>Then, Adam put a piece of heart on a fork, opened his mouth, and quickly swallowed it.</p><br><p>At first, other than the vile taste, Adam felt nothing, but as soon as the piece reached his stomach, beginning to dissolve into acid, the heart began to grow rapidly, eager to escape.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, one of Bladeclaw Beast's, claws exploded, allowing the monster to grow its claw again, but... it didn't have to be a paw. Temporarily, Bladeclaw Beast could regenerate parts of his body in other areas, this was not something new, so it was within the capabilities of the regenerative monster.</p><br><p>However... before the claw could appear in Adam's stomach, all of Adam's instincts activated, alerting him to the imminent threat.</p><br><p>The energy, along with his aura, traveled outward, pressuring everything around and inside of him. Adam's pupils narrowed as the piece of Bladeclaw Beast's heart inside him shuddered, breaking into tiny pieces that soon became so small that they disappeared in the streams of energy.</p><br><br><p>Then, remembering Magnus's words, Adam tried to channel Bladeclaw Beast's energy to his hand. For a long time, the monster's energy couldn't stay in the human body, but if Adam used it, there wouldn't be such a problem.</p><br><p>Soon, Adam felt a strong burning sensation in the area of his right arm, as if the flesh was trying to break free through the overgrown layer of skin.</p><br><p>But... before regeneration could begin, it ended.</p><br><p>"Agh? I could feel it... My arm was ready to grow right now..." Adam muttered, breathing heavily and slightly disappointed.</p><br><p>"Don't worry." Magnus said confidently, "Now you've just figured out the whole process. You've already done more than half of the Phantoms that went through my method. Now the easiest thing left - increase the amount of flesh you eat by more than ten times, as well as the difficulty..."</p><br><p>Adam nodded as he glanced away.</p><br><p>Bladeclaw Beast's paws were still aiming for the torso, the limbs would need a lot more time, but... the claw on the paw had been restored. Adam realized that Bladeclaw Beast would try to kill Adam again, and there was no way he could stop the monster unless he wanted his heart to dry up due to exhaustion.</p><br><p>"Well, there seems to be no point in delaying the inevitable any longer." Adam sighed heavily before stabbing the fork into the monster's heart and raising it in front of him like an appetizing piece of meat, though... nothing was appetizing about it of course.</p><br><p>Adam opened his mouth wide, plunging the piece of meat inside. Then, with a crunch, Adam used his powerful jaw to grind Bladeclaw Beast's heart into small chunks.</p><br><br><p>Nothing happened for a while, it seemed even Bladeclaw Beast was curious to see the result.</p><br><p>But... soon Adam's eyes went wide and waves of pain traveled through his entire body.</p><br><p>Silvana and Nessa looked worriedly at Adam, while Magnus's gaze went sideways - to Bladeclaw Beast's clawless paws. The monster had destroyed them on purpose, for one reason - to grow new claws right in Adam's stomach, and he'd succeeded.</p><br><p>It couldn't be seen, but... Magnus was completely sure that Bladeclaw Beast's claws had already pierced Adam's organs.</p><br><p>Could he be wrong? Well, sure, but not this time.</p><br><p>"Argh!" Adam's pupils narrowed as streams of blood gushed from his mouth, flooding the white tablecloth covering the table.</p><br><p>Magnus frowned, biting his finger with a great grimace.</p><br><p>'Come on. Don't disappoint me. Your organs have already been destroyed, but they can be rebuilt. Shit, it's not as easy as I thought, right?'</p>
