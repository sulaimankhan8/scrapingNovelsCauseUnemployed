            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1336: Path to Light (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Karso arrived at Norax’s mill, heading to the lower floor where Adam usually spent his time. Narica led him to the room where everything was ready for Adam’s recovery.</p><br><p>“What you did during the fight…” Narica began with a slight frown. “It was too dangerous. If the monsters had torn Adam to pieces, we wouldn’t have been able to save him while he was above the clouds.”</p><br><p>“Hahaha! Don’t be silly, Narica!” Karso laughed before throwing Adam onto the bed like a sack of potatoes. “Considering that the boss was watching the fight, there are very few creatures in this world that could actually harm Adam.”</p><br><p>Narica was about to respond, but Karso beat her to it, pointing not at the wall, but at the Citadel hundreds of kilometers away.</p><br><p>“Moreover, as long as it’s not the distant lands of the Renegades of Befallen Crown, the entire sky of this world belongs to her. Do you really think they’re not watching the Phantom who caught our boss’s interest?”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Narica understood what Karso was talking about as her eyes widened.</p><br><br><p>“Yes, I understand! That was stupid of me!”</p><br><p>Karso just waved his hand and patted her on the shoulder.</p><br><p>“Don’t worry about it. Just make sure Adam is okay. Hah, the sooner he wakes up, the sooner he’ll go to the Silver Beacon! Yeah!”</p><br><p>He left, but Narica’s expression remained serious. Her gaze turned upward as if she wanted to reach the top of the Citadel.</p><br><p>‘Frida… Karso is right, she was definitely watching the battle and is probably watching even now. Her gaze is not something I can sense.’</p><br><p>Then, her face contorted in displeasure as she headed for the exit.</p><br><p>‘Tsk, sometimes I wonder why we are the monsters? Just one human woman, and she controls most of the sky in this world. Most importantly, she’s not the most dangerous, not Phantom, but the most dangerous woman!’</p><br><p>At the same time, while Adam slept and gathered his strength, new trials and opportunities arose for the woman close to him.</p><br><br><p>Silvana gulped as she watched the majestic Energy Axis.</p><br><p>When Adam first saw it, he tried to describe it in detail. However, that was clearly not enough to convey even a fraction of the real image.</p><br><p>Streams of energy ran in a straight line, moving toward the beam at the very end. It was the last 1% remaining for the restructuring, and for some reason, all the threads did not weave together, even though Adam’s energy was more active than ever.</p><br><p>For a while, Silvana just stared at the Energy Axis, at the energy in its pure form and the white-golden glow in the midst of endless darkness.</p><br><p>Then, she looked around in an attempt to see the boundaries of this place, but it was not possible.</p><br><p>“How strange,” Silvana stammered. “From what I understand, the Energy Axis is at the very core of the Evolution Tree, so why can’t I see the white bark at the border or at least something?”</p><br><p>Silvana couldn’t sense the energy flows as well as Adam, because all this energy belonged to him and not to her. She was his closest ally and partner, but the rules were clear.</p><br><p>However, she knew that energy from the Energy Axis flowed to the Evolution Tree, like blood running through blood vessels from the heart to the organs, allowing them to function, as well as Adam’s abilities.</p><br><p>“Hmm. Obviously, I’m here for a reason, but what exactly is it?” Silvana wondered, studying the Energy Axis intently.</p><br><p>She narrowed her eyes.</p><br><p>“It seems that Adam will soon pass this stage. He has very little left, just the last percentage. Does the Energy Axis want me to be here and watch the whole process?”</p><br><p>Silvana’s assumption wasn’t convincing even to herself, but she simply had no other.</p><br><p>Thus, one hour passed, then two, then three, until Silvana began to lose patience.</p><br><p>“Tsk. Something’s not right.” Silvana frowned as she slowly stepped forward in the darkness. “Why isn’t anything happening?”</p><br><p>She had been here for several hours while her real body lay unconscious on the floor in her kitchen, and it had led to nothing.</p><br><p>Soon, Silvana realized something.</p><br><p>“Wait… Considering how fast Adam’s auras used to grow, the threads should be weaving together at a rate of several hundred per minute, but in several hours, I haven’t seen a single movement!”</p><br><p>Beginning to guess, Silvana ran forward until she reached the very end of the Energy Axis.</p><br><p>Even though it was the last 1%, there were still thousands of threads, white and a few golden ones. They were pointing in different directions, preventing all the energy from passing through the Energy Axis at full power.</p><br><p>Only occasionally did the threads tremble, but they were in no hurry to head toward the main line.</p><br><p>The tip shone brightly like a tiny star, attracting Silvana’s attention.</p><br><p>Uncertainly, she clenched her fists and stepped forward, gradually approaching the tip. She knew what she had to do, or at least she thought she did.</p><br><p>“Alright, let’s see if this works.” She reached out her hand, touching the tip.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a slight tremor ran through the Energy Axis, returning back and forth several times. This energy was different from the other, having a purple hue to it, but it was barely noticeable on such a scale.</p><br><p>Then, streams of energy burst out like threads, turning into a figure in front of Silvana. The figure’s body was white, its arms and legs were golden, and its eyes were a delicate purple color, just like its energy.</p><br><p>Silvana couldn’t know for sure, but she decided that this was the embodiment of the Energy Axis, or Adam’s energy.</p><br><p>The figure stepped forward before taking Silvana’s hands firmly in a warm embrace. A slight tremor ran through her body until the figure shivered and disappeared in a bright flash.</p><br><p>Opening her eyes, Silvana found several threads around her, heading towards her hands, weaving into gloves made especially for her.</p><br><p>It took Silvana a few seconds to realize what had happened before she turned toward the Energy Axis.</p><br><p>“No…” She muttered, looking at the thousands of threads that began to tremble more intensely, wanting her touch.</p><br><p>She had a lot of work ahead of her, a lot.</p>
