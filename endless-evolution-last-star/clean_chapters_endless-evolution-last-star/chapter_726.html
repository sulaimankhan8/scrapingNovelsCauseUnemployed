            <br><p>Enjoy new adventures from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana came a long way together, solved a lot of serious problems, but one thing remained constant - Adam did what he thought was right more often than not.</p><br><p>It could be a surprisingly good decision that Silvana hadn't even thought about or a stupid mistake that even a complete idiot wouldn't make, yet it was all in Adam's arsenal.</p><br><p>Silvana didn't begin to think that it was normal, but she realized that there was no way to change it and sometimes there was something to be learned from it.</p><br><p>So when Adam cut the flesh clots, she didn't scold him, instead, she moved on to analyzing the Sacrificial Holders, trying to figure out why they were different from the first one.</p><br><p>'Hmm... These two look like they should. Maybe they're a bit taller and stronger than average, but externally I don't see any significant features about them.''</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Silvana added:</p><br><p>'But... I can't figure out why they don't have vines growing out of their backs?'</p><br><p>Rubbing her chin thoughtfully she continued, putting out her first ideas:</p><br><p>'Maybe they were meant to evolve into wombs? However, there is also the option that the first one evolved using the dense energy of this place. It wasn't enough to get to the next level, but because of that he could get new weapons.'</p><br><p>Adam didn't say anything. He was listening carefully to Silvana, as well as closely observing his surroundings. He was in no hurry to attack the Sacrificial Holders, they were having trouble getting up on their crooked legs, a decent fight was out of the question.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, one Voracious Krigia trembled, three massive petals came into motion grabbing the useless Sacrificial Holder.</p><br><p>Adam took a step back, not understanding what was happening.</p><br><p>The petals were large enough to completely engulf the monster, it looked like the Voracious Krigia was going to devour the Sacrificial Holder as rare predatory plants did in nature.</p><br><p>Such plants didn't have sharp teeth or powerful jaws, only poison or acid, so they didn't eat their victims but rather dissolved them, slowly, to the last bit of flesh.</p><br><p>In that case, what was the Voracious Krigia going to do to the lumbering Sacrificial Holder?</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>With a loud crack, the flower lowered the Sacrificial Holder from its captivity, but the tips of the three massive petals were buried deep into the monster's back, they prepared a place for themselves.</p><br><p>Then, the Voracious Krigia emerged from the wall, leaving behind it an empty socket in which it stayed for a long time.</p><br><p>Behind the flower stretched thick roots that were more suited to a huge, sturdy tree than to a bud, albeit a rather large one.</p><br><p>Adam's corners of his lips turned upward, watching the eerie yet interesting scene.</p><br><p>"Well, well, Silvana, you can stop guessing now. Looks like we're going to get the answer to your question right now, with a real-time demonstration. Superior service!"</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, sharp roots dug into the Sacrificial Holder's back, storming into his flesh. Slowly, the flower unfolded, the three thick petals that used to be wide open began to twist like long lances.</p><br><p>Soon the roots following the flower from the wall fell away, returning to the depths of darkness, they did their task.</p><br><br><p>Three swirled petals plunged into the holes that the roots prepared for them, disappearing completely inside. Thus, the outer part of the Voracious Krigia nestled tightly against the Sacrificial Holder's back, who seemed to be suited to the situation.</p><br><p>Throughout the whole long process, the monster never once screamed or showed that it was in pain, there were only a few irritated wheezes.</p><br><p>At the same moment, as the flower took its place and the Sacrificial Holder rose to his feet, many long vines emerged from his back, longer and stronger than the first one had.</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes, something alarmed her. She saw how the whole process was going on something was off.</p><br><p>'Adam, although the first Sacrificial Holder also had vines unknown to me, they clearly weren't as numerous and it didn't have a flower on its back, just vines.'</p><br><p>"Yeah, I was thinking the same thing."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply before pointing towards the hole in the wall.</p><br><p>"I could be wrong, but I think it's all about the roots. They fed the flower with energy allowing it to shine brightly and be so strong to conduct a... symbiosis with the Sacrificial Holder, but..."</p><br><p>A bright flash appeared in Silvana's eyes as she interrupted him:</p><br><p>'Right! If the two of them don't find a power source, then one of them will have to either die or become significantly weaker. In this case, it will be the flower that will have to wait.'</p><br><p>From the excitement in her voice, Adam shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Yeah, their time as well as energy is limited. Without roots, they won't be able to maintain this form for too long, but, we have one problem."</p><br><p>'Agh...?' Silvana tilted her head in confusion, touching her lips.</p><br><p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p><br><p>Scratching the back of his head, Adam smiled awkwardly as he looked at the two Sacrificial Holders standing before, the Voracious Krigias mounted on the back of each of them, long vines beating the air like whips wanting to break into battle.</p><br><p>"As you can see there are no crystals or runes here, so I am their only source of power."</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Sacrificial Holders stepped forward, opening their maws wide.</p><br><p>"ROOOOAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRR!!!"</p><br><p>A furious shout echoed down the aisle, echoing off the high walls, wanting to instill fear in Adam.</p><br><p>Yet, it only elicited a confident smirk from him as he lowered himself, ready to cut through each of the dozens of vines seeking to impale him.</p><br><p>'Fine, I'm no longer afraid of getting wounded, but it will take quite some time to get rid of them.'</p><br><p>Before Adam could take the first step, a slight warmth appeared in his chest, it quickly grew hotter.</p><br><p>Then, he heard the voice of a second interlocutor settling in his inner space:</p><br><p>[Adam, don't be afraid to use my power... Sure, there are limits to its use as written in the Pact, but, my power is not just energy as in the runes... it is something much more advanced...]</p>
