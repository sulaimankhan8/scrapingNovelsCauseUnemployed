            <h4>Chapter 1268: White, Gray, and Black</h4><br><p>In fact, only a few minutes had passed since Adam caught the golden firefly. Then, Targon brought him to the bridge and healed him with the black root.
</p><br><p>But to Adam, it felt like several days had passed.
</p><br><p>The reason for this was Kara, who tried to invade his inner space. Sure, Targon told her to do it, but it was she who felt the full force hidden within him.
</p><br><p>However, if Targon had decided to do something like that, he would have easily dealt with the energy that tried to attack him at the entrance. If it had been Damien, it would have happened in an instant, and nothing could have affected him.
</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam turned to Kara.
</p><br><br><p>For some reason, he was sure he had just killed Kara, even though they hadn’t fought and she was clearly alive — right in front of him.
</p><br><p>"You... What did you do to me?"
</p><br><p>Kara gulped. She was still reeling from the events of the past few days. She mumbled something indistinct.
</p><br><p>Targon raised his hand.
</p><br><p>"She’s not to blame. It was my initiative. What you saw, Adam, was how your energy protected you from outside interference. You can consider it, to some extent, an indicator of your power. Like an aura, only not outside, but inside."
</p><br><br><p>Targon tapped his chest.
</p><br><p>"Outer Field Energy. It emanates from your Evolution Tree and Path Construct, expressing your essence as a being."
</p><br><p>Adam’s fingertips fell on his forehead as he saw a clear picture of the silver threads cutting off Kara’s head in one motion.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, that sounds like me, like my abilities. Speaking of which..." Adam turned north, where the end of the Glass Bridge awaited him. "I’ve passed all the trials. Now I can move on, right?"
</p><br><p>Targon grinned widely as he waved his arms with excitement.
</p><br><p>"Of course! But! Before you leave, don’t forget that I owe you something!"
</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow, confused. He had completely forgotten about the conditions.
</p><br><p>Targon pointed toward the horizon where the first mill was visible.
</p><br><p>"Advice, I owe you advice. You’re going to the Forgotten Mills to find something, right? And... you can only get that something through battle?"
</p><br><p>Adam nodded twice. He didn’t want to talk about it anymore, but it was obvious to everyone that Targon saw the answer in Adam’s gaze.
</p><br><p>"Good. In that case, you shouldn’t go near the black mills. I’m afraid you’ll face deadly trials there. Hahaha, you can take the risk, of course, but this time I’m not joking. You’ll really die, Adam!"
</p><br><p>The combination of laughter and seriousness from Targon looked really scary and made a corresponding impression on Adam.
</p><br><p>Well, that was exactly what Targon wanted. He wanted Adam to take his warning seriously because he would be sad if Adam died.
</p><br><p>"But, luckily for you, the black mills aren’t the only ones at the Forgotten Mills. There are also gray and white ones."
</p><br><p>Targon glanced at Adam before continuing.
</p><br><p>"I’ll tell you this: you’ll most likely find your goal in the gray mills, either near them or inside them, it doesn’t matter. But! You should first go to the white mills, the ones your energy will guide you to, and ask them for the same advice."
</p><br><p>Adam nodded weakly, processing what Targon had told him.
</p><br><p>Neither he nor Silvana knew that there were different types of mills at the Forgotten Mills, and that they differed in color and purpose.
</p><br><p>Perhaps this advice would save Adam’s life.
</p><br><p>Who knows what would have happened to him if, after the Glass Bridge, he had decided to go straight to one of the black mills. For him, it would have been the end, quick and painful.
</p><br><p>As a K4-Phantom with the First Grand Star, he could not act arrogantly in the lands bordering the Renegades.
</p><br><p>"Thank you. I think this is useful information." Adam nodded.
</p><br><p>"Hah, this is extremely valuable information! The black root was the price for passing further, but to pass my trials and share the fun with me? For that, I am always willing to give something more than just a simple pass."
</p><br><p>Adam smiled, realizing that Targon would not have done this if he had not enjoyed the three trials together with Adam.
</p><br><p>"I see. And, you mean to say that you know a lot about other territories as well?"
</p><br><p>Targon spread his arms with a sly smile.
</p><br><p>"Well, what can I say? When you’ve lived in this world as long as I have and know so many powerful beings, information comes to you in rivers even if you’re not specifically looking for it."
</p><br><p>Adam looked back, taking in the great bridge.
</p><br><p>This place connected two large regions, so it was no surprise that Targon knew a lot from his position.
</p><br><p>"Alright, then I’ll be going. Thanks for everything. I won’t hide it, I had fun too, especially in the second trial."
</p><br><p>Under their gaze, Adam moved forward as Silvana appeared beside him. She could appear anywhere she wanted, but only when she was close to Adam was her power at its peak.
</p><br><p>Targon waved to him. "Come back again! It’s terribly boring around here!"
</p><br><br><p>Adam walked across the crystal surface while Silvana gently hugged him from behind, pressing herself against his shoulder.
</p><br><p>"Garrah..." Adam muttered. "When he talked about the terrifying beast, he didn’t warn me that I’d meet such a fun guy as Targon."
</p><br><p>Silvana smiled faintly, her eyes still closed.
</p><br><p>"Is that a bad thing? The Red Bloom was too weak and not your problem for you to learn anything from fighting her. But... Targon’s trials are a different case. Your path... It is improving, Adam."
</p><br><p>After a few moments, he nodded deeply, remembering fragments of how he had created his last path.
</p><br><p>"Yes, I think I can expand this power even further. Maybe even other abilities? I have to think about it... Energy at this level offers many possibilities."
</p><br><p>He clenched his fist tightly and looked at the mill in the distance.
</p><br><p>"However, now I have another task—to find the white mill!"</p>
