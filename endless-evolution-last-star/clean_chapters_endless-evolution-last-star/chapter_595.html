            <br><p>Normally, the stupidest thing a fighter could do under a hail of attacks was to remove his defense. It was justified if the fighter had some other way to defend or dodge, but everyone realized that Fromund had nothing of the sort in his arsenal.</p><br><p>Arayna's eyes went wide, with a slight panic in her gaze, which strangely enough was noticed by some of the spectators. They realized that through her reaction, Fromund's Operator's reaction, they could learn a lot about the state of the battle.</p><br><p>"No... You can't do that. You're supposed to wait until he's exhausted and then attack... Fromund, what are you doing..."</p><br><p>It was good news for Silvana, but despite standing next to Arayna and seeing her reaction in great detail, she was in no hurry to jump to conclusions.</p><br><p>Discover hidden content at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>'She thinks Fromund made a mistake, that he shouldn't have removed the defense. And, I believe the same. I'm sure Adam won't be able to continue attacking at this pace for too much longer.'</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes narrowed, watching Fromund's slight smile, though his entire body was covered in dozens of cuts from the sharp threads constantly flying by his side.</p><br><p>'I'm not comfortable with his smile, there's nothing wrong with it, but he's too calm and confident.'</p><br><p>After that she looked at Arayna once more, who gasped seeing that Fromund's wounds were accumulating much faster, now he made almost no effort to defend himself, only taking steps to one side or the other dodging the most basic of attacks.</p><br><p>'We can analyze, use the information we receive, and have an advanced memory. But...'</p><br><p>Silvana glanced at Adam and Fromund, her eyes deepening.</p><br><p>'We can't fight. We don't know what it is. We're not capable of understanding how they feel, what they're thinking, or what their plans are.'</p><br><br><p>A bitter smile caused by the memory appeared on Silvana's face.</p><br><p>'That's a good thing. It's good that it's the Phantoms first and the Operators second. If Adam had always done as I say, he'd be dead by now.'</p><br><p>It seemed Silvana's thoughts were unnecessarily grim, but to her, it was simply a reality that needed to be accepted and worked with.</p><br><p>'Fromund and Adam are quite different people, but as Phantoms they are similar. I'm sure Fromund did this for a reason and this one is no good...'</p><br><br><p>Taking a heavy step, Fromund stopped. A cascade of threads was already heading in his direction, but this time Fromund wasn't going to dodge at all.</p><br><p>"Alright, let's see if these two thin threads can withstand this one!"</p><br><p>The flames on his sword ignited even stronger, as Fromund with a sharp jerk jumped high up.</p><br><p>Adam hadn't expected this, the trajectory of his threads wasn't pointed skyward, so the threads just whizzed under Fromund.</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could return the threads, Fromund swung his sword, unleashing all of his accumulated flames in a single slash.</p><br><p>The red, fiery blade moved towards its target, it wasn't Adam, since Fromund realized that Adam would have no trouble evading such a massive and not the fastest object.</p><br><p>But... hitting the silver threads was much easier.</p><br><p>"Heh, it's time to burn!"</p><br><p>At Fromund's words, the blade rained down on the threads.</p><br><br><p>The flaming explosion rippled outward, spreading across most of the arena. Black smoke rose upward, making it impossible to see anything even from above where the fire had not yet reached.</p><br><p>Deftly landing, Fromund spat out a clot of blood and grinned widely.</p><br><p>'Good, I was right not to risk trying to injure Adam, destroying his threads was the safe decision. After all, I can still fight and I'm not in a desperate position to take risks.'</p><br><p>Throwing a glance at his extinguished sword, Fromund nodded deeply.</p><br><p>'I had to sacrifice something, but now that I've gotten rid of its threads, it will be much easier for me to fight.'</p><br><br><p>The currents of flame abruptly dispersed as if under the giant's powerful breath, then two objects came out, whistling through the air with the whistling wind.</p><br><p>Fromund's eyes went wide, filling with disbelief.</p><br><br><p>The silver threads were actively burning, but the flames were unable to destroy their structure.</p><br><p>'Fuck! What the hell?!! Why are they so strong?!!' Fromund inwardly exclaimed, a shiver went through his entire body, 'Damn, it doesn't matter now! I'll still have time to dodge!'</p><br><p>He was right. After launching the flame blade, the distance between them greatly increased, so even with the effect of surprise, Fromund had enough time to dodge away.</p><br><p>But... unfortunately for him, Adam realized this as well.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Electric discharges, in a blue flash, traveled through the threads, giving them their unrivaled speed.</p><br><p>Before Fromund could realize anything, two threads pierced his right arm, his forearm, and his palm.</p><br><p>The wounds were not the most serious, Fromund had found himself in much worse situations, yet it frightened Fromund.</p><br><br><p>As soon as the threads left his hand returning to Adam, Fromund abruptly jumped back to a distant and safe position.</p><br><p>His eyes traveled to his right arm to the two through wounds, though very narrow, the blood made them almost invisible, but the pain was vivid and palpable.</p><br><p>This direct hit meant one thing, no more Fromund could hope to destroy the threads or risk going at Adam directly.</p><br><p>'If those threads hit my chest, pierce my heart, then... the fight will be over in an instant, as will my life.'</p><br><p>A fleeting fear filled Fromund's heart as he took a deep breath.</p><br><p>"Alright Adam, I hope you're satisfied!"</p><br><p>Only a cold voice was heard in reply:</p><br><p>"What are you talking about?"</p><br><p>Adam's gaze showed that he was going to attack right away.</p><br><p>But... when Fromund's eyes shone brightly, then Adam stopped, he realized that now it had become too dangerous.</p><br><p>"You showed me your Initial Order, I thought I could burn your threads, but you ended up seriously injuring me! However! I'm not retracting my words! I will burn everything in my path!"</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Fromund's aura became much stronger when red energy in many streams emerged from his body.</p><br><p>Quickly and aggressively, without delay, the energy transformed into a massive flaming circle hovering behind Fromund's back like the seal of a bright, cruel sun.</p><br><br><p>The red circle shuddered once, sending thick streams of fire down Fromund's arms, vaporizing drops of his sweat.</p><br><p>The heat only intensified, preparing for something more, a battle between the fire warrior and the silver weaver.</p>
