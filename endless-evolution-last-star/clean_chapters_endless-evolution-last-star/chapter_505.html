            <br><p>There seemed to be nothing around Adam, dozens of blades heading towards him, and he should do something about it, not having the option to summon a red sound wave.</p><br><p>Still, he had at least two objects he could interact with somehow: the air and its energy.</p><br><p>The downside of fighting in the training hall covered in amber resin was that the arena was a perfect cube, with straight walls and angles that were impossible to move or affect in any way.</p><br><p>If Adam was in a mountainous or forested area, he could hit the ground and use the landscape to defend himself from the glass blades. In the Dead Lands, this would be possible since everything was infused with energy.</p><br><p>But... here, especially under the glass dome, Adam's options were severely limited, but there was a way out of any situation if the necessary resources were available.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Concentrating all his power at one point, Adam summoned a powerful shockwave, causing the entire training hall to tremble.</p><br><p>The white energy that filled his gauntlets thanks to the split needle came out of his hands as his fists collided, along with the gravitational force that Adam could only use once if two hands were involved simultaneously.</p><br><p>A tiny white sphere the size of a grain appeared between his fists for a moment. Violet energy streams like flames swirled around the sphere as a star in space was ready to explode.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes sparkled, growing wider, as a delighted smile appeared on his face as he watched his new, complex attack created from multiple abilities.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the sphere shone brightly, expanding dramatically in a crushing explosion, unleashing all of its power in active snow-white streams.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Facing the devastating wave, the glass crystals shuddered before turning into dust and disappearing into the void.</p><br><p>A violent shiver traveled outside the dome, heading towards the spectator room.</p><br><p>"What's going on in there?!" Silvana exclaimed with slight panic and alarm in her voice. Everything was calm before, but now it was as if they were in the center of an earthquake.</p><br><p>Riska clenched her teeth trying to stay on her feet, like Silvana gripped the chair and table, the cups and plates were shaking vigorously, and a little more they would fall to the ground.</p><br><p>Even Dahla had to strain her legs to keep standing steady in one place.</p><br><br><p>Splashes of blood rushed from Adam's arms, the veins in his arms burst and the muscles were severely damaged, the skin torn in many places only increasing the bleeding.</p><br><p>But... he didn't even notice the pain that consumed his arms like a fire, because he was in ecstasy, staring at a handful of glass dust on the floor.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Cracks went down the dome, going from the bottom to the top like eggshells that were ready to break from any, even the most delicate touch.</p><br><br><p>Tron snapped his fingers.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the dome collapsed into hundreds of shards, showering him and Adam like crystal rain, beautiful and unusual.</p><br><p>A few shards fell on a blood puddle, the reflection showing Adam's exhausted but satisfied face.</p><br><br><p>Slowly, but with enough force and measured pace, the claps came from Tron.</p><br><p>His expression remained calm, devoid of any vivid emotion, but the act was enough to make everyone marvel.</p><br><p>"I'm impressed. You used several different abilities to create an explosion so powerful that even your arms amplified with Energy Control couldn't withstand it." Tron said seriously, glaring at Adam's hands.</p><br><p>Adam only smiled bitterly. His hands had always been numb after using the gravity ability, but now they were badly damaged, maybe even his bones cracked, he didn't know that since he just couldn't feel his hands.</p><br><p>"Hah... In that case, will you show me your Nexus? You know, you promised." Adam shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><br><p>"Sure, I won't just show it, I'll demonstrate it in action."</p><br><p>Tron ran his gaze over Adam.</p><br><p>"However... You're unlikely to be able to perform even one attack anytime soon, but that's not a problem."</p><br><p>Then, Tron looked towards Dahla.</p><br><p>Dahla tilted her head in confusion, not understanding what Tron wanted from her.</p><br><p>"Dahla, be ready to attack, while I pick up my Nexus calculate the force. I don't want your attack to destroy my arm." Tron said serenely, though he could have been horribly injured in case of Dahla's mistake.</p><br><br><p>She had no trouble limiting her power as much as she needed to, but Tron was involved, so Dahla was worried.</p><br><p>If she hurt him, it would be a disaster of unprecedented proportions for her.</p><br><p>'Easy Dahla... I just need to do one simple attack so that Tron can fulfill his promise. Maybe if I do it well I'll get his attention... Yes, think in that direction!' Dahla inwardly uttered as her amber eyes sparkled with determination.</p><br><br><p>Tron walked over to the stone slab and lifted it effortlessly, looking at the two stands one of which was empty, there was Adam's Nexus earlier.</p><br><p>To the left lay a large black case hiding Tron's Nexus behind it.</p><br><p>Adam watched Tron's every move intently. He was able to successfully stay under the dome due to his desire to see what kind of Nexus Tron had.</p><br><p>'Hah, it's not a weapon or anything like that. Maybe, he has gloves like me too? Or a necklace? Some kind of accessory? Nexus can have any shape if it suits Phantom.'</p><br><br><p>Tron calmly opened the case, pulling something out of it.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>Tron was holding a round mirror covered in a steel frame, two disks of iron chains were attached to the bottom of the mirror.</p><br><p>"Well, honestly I didn't expect to have to do this, but a deal is a deal." Tron said calmly before slipping his left hand into the chain disks.</p><br><br><p>The chains twisted tightly around Tron's arm, short spikes came out sticking into his skin, causing blood to rush outward.</p><br><p>Several crimson streams flowed quickly down Tron's pale arm before dropping to the ground.</p><br><p>Tron's eyes glistened as the energy traveled down his arm, and the mirror of his Nexus went black, no longer showing a reflection.</p><br><p>"I'm ready." Tron said calmly as he turned to Dahla.</p><br><p>Dahla nodded as she took a step forward.</p><br><p>She held out her hand in front of her as energy actively moved throughout her body.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, at the tip of her finger, a bright golden orb appeared, exuding heat, but while normally the heat from Dahla's abilities was calming, the orb emanated real heat like a fierce sun wanting to burn everything in its path.</p><br><p>"Fine, that should be enough." Dahla said before leaning over and blowing like a burning candle.</p><br><p>The orb quickly moved forward, its size was like a tennis ball, and the energy was purposely not dense or even diffuse.</p><br><p>However, Adam, who was standing in the distance, could sense how much power this sphere possessed even in such a weakened state.</p><br><p>Tron's facial expression turned serious as he twisted his torso while putting his left arm forward.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Apparently, Dahla is a bit overpowered, is she worried? Well, it's not a big deal.'</p><br><br><p>Tron stepped forward as the golden orb reached him, crashing directly into the black mirror of his Nexus.</p><br><p>Then... the bright flash that blinded everyone for a moment simply disappeared.</p>
