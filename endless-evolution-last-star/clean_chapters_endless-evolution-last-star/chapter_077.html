            <br><p>The Travelers Squad didn't waste time and immediately rushed into the Golden Searchers Nest.</p><br><p>The Nest was large, so there were a significant number of White and Green Threat Level Golden Searchers here.</p><br><p>Well, their squad had enough power to deal with all of them. Adam didn't even have to do anything, Barna, Sirgus, Mark, Kody, and Katrin were Phantoms who had been through a lot of missions.</p><br><p>Yeah, they may not have beaten their Beginning Monster yet, but that was just a matter of time, not everyone was suited for such a rush and extreme as Adam. Someone needed a smooth and measured development for a lasting result in the future.</p><br><p>"Take your time, I can handle this group on my own. Save your strength for the next ones." Barna said calmly as she pulled out her Nexus.</p><br><p>She didn't have a massive case like many Phantoms, in fact, her Nexus was quite compact, and she almost always carried it with her.</p><br><p>'Hmm? A book?' Adam inwardly muttered, looking at Brana's Nexus.</p><br><p>It was a dark book with black pages and white runes etched on each one.</p><br><p>Then, Barna muttered something, and energy particles appeared above the pages, dense and bright as tiny stars.</p><br><p>Barna stretched her arm forward, and the flashes burst forward, crashing into the Golden Searchers and inflicting tearing wounds similar to the burns of a brutal flame.</p><br><p>"Alright! I'll finish them off!" Kody exclaimed before leaping forward, tightly clutching his long sword with a scarlet blade.</p><br><p>One swing was enough to make the monsters' heads fall to the ground, and they moved onward - along a lonely corridor with high walls.</p><br><p>Barna, like Mark, had a long-range Nexus, she had a magic book, and he had a bow. Such Nexuses had one specificity that would have puzzled ordinary people.</p><br><p>If a normal person saw Barna's attack right now, they would think that she was using her ability or Nexus's Trait.</p><br><p>However, that was not the case. What Barna did was a normal attack, not a Trait. She spent a bit more energy on that attack than Kody, who made a broad swing of his sword.</p><br><p>After all, she couldn't fight monsters by beating them with a book in hand-to-hand combat... She needed some way to attack, and her Nexus gave her that option.</p><br><p>Sirgus had a large triangular shield made of dark metal. In some ways, he was similar to Dargo in this, for they both focused on defense and the hardness of their muscular bodies.</p><br><p>"What a powerful aura..." Mark muttered, shivering slightly.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, it's probably from Prime King. Anyway, we'll get to the target soon, for now, let's keep moving forward."</p><br><p>Travelers Squad's goal was very simple, they had to completely destroy the Golden Searchers Nest as well as collect as many golden eggs as possible.</p><br><p>With Adam's help, they were able to accomplish this task quite quickly.</p><br><p>When Barna, Katrin, and the others were in a difficult situation, Adam would easily rescue them. In his current state, he could defeat two Brass Puppets using only his needle, perhaps even without wounds.</p><br><p>However, Adam did not use his power too often and actively. After all, his goal was to deal with the Prime King, which was why K1-Phantom was needed for this mission.</p><br><p>He only helped the others at critical moments, when his inactivity could cause others to be seriously injured or possibly die.</p><br><br><p>Kody's scarlet sword lit up with red flames as he cut apart a massive Golden Searchers, Green Threat Level.</p><br><p>"Not bad. Kody, you have great skills!" Sirgus said enthusiastically, patting Kody on the shoulder encouragingly.</p><br><p>Kody looked embarrassed, his cheeks slightly flushed.</p><br><p>"Thank you... I'm trying to show the best I can, but I clearly still lack combat experience. After all, this is only my second mission. I'm lucky you accepted me into your squad." Kody muttered with a happy smile.</p><br><p>Adam, standing to the side nodded deeply.</p><br><p>'If this is only his second mission then that explains everything. Well, it's not scary to make mistakes, it's scary not to try to fix them, right?'</p><br><p>Then, passing over dozens of corpses of the Golden Searchers, they headed towards a glowing passageway, nothing could be seen beyond the bright sunlight from the dark room.</p><br><p>Adam was the first to emerge, and his eyes went wide. The ones they fought before were only a test of their abilities.</p><br><p>Hundreds of Golden Searchers stood on the high sand walls, staring intently at their squad, but not as warriors or fighters, but as if they were viewers who had come to the Colosseum to watch an exciting battle.</p><br><p>The reason for this strange behavior was quite simple - the Prime King was here, and he wasn't the only one.</p><br><p>"Shit... So he's actually here..." Mark muttered in disbelief, "I mean, I believed the information from the missions department, but knowing and seeing it is different..."</p><br><br><p>"From the looks of it, it's time for us to step aside. You might not be able to tell from me... but inside, I'm just shaking with fear staring at that monster..." Barna muttered, taking a few steps to the side, looking at the Prime King.</p><br><p>The Prime King, befitting his status sat on a golden throne in the distance, looking down on everyone else. Next to him were three Queens, ready to obey his every wish, as well as all Golden Searchers. He was the greatest warrior of their race.</p><br><p>Theoretically, only the Essence King or some Golden Searchers who had gone through many evolutions and eventually became Crown Type could compete with the Prime King of Golden Searchers among their species.</p><br><p>"Well, well, it seems that in such a huge Nest, there's surprisingly only room for the two of us, isn't there?" Adam smirked, looking at the Prime King. He was fully prepared for battle.</p><br><p>Outwardly, Prime King looked as he should - a majestic version of the usual Golden Searchers, only stronger by a factor of ten.</p><br><p>Prime King was tall, about three meters high. His muscular, lean body was covered in protective dark scales that did not shine in the sun at all, unlike other Golden Searchers.</p><br><p>On his arms and legs, the Prime King had a dense covering of some white material that looked extremely tough, like chitin, as if it were his armor, equipment like humans.</p><br><p>From his back, grew two huge golden wings, unlike the Queen's wings created for throwing blades, the Prime King's wings were heavy and wide like shields.</p><br><p>The Prime King's head did not have horns resembling disks, nor did he have a golden line running along its spine. The Prime King had long golden hair, that looked like millions of stretched golden threads.</p><br><p>The Prime King did not have blades growing out of his elbows, for he had a real, full-fledged weapon. Next to his throne, a huge golden spear with a black tip and white hilt was thrust into the ground.</p><br><p>The spear radiated power, showing that only the worthy one could use it to achieve his goals.</p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily, unable to hide his smile and slight unease.</p><br><p>After all, Prime King was a Purple Threat Level Monster, Red Book.</p>
