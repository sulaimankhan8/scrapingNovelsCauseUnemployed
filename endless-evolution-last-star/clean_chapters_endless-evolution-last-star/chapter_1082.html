            <br><p>Chapter 1082: Twilight Crystal (Part 2)<br>
Saegar and Kenward, the two True Lords, found themselves in battle against over a dozen weaker Lords.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, despite the magnitude and power of each individual Lord, this was not the main event that took place at the Soaring Chain Islands.</p><br><p>The K3-Phantom moving in the depths of the caves and underground gorge was the main issue. Not because it posed a threat to the Befallen Crown right now, but because of all the powerful beings in the region, it was the only one the First Star had decided to contact.</p><br><p>Lexa glanced at him. Their blue eyes gleamed in the darkness.</p><br><p>“We’re getting close, aren’t we?”</p><br><br><p>“Yes. The darkness from the dark route is so dense I have no trouble distinguishing it even in these dim caverns.”</p><br><p>He didn’t mention it, but he was concerned about the energy shocks from above. They were getting stronger, especially after the Lords struck Saegar.</p><br><p>The other wing monsters were following Adam as well, but unlike him, they didn’t know where to go. Once again, they had to explore all the paths around the underground gorge.</p><br><p>This time, none of them would have time to catch up with Adam and figure out where he went because he had already reached his goal.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Lexa passed through a shallow, cold stream and ended up in a remote part of the caves.</p><br><p>There was no path or destroyed tunnel from the crushing path of the crystal, as there would be with the Midnight Crystal. Adam remembered well the destructive power of the Last Star shard.</p><br><p>Soon, they both stopped as the dark route came to an end.</p><br><p>Hovering among the cold earth was a perfect sphere, so black that the darkness around it seemed gray. It looked more like a black hole, not letting in a speck of light, than a crystal of some star.</p><br><p>But… In a way, a black hole was a star as well, wasn’t it?</p><br><p>Dense streams of darkness swirled around in slow gusts, soaking into the sphere.</p><br><p>This was the Twilight Crystal – perfect and beckoning to him.</p><br><p>The density of energy around it was so great that a shiver passed through each movement of the streams of darkness like water.</p><br><br><p>Lexa’s knees crashed to the ground as her eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>Her eyes became wet when the first tears showed, slowly streaming down her pale cheeks.</p><br><p>“Is this it…? Is this the Twilight Crystal?” Lexa’s voice trembled. “I can’t believe it… It looks incredible… Better than I imagined!”</p><br><p>Unlike her, Adam wasn’t as impressed with the appearance of the Twilight Crystal as he was with its energy and power.</p><br><br><p>Because all of it would soon belong to him alone. Not that he was greedy, but the First Star had brought him here through a black flash.</p><br><p>‘I had to go through many risks and dangerous situations to see you.’ Adam clenched his fists tightly, watching the majestic Twilight Crystal. ‘In a way, I have earned this crystal and I have to absorb it in any case if I want to return home.’</p><br><p>Moving forward, Adam glanced at Lexa.</p><br><p>“Are you alright? I hope you don’t suddenly change your mind. I’d hate to have to fight you here.”</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Lexa shook her head from side to side.</p><br><p>“Of course not! I wouldn’t dare insult the presence of the First Star by fighting in front of the Twilight Crystal! I keep my word!” Lexa exclaimed, rising from the ground with a fiery look. “The First Star has summoned you! This crystal belongs to you by right!”</p><br><br><p>He heard the best answer possible.</p><br><p>‘Well, well… Looks like you can work with the Free End monsters, can’t you? On one side, Kenward’s intimidating power, and on the other, Lexa’s insane devotion.’</p><br><p>Adam shrugged, heading forward.</p><br><p>Regardless of their flaws, it was infinitely better than the monsters that would try to kill Adam at once. That’s most, literally all monsters except the Free End, especially the Befallen Crown.</p><br><p>Sure, at the Dark Shore, there are other monsters like Saegar, but it’s a neutral side that, for Phantoms, is usually fatal unless there’s a reason for a favorable deal between the head monster and the Phantom.</p><br><p>“Alright, it’s time.”</p><br><p>Adam stopped in front of the Twilight Crystal, which was actively shaking. The final piece of the Third Key was waiting for him.</p><br><br><p>As soon as he touched the crystal, all the darkness around him stopped. Space, along with the darkness, began to collapse into a circular sphere, creating sharp angles and a shape that perfectly matched the missing shard at the center of the Third Key.</p><br><p>Adam gulped, feeling the excitement of the impending breakthrough to the next level.</p><br><br><p>A thick stream of darkness headed toward Adam’s chest as the Twilight Crystal, with all its energy and ancient darkness, disappeared deep inside Adam’s inner space.</p><br><p>[Conditions for creating the Third Key:</p><br><p>1) Collect four essences of any type: 4/4</p><br><p>2) Receive the key spark: 1/1.</p><br><p>3) Receive the Twilight Crystal: 1/1]</p><br><p>All conditions were met. Adam, in his inner space, watched as the darkness slowly filled in the missing piece.</p><br><p>He needed time, a few minutes.</p><br><p>And… He might not have that time.</p><br><p>With a whistle of wind, from behind the clouds appeared three figures that remained hidden even during the joint attack on Saegar.</p><br><p>As soon as they sensed the ancient aura of the First Star, the three Lords moved.</p><br><p>In dark flashes, they collapsed downwards, piercing the ground with their bodies covered in auras.</p><br><p>Neither Saegar nor Kenward had time to stop them.</p><br><p>The plan of the Lords, the plan of the Befallen Crown, was successful. They had to kill Phantom, and they were going to do it at any cost.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Breaking through dozens of layers of earth and stone, the three Lords found themselves right in front of Adam, who had seconds ago absorbed the Twilight Crystal.</p><br><p>Just the power of their auras was enough to make his heart stop beating and his legs shake.</p><br><p>If they killed him, all would be complete.</p>
