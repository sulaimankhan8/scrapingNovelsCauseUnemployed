            <br><p>'What...? Again...?'</p><br><p>Those were the only two words that flashed through Adam's mind, watching as the limbs of the Phantoms that seconds ago were still alive flew off to the sides.</p><br><p>The flames of battle burned in their eyes, some defending Adam and some about to capture him, but they were all Phantoms doing their jobs. They were human beings first, with a purpose, desires, and dreams.</p><br><p>Now... There was nothing left of them, they didn't even have time to realize what had happened because the lightning strike was so fast that even Adam's reflexes, enhanced by his artifact, didn't have time to work.</p><br><p>"What the fuck..." Tirana muttered in a shaky voice, looking at the remains of her comrades. About a third of all the Dark Phantoms that had come to her aid had just died. However, the squad that stood in for Adam died in its entirety.</p><br><p>The golden protective barrier dome, unable to last even a moment, shattered into hundreds of shards that slowly dissipated into bright lights that seemed to be the souls of the dead Phantoms.</p><br><p>Tirana and Adam were direct enemies, but they didn't even look at each other then, even though there were only a few meters between them.</p><br><p>They instinctively directed their gazes away, only to primal fear from the gruesome scene.</p><br><p>The massive monster that was responsible for what had happened stood in the distance, in the center of the burnt earth, and molten salt.</p><br><p>It was Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon had massive lower legs, long upper arms, with four fingers covered with stone-like spikes. There were several layers of granite on his elbows and knees, for extra protection and better distribution of energy throughout his body.</p><br><p>A long, thick tail swayed from side to side, occasionally hitting the ground and causing a slight shiver.</p><br><p>The monster's entire body was covered with tough armor, in many places with sharp spikes and edged, like blades that could destroy any attack, because the armor was lined with several layers, each ending a little before the previous one, creating the effect of razor blades.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon's shoulders were covered with dozens of energy crystals that seemed to grow out of the monster's body and were his personal power generator.</p><br><p>In the monster's chest, in the very center, was a massive blue sphere that constantly released random discharges of lightning - they spread out all over Thunder Demon's body, along the lines in the folds between his armor.</p><br><p>The monster's head was elongated, with sharp lines, narrow eyes, and two long horns on its head pointing forward. The monster's jaws were slightly open, revealing its numerous crystal teeth charged with energy.</p><br><p>"No... Why exactly did this monster end up here..." Tirana gulped. Unlike Adam, she understood how terrifying Thunder Demon was.</p><br><p>Adam shuddered, he didn't even know what the monster was called, but all his instincts were screaming for him to run, as far away as possible.</p><br><p>"Fucking hell..." Fred muttered, watching from a distance.</p><br><p>"Silvana, what is that...?" Adam muttered.</p><br><p>'Adam, you need to run like every Phantom inside this Anomaly Cluster.' Silvana said with all seriousness as if Adam's life depended on her every word.</p><br><br><p>'It's the Essence Thunder Demon, and it was most likely the monster that absorbed the artifact from the past Anomaly Cluster. Apparently, the Six-Winged Iron Stingray just flew here, but didn't make it in time because it was too late. That would explain why Iron Stingray didn't have an open core of the absorbed Essence, since in his case, it happened quite a while ago.'</p><br><br><p>"I see... In other words, it is Thunder Demon who has the right Essence for me, correct?" Adam asked as his gaze changed, becoming considerably deeper.</p><br><p>'Technically, they are both suitable because they are both Essence Type with the lightning attribute, but yes, it was Thunder Demon who absorbed the artifact that recently appeared here. However, don't even think about fighting that monster.' Silvana sternly said, in a cold voice.</p><br><p>''Why...? This... this could be my chance!" Adam waved his hand, in disagreement. Even if Thunder Demon was a dangerous monster, he couldn't be stronger, than North Keeper - that was Adam's way of thinking.</p><br><p>'Adam! Essence Thunder Demon is the second strongest monster from Purple Threat Level!' Silvana exclaimed, bringing him to his senses.</p><br><p>"What...?" Adam muttered, not believing what he heard.</p><br><p>'Yes, Essence Thunder Demon is ranked as the second on the list. In other words, if North Keeper is Top-4, then Thunder Demon is Top-2.' Silvana quickly replied, 'Even if you were in your prime, I wouldn't let you fight it. It's too dangerous.'</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, several attacks rained down on Thunder Demon, among them were flame, water, and stone projectiles. The phantoms were ready to unite and kill this powerful monster.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon raised its head, tilting it slightly, as if not understanding what these weaklings were trying to accomplish.</p><br><p>Then, Thunder Demon's eyes shone brightly, and the monster rushed towards the nearest squad at a tremendous speed.</p><br><p>The phantoms tried to retreat, realizing that their attack had failed. No one dared to get too close to the Thunder Demon and engage him in close combat.</p><br><p>However... running away from the second most dangerous monster for the K1-Phantoms, was an almost impossible mission.</p><br><br><p>Thunder Demon slammed his tail against the ground several times, causing it to shake.</p><br><p>After a few jolts, a multitude of electrical discharges appeared in the air, cascading destructive lightning bolts down on the Phantoms, turning most of them into ashes.</p><br><p>Adam, Tirana, and the dozens of other Phantoms watching this nightmare shuddered, a chill ran down their backs, and fear began to rise in their hearts.</p><br><p>"NO! Get away from me! Gone!"</p><br><p>One of the surviving Phantoms had a panic attack. He was unable to stand up and just waved his sword in front of him, trying to scare Thunder Demon. A pathetic and pointless attempt.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon jumped forward, grabbed the man with both paws, and lifted him high above.</p><br><p>Then, Thunder Demon began twisting the man's body in different directions, breaking his bones and tearing his flesh.</p><br><p>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!"</p><br><p>The man screamed in hellish pain while the crackling sound of a dozen shattering bones rang out, but Thunder Demon wasn't even going to stop.</p><br><br><p>With a quick movement, Thunder Demon tore the man's body into two pieces and deftly tossed them upwards.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon raised his head, opened his mouth wide, and swallowed Phantom's severed parts like a light snack.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Then, several anomalies appeared next to Thunder Demon, all this time, electrical discharges surrounded him.</p><br><p>Artifacts were ready to be born, and they needed protectors because, besides the Phantoms, monsters were also threats to them.</p><br><p>That caused huge centipedes to emerge from beneath the ground, towering over Thunder Demon as the main threat.</p><br><p>It was unknown exactly how strong these centipedes were, but to kill one such, Tirana's subordinates had to use half of their men.</p><br><p>Being under the gaze of perhaps hundreds of people, given the Operators and military watching everything through the NEPs, Thunder Demon only smirked slightly before leaping high up.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Thunder Demon reached the same height as one of the centipedes that came out of the ground first.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon, just turned around and swung his tail, blasting the head of the giant monster, the pieces of flesh of which scattered dozens of meters away, falling at the feet of some Phantoms.</p>
