            <br><p>All the events rushed through Adam's mind in a single stream, splitting his head open. He remembered everything that had happened and the fact that they were kidnapped.</p><br><p>Abruptly, Adam jumped off the bed taking a fighting stance, his energy and aura actively gathering force.</p><br><br><p>He soon realized that there was no point.</p><br><p>Adam was ready to fight, no matter that Orel was apparently a K4-Phantom, he had to do what was necessary.</p><br><p>However, surprisingly to himself, the surroundings were peaceful - he was in a regular room that could easily pass for a suite in some luxury hotel at the First Ring.</p><br><p>A large bed with a red blanket gave him a nice long sleep, incense burned on a table in the distance and the window was slightly open letting in a flow of fresh air.</p><br><p>"So... Looks like I'm well past the dumpster," Adam muttered before moving back towards the bed.</p><br><p>He quickly checked the entire room, nightstand, closet, under the carpet and even what was hiding behind the paintings, but oh found nothing suspicious.</p><br><p>What's more, Adam's hands still had his rings on them.</p><br><p>'Hm. It looks like they have no plans to kill me or use me in any way, otherwise, I wouldn't be allowed to sleep well and they'd definitely take away my weapons. However...' his gaze grew darker, thinking of Silvana. 'I don't know where she is. Orel or anyone else realizes that I'm not going anywhere without her.'</p><br><br><p>Adam's fist slammed into the nearest wall, shaking the entire room. He grimaced, gritting his teeth with a ferocious look.</p><br><p>'Shit! I should have listened to Erik and the commander! I knew it would be dangerous to take Silvana with me, but... Damn it!'</p><br><p>For who knows how long Adam would have berated himself as he was distracted by a crack from outside.</p><br><p>The wooden door opened revealing three silhouettes.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the first to enter were Silvana and Risha. Adam's eyes quickly ran over Silvana looking for signs of beatings, cuts, or at least scratches.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Silvana was perfectly fine. She acted a little stiff as she approached Adam unhurriedly, but Adam didn't feel threatened, neither by his mind nor by his instincts, at least not yet.</p><br><p>Then, his eyes darted to the right.</p><br><p>Unlike Silvana, Risha was painful to look at. Over 90% of her body was covered in bandages, now she looked like a mummy with only her hair, eyes nose and mouth left free.</p><br><p>She snorted irritably at Adam and stood against the wall with her arms crossed over her chest.</p><br><br><p>Orel was the last to walk, wearing a spacious shirt, wide pants, and a carefree expression. In his hands, he held a huge pack of cookies that were bigger than his head.</p><br><p>His hand disappeared into the bag, returned with chocolate chip cookies, and disappeared into his mouth, then everything repeated.</p><br><p>Orel glanced at the dent in the wall, he shook his head.</p><br><p>"Well, well. Adam, don't do that again or I'll get in trouble."</p><br><p>"Tsk. Like I care," he snarled.</p><br><p>Orel's eyes narrowed into slits, glaring menacingly at Adam.</p><br><p>"No, you are. If I'm in trouble, you'll be in trouble with Silvana as well. And..." his tone became lower. "If it's just going to be some kind of punishment for me, then you'll have your head ripped off and thrown in a dump. The head won't even waste its time to trade you for anything or to sell Silvana."</p><br><p>"The head...?" Adam stammered.</p><br><p>Orel popped a few cookies into his mouth.</p><br><br><p>With a loud crunch he chewed, stuffing his cheeks like a hamster, yet even as he did so he didn't lose his oppressive aura looming over them as soon as he entered the room.</p><br><p>Receiving no response, Adam pointed at Risha.</p><br><p>"What happened to her? Don't the Red Bears have Phantoms in their ranks that can heal her?"</p><br><p>"Of course we have," Orel said promptly. "But, that's not the way it's done. Moreover, my younger, overly fiery sister is being punished. Her wounds will be healed naturally, just like that."</p><br><p>"Agh? What do you mean by that?" Adam was confused.</p><br><p>Orel ignored him once again. He turned around and headed towards the exit continuing to mercilessly destroy one cookie after another.</p><br><p>"You're awake sooner than I expected, that's good. Adam Vinter and Silvana Desio, follow me. We have many things to discuss. You want to know a lot about the Lower Ring and I want to know a lot about you."</p><br><p>Then, Orel stopped, staring into the darkness of the passage.</p><br><p>His cold voice echoed along the high walls.</p><br><p>"But, I want you to understand something right away - you are not guests, but you are not slaves either. The most appropriate description for your position at the moment is hostages. Maybe after we talk, that will change for the better, maybe for the worse. It's up to you."</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, but Adam remained strangely calm.</p><br><p>'Hm... The Lower Ring has its advantages,' he pondered casting a glance at Risha who followed her older brother. 'I doubt that at the Upper Ring, another Phantom would forgive me so easily if I tried to kill his little sister. Well... I'm an older brother to Trici myself.</p><br><p>'But, Orel has no anger or hatred for me about it, at least he doesn't show it. Risha lost to me and therefore she deserved to die - harsh but understandable logic for everyone.'</p><br><br><p>Taking Silvana by the hand, Adam followed ahead pondering what opportunities and threats lay ahead of him.</p><br><p>He followed Orel down the long passage, peering at his back.</p><br><p>'The Lower Ring is smaller than the Upper Ring, it's clear from the fact that there are only four major organizations here while up there are the Twelve Branches and the Big Three.</p><br><p>'If at the Alderran Family the elders are the K4-Phantoms at the brink of evolution, then Orel must be something like number two or number three at the Red Bears, right? Assuming their leader is the Second Rank Phantom.'</p><br><p>Adam's eyes filled with determination.</p><br><p>'In that case, I need to establish a good relationship with him. A man of his level can help me get to the Black Swan and Wilfred.'</p>
