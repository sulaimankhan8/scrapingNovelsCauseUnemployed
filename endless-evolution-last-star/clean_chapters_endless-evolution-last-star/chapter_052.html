            <h3>Chapter 52  First Ring (Part 3)</h3><br><p>Adam had gone from one state to another, and now, he needed to change again as he approached Amber Ocean. </p><br><p>It was a three-story building in an eastern style with blue pagoda-like tiles and pointed peaks. In place of the walls was amber glass reflecting the light of the night streets, complementing the very center of the Citadel. </p><br><p>Every minute someone entered the Amber Ocean. They were wealthy men in expensive suits and women in luxurious dresses. This place screamed that it was only for the elite. </p><br><p>Not far from the entrance, there was a tall girl with long purple hair. She cast a stern, annoyed look at the passersby, but as soon as she saw Adam, she changed completely. </p><br><p>"Adam! Did something happen on the way?" Jena asked for Adam was a little late. </p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head. </p><br><p>"Well... Nothing serious. It's just that the first time you use the subway, it takes a while to figure things out." </p><br><p>Jena blinked a few times, then she smiled understandingly and took Adam's hand. They approached the entrance, talking about something. </p><br><p>In the background, they looked like a young couple who didn't belong in such an upscale restaurant. </p><br><p>The hostess standing in front of the restaurant frowned slightly. Jena was dressed acceptably, but Adam was absolutely not, there was a huge gap between him and the man in a suit. </p><br><p>However, when Adam raised his hand, scratching back of his head and laughing slightly, his sleeve fell down revealing the bracelet on his wrist. </p><br><p>As soon as the girl saw Adam's NEP, her eyes went wide, and her expression changed. She was now smiling broadly as if she had the most important guests heading her way. </p><br><p>"Good evening. I welcome you to Amber Ocean! Do you have a reservation?" </p><br><br><p>"Damn... I didn't think of that at all." </p><br><p>Adam wanted to say something else because he had to remedy the situation somehow, but the girl beat him to it. </p><br><p>"Oh, you don't have to worry about that! We always have a few free tables on the second floor for the Phantoms. Would that be okay with you?" </p><br><p>"Yeah, sure." Adam hastily replied. As if he had a choice. It was already a great stroke of luck that Amber Ocean had been so considerate. </p><br><p>In fact, it wasn't just Amber Ocean. Almost all high-end stores, restaurants, banks, and so on were trying to do extra favors for the Phantoms. Naturally, to a large extent it was done out of selfish thoughts, it was profitable to have a good relationship with the Phantoms. </p><br><p>However, to some extent, they did so because they were truly grateful for what the Phantoms were doing. After all, if it weren't for them, there would be no restaurants, no stores, no Citadel. The monsters would have destroyed everything in their path, and no one would have stopped them. </p><br><p>Step. Step. Another Step. </p><br><p>Following the girl, Adam and Jena went up to the second floor, approaching the table next to the window. </p><br><p>They attracted attention, at first, they looked puzzled. </p><br><p>'What was that inappropriately dressed guy doing here?' </p><br><p>Many thought exactly that. </p><br><p>However, they soon realized that he was a Phantom, and a few people even recognized him. They might have wanted to approach and ask something, but the people visiting Amber Ocean knew what manners were. </p><br><p>Half an hour later, their table was full of various dishes and cocktails. Adam had a variety of shrimp and meat, while Jena decided to indulge in salads, although it wasn't exactly her choice... Silvana had put her on a strict diet to get faster results. </p><br><p>"Hah, I feel like I'm in heaven. This... this is just great!" Adam said joyfully like a child. </p><br><p>Jena said nothing, for the pure joy emanating from Adam needed no words, it was complete and genuine. Such a thing was not often seen in a world built on competition and blood. Soon, the young man sitting at the opposite table got up and walked towards them, a wry smile on his face. </p><br><p>"Well, well, if it isn't Adam Vinter? A newcomer that has managed to make some noise." A young man with short black hair and green eyes said confidently. Adam raised an eyebrow, turned, and asked, "Do I know you?" </p><br><p>The young man shook his head. </p><br><p>"Nah, my name is Oscar Hunt, though it's rather insulting that you don't know my name though I know yours." </p><br><br><p>"Hey, we're actually on a date. Could you please get out of our way? It's fucking rude, you know?" </p><br><p>Oscar furrowed, his gaze growing colder and the look directed at Jena filled with contempt. </p><br><p>"Oh, so this is your girlfriend? I'm not judging you for choosing an ordinary human, but in that case, you should have taken someone sexier. Look, take an example from me." Oscar said, pointing to his table where the girl was sitting. </p><br><p>Adam frowned slightly, but not because of Oscar's words, but rather at the way the girl looked - like a doll with a ton of makeup, an overly revealing dress, and a silly face. No naturalness or authenticity, just pure lust with nothing behind it. </p><br><p>"Whatever, did you want something? My food's getting cold, and it's pretty expensive here." Adam waved his hand. </p><br><br><p>"I want to fight you. You know, there's been a lot of rumors about you among the Phantom newbies. You suddenly appeared, just out of nowhere, and immediately got into various trouble and survived every time! You're not from the nobility, have no bloodline, and come from the slums, but your fights against Brass Puppet have become incredibly popular." </p><br><p>Then, Oscar bent over, staring intently into Adam's eyes. </p><br><p>"However, a lot of people also think that you were just lucky and survived because of the sacrifices of others. You know, you even have an unofficial title now - The Last Survivor. Most of the people around you died violently. I want to show that you're just an ordinary Phantom who was lucky enough to get the Spark. You were born in the slums, and you'll always be a part of them." </p><br><p>Adam listened carefully, a sly smile already appearing on Oscar's face. </p><br><p>Then, Adam shrugged. </p><br><p>"I'm not interested in that. Good luck finding an opponent." </p><br><p>Oscar's eyes went wide in confusion. He was sure he'd done enough to provoke Adam. </p><br><p>"Pffft! You're nothing but a pathetic coward! I'm sure that's why you came here with that ugly girl since you know you don't deserve any better! You and your family are just as worthless as you were before! When you die they will all go back to the slums!" </p><br><p>Jena clenched her fist tightly, her teeth gritting and her veins swelling with anger. If she could she would have punched Oscar right in the face by now. </p><br><p>Oscar smiled contentedly. His plan had worked perfectly! Jena was seething with rage, which meant... </p><br><p>'What...? What the fuck?!' Oscar inwardly exclaimed in disbelief from Adam's calm look. </p><br><p>"And? What did you expect? That I'd get up and start fighting you?" Adam raised an eyebrow. </p><br><p>"But... Are you really so pathetic that you would let someone insult your family?!" Oscar exclaimed. </p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily. </p><br><p>"You're a fucking clown, that's it. I've heard more insults in the slums than you can utter in your whole pathetic life. If I were to attack you, I'd do as you wish, nothing more. Also, you've embarrassed yourself enough already, I don't need to do anything." Adam said coldly, casting a glance around the hall. </p><br><p>Oscar's performance could not go unnoticed. </p><br><p>People were looking at him with obvious disapproval, even if they didn't hear what he said, his noise disturbing the others. </p><br><p>"However, even if you are an asshole, I might consider your offer." </p><br><p>Oscar's eyes narrowed. </p><br><p>"I knew that hurt your feelings! I'm ready to fight you tonight and destroy you! I will prove that Phantoms without bloodlines are nothing!" Oscar exclaimed happily, anticipating his victory. </p><br><p>Adam reached forward, rubbing his thumb and finger like a merchant. </p><br><p>"Agh...?" Oscar raised an eyebrow in confusion. </p><br><p>"Pay up. You need this fight, not me. You live in First Ring and so dependent on the idea of bloodlines, you must be from a wealthy family. If you want to fight me, I demand 50.000 credits, otherwise never bother me again if you are not even capable of that." Adam said confidently, he had nothing to lose. He could manipulate Oscar any way he wanted, Oscar's dignity was now on the line. Oscar clenched his fists tightly, gritted his teeth, and uttered, "Fine... In three days. In Arena A-03, I will tear you apart!" </p><br><p>Adam extended his hand with his ID open at the NEP. Oscar transferred the money and annoyed returned to his table. </p><br><p>"Adam... Are you really going to fight...?" Jena, shocked by what happened, asked. </p><br><p>"Sure, why not? After the battle with Crown Type, I realized I needed some combat experience against such opponents. Moreover, I just earned more than I had. That's a hell of a bargain. Maybe I should go work as a manager, what do you think?" </p><br><p>Jena only sighed heavily, then she smiled slightly. What Adam had done was clever, it made her even more eager to get it! </p><br><p>At this time Adam was enjoying his meal as if nothing had happened. As a man from the slums, he was practically immune to such manipulation. </p><br><p>The date progressed at a good pace, and when the sky was covered in stars with a shining moon, it was time for Jena to do what she wanted for a long while.</p>
