            <br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With a slight shudder, the fighter soared above the ground, quickly gaining a smooth and steady speed.</p><br><p>The pilot, sitting in a separate cockpit reported into the microphone.</p><br><p>"Alright, Obsidian Squad, we'll be in a position in forty minutes. I can't land, that area is too dangerous, any failure and the fighter will be destroyed, so you'll have to jump. Don't worry, I'll go as low as I can."</p><br><p>Abel took a deep breath, looking forward with a bright gaze.</p><br><p>"Well, we just have to wait, don't we?" He turned, looking at Silvana and Talna, who were sitting across from each other.</p><br><p>Instead of apologizing for her behavior earlier Talna only continued what she had started. She ran her hands over her flat chest, got a sad face, then raised her gaze to Silvana's chest and narrowed her eyes menacingly.</p><br><p>In response, Silvana only shook her leg nervously, trying to figure out what was wrong with Talna.</p><br><p>'Shit, you fucking pervert! Instead of saying hello or asking something about the mission she decided to make a comment about my breasts. What's more, why am I even thinking about it!!!?'</p><br><p>Then, came a calm, familiar voice that sounded familiar to her.</p><br><p>'Is everything okay?' Adam asked, being many kilometers away from Silvana like any Operator, 'You look tense and nervous.'</p><br><p>"Well..." Silvana whispered, "I just can't figure out what's wrong with Talna. Can you even trust her? I mean... I don't doubt your search skills, but she's very strange..."</p><br><p>'I know what you're talking about, after all, I heard everything, just ignore it. She says what she thinks, and as you can see, shame or tact is unknown to her.'</p><br><p>Silence fell for a few seconds, then Adam serenely said.</p><br><p>'And stop thinking about what she says. You have great medium-sized breasts. The fact that she's jealous is her business.'</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Silvana's face turned as red as a tomato, she clearly wasn't ready to hear such a thing. She didn't even know if it was a taunt or not since she was usually the only one who made jokes about him.</p><br><p>"Shut up! That's not something you should be talking about during a mission! Why is anyone even discussing my breasts!"</p><br><p>It wasn't until a few seconds later that Silvana realized she spoke loudly, it was already too late to lower her tone.</p><br><p>Abel and Talna looked at her wide-eyed.</p><br><p>Then, Talna pointed at her, looking at Abel with an indignant expression.</p><br><p>"Damn! They put a pervert in our fighter. We're flying a mission, and she's discussing her big tits with her Operator! No professionalism whatsoever!"</p><br><p>Not knowing what to reply, Abel just smiled awkwardly, scratching the back of his head. He was already on the same team with them, but he didn't want to get between two fires.</p><br><br><p>Silvana clenched her fists tightly, gritting her teeth in anger.</p><br><p>'Fine... Once we complete the mission I will make you answer for your words, you... you... little, insolent, flat bitch!'</p><br><p>She didn't say anything, but Adam knew Silvana well enough to know what she was thinking right now.</p><br><p>"Agh..." Adam sighed heavily, eyeing the many screens in front of him, "She could just ignore this situation, but instead she's only thinking about Talna's words. Well, when they meet the monsters, they won't have much time to talk."</p><br><p>The next half hour passed in silence. Stay connected via My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Unwilling to let the situation go, Silvana continued to stare irritably at Talna, receiving the same looks in return.</p><br><p>It seemed that the worst of the situation was Abel, as he would rather spend his time having a warm, pleasant conversation than being in tense silence.</p><br><p>Soon, they heard their pilot's voice again.</p><br><p>"Hey guys, get ready to jump and... good luck to you. I hear this is a dangerous and important mission."</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the fighter descended sharply, revealing a massive ramp. Brutal torrents of wind rushed in, fluttering Silvana's hair tips who rose from her seat first.</p><br><p>Soon, Abel and Talna appeared behind her. They were all experienced Phantoms and realized that when it was time for a mission, they had to think only of their goal, everything that happened before or would happen afterward became irrelevant.</p><br><p>Beneath them waited a dark land covered in a dense layer of black sand, massive stone cliffs showing outward, sharp peaks pointing upward like formidable spires.</p><br><p>Not as common, but amongst the rocks were purple energy crystals of smaller size, but of much greater value. They were full of energy as was evident by their bright glow, the only light source in this region.</p><br><p>Silvana raised her gaze, looking at the thick dark clouds that did not let in a single ray of light. There were no electrical discharges among the clouds to indicate an impending storm or shadows from flying monsters, just an oppressive silence - sometimes that was the most dangerous of all.</p><br><p>In the very center of the area, where the number of stone peaks and energy crystals condensed, there was a formidable hill: several massive stone pillars jutted their tops into each other, creating a void beneath them that led deep into the ground.</p><br><br><p>Talna stepped forward whizzing by Silvana's side, she kept chewing her gum, another one, it seemed like she never ran out of them.</p><br><p>"Stop standing around like idiots! If we wait any longer, we'll have to walk there!"</p><br><p>With those words Talna jumped down, intending to open her parachute later. Maybe the monsters from the cave would destroy her parachute, or she'd be unlucky enough to hit a rock peak, but she didn't care, since a Phantom of her level only needed temporary deceleration to fall from such a height without injury.</p><br><p>Abel and Silvana exchanged glances, nodded, and took the black cases off the walls - their Nexuses, for some reason, Talna didn't have one with her.</p><br><p>Clutching the cases tightly in their hands, they jumped off at the same time. For a moment Silvana's eyes twitched to the side, looking curiously at Abel's case that was massive and tall, though her one was no small size either.</p><br><p>Then, sensing the approach of three powerful creatures from the entrance to the cave a cluster of violet eyes showed.</p><br><p>They clearly had no intention of letting the intruders disturb them, as the main monster had almost completed the process of approaching its target.</p>
