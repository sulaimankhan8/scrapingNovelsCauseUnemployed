            <h4>Chapter 1350: Hunter’s Dagger (Part 2)</h4><br><p>A few seconds ago, the Silver Gargoyle had been staring intently at Adam, hoping that the lesser gargoyles would be able to wound him, capture him, or at least slow him down. In that case, his defeat would have been a foregone conclusion.
</p><br><p>However, now, they were both looking not at each other, but at the short, one-handed handle in the floating rock. The energy from the Imaginary Cut still lingered as the rock slowly drifted away.
</p><br><p>What should you do when the only way your enemy could defeat you was with a specific weapon?
</p><br><p>Well, it was quite simple. You had to do everything to prevent your enemy from getting that weapon. To do this, you had to kill the enemy either, destroy the weapon, or... take the weapon for yourself, which was the easiest and quickest solution.
</p><br><p>The Silver Gargoyle understood this well as its eyes paused on Adam for a moment before fixing on the handle.
</p><br><p>Without hesitation, the Silver Gargoyle spread its wings wide and, with a broad sweep, rushed straight towards the rock.
</p><br><p>It was impossible to destroy this weapon, otherwise, Adam would have had no chance of passing the first trial. However, if the Silver Gargoyle blocked Adam’s access to it, he would lose his only chance.
</p><br><p>It was obvious that the Silver Gargoyle significantly surpassed Adam in speed. Even with the Dual Resonance, Adam was unable to outrun the Silver Gargoyle, especially in the air.
</p><br><p>He understood this, as did the Silver Gargoyle, as a satisfied smirk slowly appeared on its face.
</p><br><p>The monster’s eyes reflected the handle, which grew larger and larger as it approached the coveted weapon.
</p><br><p>The Silver Gargoyle stretched out its hand, and in another second, it would touch the handle, basically saving itself from defeat.
</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, the silver threads wrapped around the rock, removing it from the Silver Gargoyle’s trajectory.
</p><br><p>The monster flew forward several meters on momentum before spreading its wings wide and coming to a stop.
</p><br><br><p>Shocked, the Silver Gargoyle turned to look at the rock with the handle, which was getting further and further away.
</p><br><p>Soon, the Silver Gargoyle saw two spinning disks on Adam’s hands and understood what was happening.
</p><br><p>"Hahaha! Did you really think I would give you my ticket to victory so easily?" Adam exclaimed in excitement, pulling the rock toward him.
</p><br><p>The Silver Gargoyle flapped its wings in an attempt to stop Adam, but it was too late.
</p><br><p>Before the Silver Gargoyle’s claws could scratch the rock, Adam grabbed the dusty hilt that had been buried under the island for who knows how long.
</p><br><p>A bright red light burst from the cracks as a high-speed energy burst threw the Silver Gargoyle and Adam in different directions.
</p><br><p>Shocked, Adam blinked several times as he looked down at the long dagger with a dark, curved blade. Several red runes glowed brightly on the blade as crimson energy flowed along its sharp edges like a stream.
</p><br><p>[Dagger of the Dark Hunter
</p><br><p>A dagger used by a hunter who hunted at night and used blood, both his own and that of his enemies. Thanks to the power of the runes carved directly onto the blade, the dagger is capable of inflicting a cut that will slice through any obstacle. Most often, the hunter used this feature not to defeat the beast, but to cut off particularly valuable and hard-to-reach trophies.]
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes flashed as he immediately swung the dagger, cutting his own palm.
</p><br><p>"Hah, let’s see what this dagger is capable of!"
</p><br><p>As soon as the first drops of blood fell on the dark blade, the runes on the blade trembled as a stream of dense energy flowed out of the dagger towards Adam.
</p><br><p>The Silver Gargoyle shuddered. As a guard of this trial, it knew what this dagger was capable of and what Adam had to do to win and move on at the White Spire. Obviously, the Silver Gargoyle did not want this to happen, but things had already gone too far to change anything.
</p><br><p>The energy from the dagger reached Adam’s eyes, covering them with red flames that changed his perception of the world.
</p><br><p>Now, instead of a white void and a destroyed bridge, everything was black with thin white outlines. The lesser gargoyles in the distance turned yellow, and the Silver Gargoyle was bright red, except for one point—the fang in its jaw glowed bright amber, becoming Adam’s point of attack.
</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward as his frame trembled and all the energy from the dagger burst out, leaving behind a dark, gloomy trail showing that he was now the hunter here, even if only for one attack.
</p><br><p>The Silver Gargoyle’s instincts kicked in with full force, reminding it that only this dagger was capable of harming it.
</p><br><br><p>The monster roared in an attempt to escape, but Adam moved too fast. With a red burst, he found himself right in front of the Silver Gargoyle.
</p><br><p>For a split second, their eyes met, but it was enough for a shiver to run through the proud gargoyle.
</p><br><br><p>Blood gushed from the Silver Gargoyle’s jaw as a wave of pain ran through the great monster that was now capable of fighting on equal terms against the Lords.
</p><br><p>It was the first time Adam had been able to wound the Silver Gargoyle in their long battle, but his real achievement lay elsewhere.
</p><br><p>"Hah, so this is what you look like." Adam grinned as he looked at the long, black fang in his hand, while drops of blood dripped from its tip.
</p><br><p>Adam glanced toward the gate and nodded deeply. It was a perfect match.
</p><br><p>Humiliated and suffering from pain, the Silver Gargoyle wanted nothing more than to take revenge on Adam.
</p><br><p>"GRRRRHAAAA!" The monster growled furiously with rage, staring at Adam. Now nothing was holding it back, because Adam had spent one slash of the dagger.
</p><br><p>Adam turned sharply with a frown, ready for battle and already looking for a way to reach the gate to finish the trial.
</p><br><br><p>Strike. Strike. Strike.
</p><br><p>Three bright flashes from above fell on the Silver Gargoyle, gradually depriving it of its strength. Three silver wing signs disappeared from the monster’s chest, as did a significant part of its strength.
</p><br><p>Adam turned toward the White Spire as the gate shook once, as did the fang in his hand.
</p><br><p>Now, the path was clear.</p>
