            <br><p>Each of the nine wings was an area in the First Ring, and besides the many roads leading to them, there were also main entrances.</p><br><p>Usually, it made no difference how one entered a particular wing, but if a visit was to the ninth wing, it was recommended to do so through one of the two main entrances, most often for security reasons and... because of problems with the other wings.</p><br><p>One main entrance was in front of the circular road starting at the end of all wings, from where one could get to any wing.</p><br><p>The second entrance was on the side of the Second Ring, and these entrances were less restrictive and wider.</p><br><p>Right now, Adam, Gladius, and the others were riding straight toward the first type of entrance.</p><br><p>They were driving on a lonely, wide road, with no other cars besides them. A few tall lampposts every twenty meters illuminated the way with a bright, distinct white light.</p><br><p>There was nothing around the road.</p><br><p>That small piece of land belonging to the ninth wing was like a wasteland, with dark earth and dry trees bearing sharp branches, no one had taken care of them or the terrain.</p><br><p>It seemed that this was done on purpose, for as the car approached the entrance, the situation changed.</p><br><p>The massive steel gate was firmly sealed, in the center was a complex circular lock with five pistons, if they did not move the gate would not even budge.</p><br><p>The gate was several dozen meters high, it could rival some skyscrapers that didn't have a hundred floors.</p><br><p>The width was great enough that several trains, tanks, and cars standing next to each other could pass through at once, and the weight of the gate was hard to calculate.</p><br><p>But, it was obvious that if the gate crashed to the ground, the rumble would be heard by everyone in the First Wing and it would take the help of many strong Phantoms and their abilities to lift at least one slab.</p><br><p>The walls, their peaks towering above the highest point of the gate, are structures mostly of stone, concrete, and steel.</p><br><p>Unlike the gate, the walls had no special function, as the farther away from the entrance the lower the walls became until they disappeared completely into the ground.</p><br><p>After all, the wings were not kingdoms that would separate themselves from each other with high walls, having spacious areas around them.</p><br><p>The wings were tightly enclosed like pieces of a pie cut into equal parts.</p><br><br><p>With a screech of tires from the sudden braking, the car's speed dropped to zero, finding itself in front of the gate.</p><br><p>At the gate stood several squads of military personnel, along with them were menacing combat vehicles and dozens of people guarding the main entrance.</p><br><p>"Hm... they don't look friendly at all. Are these military men subordinate to some organization in the ninth wing?" Adam asked, watching as one of the military approached them.</p><br><p>It was a stout, tall man, wearing a uniform of dark green and sand colors. Unlike the other military men he was not holding a weapon, he was on his way to see who wanted to enter the ninth wing at this hour.</p><br><p>Gladius heard Adam's question and shook his head.</p><br><p>"Nah, specifically these military are not someone's mercenaries as is often the case elsewhere in the ninth wing. They work under an arrangement between the forts and the Noukx Family. Well, they're still part of this curious place."</p><br><br><p>The man stopped beside the car, staring intently at the driver's seat, his face serious and menacing.</p><br><p>"Purpose of the visit? I won't let you inside unless you tell me everything properly about your intentions and what you are planning to do in the ninth wing." The man said in a low voice.</p><br><p>Everyone looked over.</p><br><p>The man saw who was sitting inside and most likely he recognized a few people, even though there were a few high nobles, it didn't confuse him in any way.</p><br><p>'Hm? Are we supposed to say something?' Adam asked with his gaze glancing back and forth at Osana and Franz.</p><br><p>Oddly enough neither of them gave him an answer, they didn't know any more than Adam did.</p><br><p>"Oh, you probably think we're strangers, but we have an invitation." Gladius smirked slyly before reaching into his pocket.</p><br><p>At the same moment, battle turrets, several rifles, and plasma cannons were aimed at their car, ready to fire on their commander's orders.</p><br><p>'Shit... They did it in an instant. Well, they don't know what Gladius is going to pull out of his pocket, but is there really a need for such measures?' Explore more at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Adam was taken aback, but he felt calm, unlike Nelya and Silvana who were mere humans.</p><br><p>The girls exchanged a glance and flinched, hoping that the situation wouldn't escalate beyond a warning.</p><br><p>"Hmm... I can't find it..." Gladius frowned before smiling foolishly and exclaiming, "Ah, right! It's in the other pocket!"</p><br><p>The military man raised an eyebrow, he was slightly surprised that someone was acting so calm and relaxed despite the overall tension of the situation and the oppressive atmosphere.</p><br><p>"Found it!" Gladius exclaimed before pulling from his pocket a round, black amulet made of durable material.</p><br><p>On the amulet was a series of gruesome symbols - eight blood-covered hands held together, creating a ring, inside was a wide-open eye with a red pupil.</p><br><p>It was the emblem of the Noukx Family, completely fitting their style, long history, and their current head.</p><br><br><p>Gladius swung the amulet, revealing two initials engraved on the back, though it looked more like someone took a few rough swipes with a dagger - K.N.</p><br><p>As soon as the man saw the emblem of the Noukx Family, his eyes went wide.</p><br><p>But... he didn't apologize or immediately become polite.</p><br><p>Instead, he took a wide step back and grinned widely.</p><br><p>"Hah, it's not often you see an amulet with the initials of the Noukx Family head himself. Come in. We welcome you to the ninth wing! In the worst place for the best and the best place for the worst!" The man exclaimed with a wave of his hand, laughing loudly.</p><br><p>With a wave of his hand, he gave the order to the remaining military personnel.</p><br><p>Then, the gate lock rotated, the pistons shuddered and the massive gate slowly came into motion.</p>
