            <h4>Chapter 1448: Work Together</h4><br><p>The Silver Weaver’s plan came as a surprise to Silvana, but since she had agreed, he immediately set to work.
</p><br><br><p>He touched Silvana’s forehead, putting her back to sleep. Until she woke up, she wouldn’t remember what had happened.
</p><br><p>Well, when she opened her eyes after a long time, she would have some other problems, but for now, it was necessary to get there.
</p><br><p>Adam’s inner space was a rather empty place.
</p><br><p>Sure, it contained all his power, the Evolution Tree was the core of his energy, but in the end, it was nothing more than endless darkness with a light in the middle.
</p><br><br><p>Some time after Silvana fell back asleep, footsteps sounded in the darkness.
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze left the Initial Gene as she found herself in bright light, inside the Evolution Tree.
</p><br><p>She raised her head, looking at the trembling current of white energy flowing to the very top of the Evolution Tree. Now, the current was quite thin, comparable to a tree trunk, but when Adam was at the peak of his power, it became a powerful river with overwhelming force.
</p><br><p>However, Lone Blaze did not come here to observe Adam’s energy; she had another goal.
</p><br><p>Soon, the light changed back to darkness as a figure appeared in the distance, standing in front of the Energy Axis.
</p><br><p>"So, she agreed?" Lone Blaze asked, stroking her forearm.
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver nodded.
</p><br><p>His arms were spread apart as two streams of energy from different sources were directed towards him. One belonged to Adam, and the other to Silvana.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, it was easy. I have a lot of work ahead of me, so if you have any questions, ask them quickly and don’t bother me anymore."
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze shook her head.
</p><br><p>"No, that’s not why I came here."
</p><br><p>"Hmm?" The Silver Weaver glanced at her.
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze placed her palm on her chest.
</p><br><p>"I want to help. My control over energy isn’t as high as yours, but I think I can lighten your load and speed up the process."
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver was skeptical, it was clear from his gaze. Although he was arrogant, he wasn’t stupid.
</p><br><p>"Alright, come here, I’ll try to explain it to you."
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze smiled happily as she practically ran to him.
</p><br><p>She was an artifact, but even at the time she met Adam, she was strong enough to have a mind and talk freely with him. Much time had passed since that day, and Adam had become much stronger, so this had affected Lone Blaze as well.
</p><br><p>Not only had her appearance and abilities changed, but her feelings and emotions had also become deeper, almost indistinguishable from those of a human.
</p><br><p>In fact, she was simply lonely, spending most of her time in her small space. She only acted when Adam was fighting someone or came to the inner space on some business.
</p><br><p>But... when the Silver Weaver appeared here, she realized that there was no longer any reason to remain alone.
</p><br><p>"Good." The Silver Weaver nodded deeply as he watched Lone Blaze direct energy from one stream to another. "Keep up the good work, maybe these two will recover even sooner than I expected."
</p><br><br><p>"Thanks... But, about Adam, do you know what’s in store for him next?"
</p><br><p>"Hmm?" The Silver Weaver turned toward the Path Construct. "Are you talking about that thing?"
</p><br><p>"Yes, he has already created two Grand Stars. The next one should be even more difficult, right? He absorbed the crystals of the stars, went through an important battle, even several dangerous duels, and you... You are also part of the Second Grand Star, aren’t you?"
</p><br><p>In response, the Silver Weaver shook his head.
</p><br><p>"I’m sorry, but even I don’t know anything about that. The Path Construct... It is alive, just like the Evolution Tree, or we are, however, it is also different. It is a mechanism that allows Adam to become stronger, go beyond his limits, and possibly reach the Second Circle.
</p><br><p>"Either way, we have no choice but to support him and Silvana. It depends on both of them how far Adam can go, as well as our evolution."
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze bit her lip as she nodded slightly.
</p><br><p>When the Path Construct first appeared in Adam’s inner space, she was wary. But now she understood that it was Adam’s only way to achieve what he wanted.
</p><br><p>"But..." Lone Blaze’s voice trembled. "We know what Adam wants to do, and we understand that the chances of failure are much higher than the chances of success. If he can’t stop the World Wipe, then... only darkness awaits us all."
</p><br><br><p>The Lone Blaze put his hand on her shoulder.
</p><br><p>"Don’t think about it and focus on your work. There are still six and a half years until the next World Wipe. Do you have any idea how much can change in that time?"
</p><br><p>After a few moments, Lone Blaze nodded as her gaze deepened.
</p><br><p>"In any case, we have no choice but to go with this fool until the very end, don’t we?"
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver grinned broadly. He liked that Lone Blaze finally understood who their boss was and who they worked for. Of course, it was all done with love, well... at least on her part.
</p><br><br><p>They knew a lot about the world and saw events through Adam. They understood that even if Adam reached the Second Rank, which was an extra-difficult task in itself, it offered no guarantees.
</p><br><p>Of course, with that level of power, Adam and Silvana could live for several thousand years. Their bodies would have enough energy to remain virtually ageless and invincible to most creatures in the world.
</p><br><p>Still, even the strongest warriors capable of fighting a monster like Damien had not been able to stop the World Wipe, yet.
</p><br><p>Each faction had its own opinion about the World Wipe and the First Star and Last Star. They had disagreements, and it was unknown whether they would have enough strength even if they united.
</p><br><p>But, for now, Adam and Silvana had to deal with one simple task: to wake up.</p>
