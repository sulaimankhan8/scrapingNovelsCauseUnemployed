            <br><br><p>Silence wandered along the Lands of the Lone Serpent. The battles between the monsters and the Phantoms continued, the Blind Sinner and the Dormant Lord kept up their pace, yet everyone had the feeling that something was wrong.</p><br><p>Everyone felt that there was no point in what they were doing, that their efforts could not affect the course of events, or their future unless something specific happened.</p><br><p>The phantoms and monsters were not stupid, they realized that it was all about the aura coming from the depths of the fortress, the crimson mist reached the surface gradually changing the battlefield, preparing it for a new player.</p><br><p>Viron glanced at Katirn, his arm and internal wounds were almost healed, Gnash was in a similar situation, their supports did an excellent job.</p><br><p>"What do we do? Maybe try to find a way down? Looks like our Unknown Phantom is in trouble. I don't know what's going on down there, but I have a bad feeling about it."</p><br><p>Gnash glanced toward the gate, looking at the active monsters, flames burning brightly in their eyes and smirks resting on their faces.</p><br><p>"Too bad... The monsters' instincts are much sharper than ours. If they feel that the situation changed for the better for them, then that's the case. The problem is, we don't know exactly what's going on."</p><br><p>Directing her gaze upward, Katrin stared at Eclipse for a while before clenching her fists tightly.</p><br><p>"There's no point in going to the depths of the fortress, we'll lose valuable fighters that can defend the walls and kill monsters."</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, Katrin continued:</p><br><p>"That Unknown Phantom decided to pursue his mission and not help us, there's no point in trying to rescue him. No one knows what is in the depths of the fortress, death traps, and monsters, anything is possible. We should stick to Viron's plan and kill the Dormant Lord after their fight is over."</p><br><p>There were no more than ten Phantoms beside Katrin besides Viron and Gnash, but thanks to the Operators her voice was heard by everyone inside the fortress and fighting on the bridge.</p><br><p>In difficult situations, it wasn't good news - it was having a plan - that kept morale high. If everyone knew what to do and what goal lay before them, their actions, pains, and battles had meaning.</p><br><p>Viron nodded deeply as he slowly rose from the ground:</p><br><p>"Good, then that's what we'll do. Let's see what happens next."</p><br><br><p>A silver needle, in a fiery flash, swept through the streams of wind. The stone layer hadn't completely come off Adam's body yet, but he was already attacking.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch took a step back, guiding his hand towards his chest.</p><br><p>At the last moment when the sharp tip was about to pierce the Crimson Monarch's heart, a dense layer of color-rich blood emerged in front of his palm.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Shockwaves in air rings spread apart from the point of thrust.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch managed to defend himself, but it had no effect on Adam's confidence in his actions, his eyes full of determination.</p><br><p>"The Monarch of Crimson Thunder... What an impressive title."</p><br><p>Adam uttered in a deep voice, taking one step forward, a fiery blast rained down on the Crimson Monarch but failed to even heat his pale skin.</p><br><p>The purple snake settled on his shoulder hissed, opening its jaw wide, four sharp fangs should have scared Adam, but he didn't even glance in its direction. The snake tried to turn Adam into stone again, but it was no longer possible.</p><br><p>His energy was enough to have faced the threat of petrification once to know how to block it. More often than not, such attacks were one-time trump cards, and if they failed, they lost their effectiveness.</p><br><br><p>Adam took another step, not giving up trying to pierce the bloody layer and palm of his enemy's hand.</p><br><p>"Hey, I have one question for you."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch narrowed his eyes. He couldn't remember the last time he faced an opponent willing to hold a conversation after escaping the death grip seconds ago.</p><br><p>"What? With all due respect... it gets bigger as time goes on. The battle is not a good time to talk."</p><br><p>"Oh, don't worry. I won't take up much of your time. Just one, simple question."</p><br><p>The scalding flames grew brighter, casting light on their faces.</p><br><p>"Like you said, I'm human. I have a name, but no title. Me and monsters have the opposite situation. So... If you had the chance, what title would you give me? I'm curious."</p><br><p>Before the Crimson Monarch could say anything, Adam's frame shuddered as he found himself to the right of the monster.</p><br><br><p>The sharp edge of the needle left a wide cut on the Crimson Monarch's chest, running from his waist to his left shoulder.</p><br><p>Ignoring the pain, the Crimson Monarch tactfully jumped back, the days when such a wound could throw off his focus were long gone.</p><br><p>Adam turned his head in his direction, seeing that the cut on the Crimson Monarch's chest was already a third healed.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch stared intently at Adam for a while, deciding to answer his question, one last time:</p><br><p>"I'm afraid I'm not in a position to decide that. I am not one to assign titles to other creatures. Obviously, my title wasn't chosen by me as well."</p><br><p>Adam got to his feet confidently, his needle pointed towards the ground.</p><br><p>"In that case, who is doing this? What were those runes and stellar mist... I want to know."</p><br><p>"Only one question and I've already given you the answer. You are too young and weak to know more about the world you live in, about the Last Star... You were born at a bad time, you will not live a long life."</p><br><p>If this were a different situation Adam would take the Crimson Monarch's words as a threat, that he would kill him quickly and therefore not live long, but... Adam felt that the Crimson Monarch was speaking in general.</p><br><br><p>"I have heard this many times, yet I continue to move forward. You will not be the one to stop me, I will learn the truth about my world."</p><br><p>In a strange way, the Crimson Monarch's corners of his lips went up, forming a bitter smile, the first clear emotion.</p><br><p>"I'm afraid you won't like it. No one enjoys the truth."</p>
