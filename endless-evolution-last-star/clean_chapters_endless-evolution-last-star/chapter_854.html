            <br><p>Adam's quiet words were compared to the deafening thunder that ran through the spacious passageway.</p><br><p>At the last moment, Spiro stopped, a fraction of a second more, and his palm would have pierced Adam's neck, but... their fight was over. That much was clear.</p><br><br><p>The girl, observer No. 6, clapped her hands together, keeping a slight, unaffected-by-the-events smile.</p><br><p>With a sharp wave of her hand, she announced:</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter has surrendered. The fight is over, the winner is Spiro Lorenzo!"</p><br><p>Without further ado, Adam nodded deeply and walked past the girl heading straight for the salon. In complete silence, he met Silvana's eyes, yet now he had not come to appreciate her new style.</p><br><p>He held out his hand, and she immediately understood him, handing over three Twilight Coins.</p><br><br><p>Adam walked over to the girl and showed her one coin, holding it firmly with two fingers.</p><br><p>"This. I have to give one coin to you, right?"</p><br><p>The girl smiled slyly, confirming with a slight nod:</p><br><p>"Sure, you lost in the end, which means Spiro should get your coin as a reward. You now have two coins."</p><br><p>With a nonchalant look, Adam shrugged and tossed her the coin. She deftly caught the twilight coin, clutching it in her fist.</p><br><p>Adam was about to leave, but by then Spiro had finally come to his senses:</p><br><p>"Wait! What the fuck was that?! Why did you give up without even trying to fight me?"</p><br><p>So far Spiro wasn't feeling angry, he was confused. His attack was good, he was sure of it, but despite Adam's defeat, he didn't feel victorious. Anxiety was slowly growing deep inside him.</p><br><p>Not willing to ignore it, Adam cast a glance over his shoulder.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Didn't you say you would defeat me quickly? I saw how strong you were and realized I didn't stand a chance, so I decided to give up to avoid being beaten."</p><br><p>Not wanting to talk anymore, Adam waved his hand like he was trying to get rid of a pesky fly.</p><br><p>"Now you have three coins. Good luck, two more wins, and you can prove to everyone how special you are."</p><br><p>Spiro's arrogance and confidence in his abilities as a nobleman from the fourth great family, the Lorenzo Family, was so high that it was only when Adam and Silvana disappeared into the clothing store he began to suspect something.</p><br><p>With a shiver running through his body, Spiro muttered:</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter... That commoner, did he give up on purpose?"</p><br><p>Anger filled his gaze, with tightly clenched fists he headed toward Misa's place.</p><br><br><p>No sooner did he take a few steps than his chest crashed into the girl's arm, the observer. He jerked his head to meet her slightly frightening gaze.</p><br><p>"Spiro Lorenzo, your fight was completed by your victory. I'm afraid you are no longer eligible to fight against Mr. Adam."</p><br><p>With a wide stride forward, Spiro firmly grabbed the girl by the collar lifting her above the ground effortlessly. For him, a K3-Phantom, it was easy.</p><br><p>"You... There was something wrong here from the start. Why are you treating this commoner with such respect?"</p><br><p>Spiro's facial muscles twitched and his veins inflated. He was outraged to the core. He expected to get an easy victory, in a real fight, not some joke in which he was left as a fool!</p><br><p>Moreover, his pride as a nobleman could not ignore how the observer addressed Adam but not him!</p><br><p>Even though Spiro could kill the girl in a single sweep of his hand, not a hint of fear showed in her gaze.</p><br><p>"Spiro Lorenzo..." she wheezed in a menacing tone, "I suggest you let me go or I'll have to tell Mr. Andreas everything. I'm sure you don't want trouble with a man like that."</p><br><p>With a contorted face, Spiro loosened his grip and roughly took the twilight coin from her open palm.</p><br><p>He had no other choice. The fight was legitimate and he didn't need the trouble and reputational loss of a reprimand from Andreas.</p><br><p>Lastly, the girl bowed low without raising her head.</p><br><p>"I, as observer No. 6, congratulate you on your victory. I hope you can reach the Twilight Gates soon and leave this place as your family's hope."</p><br><p>There was no response, Spiro only gritted his teeth not wanting to hear a word more. This wasn't just the worst fight in his history, this was a true disgrace to him!</p><br><p>And... soon Adam would realize that his decision to surrender in the beginning was not without flaws.</p><br><br><p>In the meantime, Adam was patiently waiting for Misa to finish choosing Silvana's outfit. They were doing it in a closed part of the store so that Adam wouldn't see anything beforehand.</p><br><p>He looked at the two twilight coins, his calm expression reflected in the black crystals.</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Adam mused, "That was easy. Andreas scared me with his speeches, but it looks like getting out of the Twilight Palace won't be as hard as I thought."</p><br><p>Then, he looked at his NEP, studying the map from time to time, he had to know this place at least partially.</p><br><p>"This hotel, or rather battlefield... it's huge. All I need is to find two more idiots wanting sure wins and that's it."</p><br><p>A few minutes later, Misa appeared in Adam's field of vision, catching his attention.</p><br><p>"You're not bored here?" Misa asked with a slight smile before standing aside and waving, "Come on Silvana, get in!"</p><br><p>Adam realized what was about to happen, so he focused on one point.</p><br><br><p>In confident steps, with the echo of heels hitting the marble floor, Silvana unveiled herself, causing Adam's eyes to go wide in a daze.</p><br><p>Taking Misa's advice, she adopted a serious stance allowing Adam to get a proper look at herself.</p><br><p>When they first met, Silvana had only worn strict formal clothes, she had returned to that style but making it a little looser.</p><br><p>The long-sleeved black jacket was no longer closed and didn't squeeze her fragile frame, the edges were quite short revealing a view of the tight white shirt underneath that was closed with large dark buttons.</p><br><p>A narrow pencil skirt above her knees hugged her thighs passing over almost invisible stockings ending in high heels.</p><br><p>But, her clothes didn't impress Adam as much as her hair. Goran did his job admirably.</p><br><p>Her black hair reaching down to her chin was styled in a serious manner, much like an office look, but with adjustments to emphasize Silvana's sharp facial features and her deep green eyes.</p><br><p>Misa leaned over admiring Adam's reaction.</p><br><p>"Hah, what do you think? I think it turned out great."</p><br>
