            <br><br><p>Adam and Leona stood in front of the self-service checkout counter, swiping the groceries in front of the scanner. If the product didn't have a barcode, the built-in AI did all the work, determining the weight of the food and calculating its value.</p><br><p>Together, they looked like two experienced factory workers. Leona quickly passed the products in front of the scanner before tossing them to Adam, who in turn, deftly placed them in bags like pieces in a construction kit.</p><br><p>This went on for a while and began to attract the attention of other visitors and working staff who watched their actions with curiosity and the amount of food they were picking up.</p><br><p>This led some people, especially among the younger generation, to turn their attention to Adam.</p><br><p>Sure, they didn't see his NEP, but Adam didn't use disguises like Damien did when he went out, with his level of popularity it just wasn't necessary, was it?</p><br><p>Well, someone still managed to recognize him. They didn't approach since he wasn't alone and looked rather focused, which was a bit intimidating, but their gazes were fixed on him like a magnet.</p><br><p>"Wow... Looks like my son has gotten a lot more popular lately, isn't it?" Leona said in surprise, glancing around. It did nothing to stop her from continuing to move her hands and scan the groceries.</p><br><p>Adam shrugged, he seemed to be used to the occasional glances in his direction wherever he was.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you're probably right, but I can't say I've ever aspired to that. I'd call it a side effect of Phantom work. If you successfully complete missions and survive, eventually people start to recognize you." Adam quickly explained before throwing the jar of salted caramel into the bag, it was the last one.</p><br><p>Then, Adam waved his hand, indicating for the drones to follow them and carry their purchases. Sure, Adam was strong enough to lift several hundred times the weight without any effort, but it would be too uncomfortable.</p><br><p>Leona nodded and followed Adam, casting one last glance at the screen where the sum that Adam had just paid.</p><br><p>'1,273 credits... Fuck, that's a bit more than we pay for the rent on our house. And, Adam paid without even raising an eyebrow. Although, considering how much money he spent on gifts it's not surprising, but... it's still a bit unusual.'</p><br><p>Leona internally muttered before turning around and looking at Adam's back.</p><br><p>'It's definitely a good thing that Adam became a Phantom. This job suits him, but... will the day come when I regret that my son got superpowers?' Leona's gaze grew deeper and darker.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, she noticed at the bottom of the bags some cupcakes that they took under Leona's suggestion.</p><br><p>'Hah, no need to think about that right now. After all, we have a family dinner and dessert waiting for us!'</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Glara was pondering as well, but she wasn't concerned about the food or dessert, but the eerie sight of a second monster floating in front of her in the form of a hologram.</p><br><p>The monster's body was long, skinny, and curvy, like something between a snake and a lizard, but the similarities were only in the body structure.</p><br><p>The monster had no scales or smooth protective plates, as its entire body was covered with dry thorns as if from tortured branches, the thorns intertwined with each other, forming a strong and impregnable armor, hiding only darkness behind it.</p><br><p>The monster's weapons were short, curved claws in the shape of crooked tree branches. Amidst the darkness hiding behind the spikes, two red eyes could be seen near the head.</p><br><p>"It's Shadow of the Woods. It looks threatening, I understand, but in reality, other than speed and dangerous appearance, this monster has nothing to boast about. After all, it's only a White Threat Level, just a lesser creature." Aiden waved his hand carelessly.</p><br><p>His voice was full of arrogance and strength.</p><br><p>"Moreover, of the three of them, Shadow of the Woods has the weakest defense. Its spikes are filled with energy, but they're not strong enough to protect it from a powerful attack."</p><br><p>Glara gulped, despite Aiden's words she didn't want to face such an opponent at all. She could see how Shadow's claws were tearing her flesh apart and its spikes were digging into her body.</p><br><p>"W-Well... Even if you say so, I'm not sure about it. Shadow... looks creepy. Moreover, I don't see how I can defeat it with my weapon set. My shield will be useless against the hundreds of spikes that surround me on all sides."</p><br><p>Aiden nodded and swung his hand slightly, directing Glara's gaze to the third and final monster.</p><br><p>Hearing Glara's response, Gladius grinned widely. No one saw this as he stood in the corner of the room, completely hidden by the shadows.</p><br><p>His reaction was caused because he knew that Shadow of the Woods was a trap from Aiden. If Glara hadn't realized that she didn't stand a chance against this monster because of her chosen weapon, Aiden would have considered her a failure and sent her to training without letting her prove herself.</p><br><p>Sure, in that case, he would probably lose a rare opportunity, but a living Glara was more useful than a dead one.</p><br><p>Could he have given her a clue? Yes, but to survive she needed good instincts and intuition, not hints from the stronger ones.</p><br><p>Glara nodded and looked away.</p><br><p>The third monster didn't look as bland as Gray Choro and not as intimidating as Shadow of the Woods. It was a black wolf with notable red hoops of energy on its paws and neck. It had two pointed ears, an elongated maw, and two eyes with vertical pupils.</p><br><p>It seemed that if it weren't for the hoops of energy it would be no different from ordinary wolves, but... there was one detail that made a significant contrast between them.</p><br><p>A massive round crystal, like a core, was in the monster's chest, filling its entire body with energy. It was a special feature of this monster and had nothing to do with Essence Type who might have something similar in the first time after absorbing the artifact.</p><br><p>Glara's eyes went wide, looking at the wolf's red claws and its long dirty tail, stiff and not fluffy at all.</p><br><p>"This is Redcore Wolf, he looks ordinary, I realize, but I'd say among the three of them he's the strongest. The difference in strength isn't critical, only a few percent, but it's a fact. His defense, speed, and attack aren't anything special, but all of those stats are above average which makes him a great fighter."</p><br><p>Aiden continued, pointing at the red crystal in the monster's chest.</p><br><p>"This crystal is his main strength and greatest weakness."</p><br><p>Then, Aiden waved his hand, turning sideways in his chair.</p><br><p>"I give you five minutes to make a decision."</p><br><p>Glara didn't answer anything, she only stared curiously at the Redcore Wolf. She already knew that Phantom gained abilities from the first monster it killed.</p><br><p>And... she saw how she could defeat Redcore Wolf and survive. How she could continue her brother's legacy.</p><br><p>"Don't. Five minutes is too long. I've already made my decision." Glara said confidently while pointing at Redcore Wolf.</p>
