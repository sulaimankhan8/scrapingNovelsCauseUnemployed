            <br><p>Glara awaited a long journey under the patronage of Aiden Henk, one of the free scientists.</p><br><p>Perhaps she would quickly reach the level of her brother or Adam, or perhaps she would die on her first missions, though... it was unlikely Aiden would allow such a thing after Glara had become his subordinate.</p><br><p>On this day, as on all others, many events of varying degrees of importance occurred.</p><br><p>Night had begun, covering the sky with a multitude of stars only to soon give way to the sun slowly rising from the horizon line.</p><br><p>Adam slowly opened his eyes, looking around and realizing that he was on the couch, in the hall in Silvana's apartment.</p><br><p>Silvana was still asleep, she usually got up much earlier than Adam to plan their day and deal with organizational issues if there were any.</p><br><p>But, since they were both on vacation, today she decided not to set her alarm and sleep as long as her body wanted.</p><br><p>"Hah, maybe we should switch places for at least one morning?"</p><br><p>Adam muttered as his stomach rumbled.</p><br><p>"What's more, despite everything we ate yesterday, I'm hungry again. Damn, that's weird how this works."</p><br><p>Adam frowned slightly before getting off the couch and heading for the kitchen.</p><br><p>On the way, he grumbled like some old man:</p><br><p>"You can eat all day long, something fatty and high in calories, but the next day you're hungry again!"</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Although, it's worth admitting that it works the other way too. Even if you haven't eaten anything for a week, one hearty meal is enough. You don't need to eat ten kilos of food to fill your hunger for a whole week."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged, pulling out a bag of coffee. It was the second most expensive and rare coffee Adam had bought for Silvana.</p><br><p>They only had time to try one yesterday, so Adam decided not to waste this opportunity and try something else. He hoped this coffee was worth the money he spent on it.</p><br><p>Twenty minutes later, Silvana opened her eyes, the aroma of coffee coming from the kitchen playing a big part in her awakening.</p><br><p>Silvana yawned, stretched her arms out to her sides, and rubbing her eyes headed for the kitchen.</p><br><p>"Good morning or is it already good afternoon?" Silvana said with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>She looked at Adam as her eyes went wide for a moment. He not only made coffee but also prepared some sandwiches for them, there were a few chocolate candies for dessert as an addition to the coffee.</p><br><p>"Wow, if this keeps up I might get lazy. I'd be more careful if I were you." Silvana smiled before taking the sandwich and taking the first bite.</p><br><p>Adam shrugged throwing her a look full of curiosity.</p><br><p>"Toasted toast, tomato rings, cheese slices, greens and ham. What do you think?" Adam asked, explaining what was inside the sandwich.</p><br><br><p>"It's not bad, but I'd add a little more vegetables." Silvana looked at the sandwich where the meat, sauce, and cheese were five or even six times more than everything else.</p><br><p>Adam spread his hands apart.</p><br><p>"That's the way I cook. This morning I was the cook so I accept no complaints, only praise or constructive criticism."</p><br><br><p>"Hah, you'd be a bad cook. What about the coffee? Is it all ready yet?" Silvana asked looking at the two cups.</p><br><p>For himself Adam made a latte, he wasn't braced for another hit of strength and bitterness, but for Silvana, he made espresso since he realized that for her it was the best option.</p><br><p>Silvana took the first sip, under Adam's watchful gaze. He hoped this coffee was as good as the last one.</p><br><p>"Not bad, not bad at all." Enjoy new stories from empire</p><br><p>Then, Silvana cast a glance at Adam.</p><br><p>"So...? Have you decided how long we're going to rest?"</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, I think a couple of days will be enough time for us to get back to normal and ready for new plans. By the way, before I go, I wanted to ask for your help."</p><br><p>Silvana raised an eyebrow, she was slightly confused.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Sure, I'll do what I can. Does this have something to do with the Dead Lands?" Silvana suggested.</p><br><p>Adam shook his head, scratching the back of his head.</p><br><p>"Nah, actually you need to talk to my mom. I just want to buy a new house, in the Second Ring." Adam explained.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide. She clearly hadn't expected Adam to decide to arrange his move so soon, considering that his family had lived in this house for only a couple of months. Adam, himself, had been in his house just a few times, and he was already eager to move to a new place.</p><br><p>"Oh, right, after the last mission, fulfilling Katrin's request, you made quite a bit of money, didn't you?" Silvana said, remembering what roughly the housing prices were in the Second Ring.</p><br><p>Sure, the Second Ring was a large area, but the prices weren't random, so Silvana realized that with Adam's capabilities, it wasn't a problem to buy a decent house for him and his family.</p><br><p>"Yeah, I'm not sure how much money I want to spend, but I'm thinking 400 to 700 thousand credits. Do you think within that amount, you'll find something suitable?" Adam asked uncertainly.</p><br><p>The options he had seen with Leona weren't bad, but nothing was outstanding.</p><br><p>"Hah, don't worry. In a few days be ready to make payment, I'll make everything in the best way." Silvana replied, a kind smile on her face.</p><br><p>Adam nodded before walking over to Silvana and hugging her tightly.</p><br><p>Silvana was shocked at this turn of events, Adam had never done anything like this before but... she had no desire to get out of his embrace at all.</p><br><p>"Thank you, without you, I would have a hard time settling into a new world for me."</p><br><p>Silvana with flushed cheeks, hesitantly said: "S-Sure... It's my job as your Operator. You can always rely on me."</p><br><br><br><p>An hour later, Adam left Silvana's apartment with the simple purpose of walking around the city.</p><br><br><p>But... no sooner had he walked a hundred meters than a message arrived on his phone.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Silvana forget something? But, why on the phone?" Adam was stumped, pulling his phone out of his pocket.</p><br><p>His eyes went wide as it wasn't Silvana who texted him.</p><br><p>"Hey. Let's meet this evening. That's my first wish."</p><br><p>Osana decided it was time to contact Adam.</p>
