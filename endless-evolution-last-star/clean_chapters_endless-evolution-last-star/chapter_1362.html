            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1362: Future of the Past</strong></p><br><p>Every Phantom had a set of abilities from the moment they embarked on this path. If they managed to survive long enough and pass several stages, they became strong enough for their Operator to gain abilities as well.</p><br><p>Over time, every Phantom and Operator would go through these stages if they reached a high enough level of power.</p><br><p>Obviously, the Evolution Vein was the key point. That was when the Phantom and Operator gained the power they had to use together. It was the first step toward true power that was only available to Second Rank Phantoms.</p><br><p>Adam still had a way to go to reach that level, but he was steadily approaching that peak, which was much more difficult to achieve and more significant for a Phantom than for monsters.</p><br><p>The Imaginary Cut became Adam’s strongest weapon for a long time, but one ability was not all that the Evolution Vein was capable of.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Evolution Vein actively trembled as it continued its growth along the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>[Good… This should have happened a long time ago… I hope Adam appreciates this power… because without Silvana’s efforts, none of this would have been possible…]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree did not resist, on the contrary, it directed its energy to help the Evolution Vein reach its new form as quickly as possible, and Lone Blaze, using the little power she had available, did the same.</p><br><p>“This ability…” Lone Blaze’s voice trembled. “This isn’t the limit of what they’re capable of together, right?”</p><br><p>[Of course not. Second Rank Phantoms… They are capable of many things… more than Adam can imagine, but not only because of their incredible power in solo… but because of their combined efforts… abilities such as the Imaginary Cut and this one…]</p><br><br><p>Cutting through the wind, the white spear headed towards the pile of wyverns.</p><br><p>The wyverns flinched as their eyes widened. In terror, they scattered in different directions in an attempt to dodge the attack, but not all of them were so lucky.</p><br><p>Thrust. Thrust. Thrust.</p><br><p>The white spear pierced the neck of one wyvern, then the chest of the second, and the torso of the third, constantly gaining speed and increasing in size. The previously small spear that fit in Adam’s hand was now long enough to be thrown by a giant, enough to make the massive wyverns look like small birds in comparison.</p><br><p>In the end, the white spear pierced several ice peaks before stopping with a bright flash that momentarily covered the entire area of the third trial.</p><br><p>Rumble. Rumble. Rumble.</p><br><p>With a deafening roar, an explosion of white flame destroyed everything within a ten-meter radius of the epicenter.</p><br><p>Nothing remained of the three wyverns except for a few broken claws and scales scattered about.</p><br><p>Gusts of wind reached Adam, who hovered high above the ground, looking at the aftermath of a single spear throw, a single attack of his new ability.</p><br><br><p>A power that originated long ago, but only now has reached the point where the past changes the present and influences the future. This power is sourced from the deep connection between two partners and their past that has become the future.]</p><br><p>At the same moment, white gloves appeared on Adam’s hands, slightly different from those Silvana used when working on the Energy Axis. On his fingertips and palms were black plates for extra grip strength.</p><br><p>Adam clenched his fists several times and nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“Future of the Past? Hah, I don’t know about the past, but this power will definitely help me achieve the future.”</p><br><br><p>At the same time, at the very top of the tower, Bertrada was going through a difficult time.</p><br><p>When the wyverns were ready to reach Adam and tear him to pieces, her eyes shone as brightly as the stars. She was sure that it would all be over soon, but now… now everything had changed.</p><br><p>“What the hell was that?! What kind of ability is that? Did he have something like that before?!” Bertrada exclaimed, staring at Adam, who was floating serenely with his wings spread wide.</p><br><p>“Grrrrh!” She growled, gritting her teeth as her eyes filled with blood. “How he irritates me. Why can’t he just lose?”</p><br><p>After a few moments, her expression froze as she realized something.</p><br><p>“R-Right… Such a powerful attack. That must have been his trump card! Mona, what do you think?” Bertrada turned to her.</p><br><p>Mona, who was standing to the side, nodded calmly.</p><br><p>“I think you’re right, ma’am.”</p><br><p>Bertrada smiled smugly. “Fine, he may have destroyed a few wyverns, but he wasted his trump card on just three weak monsters! That was his biggest mistake!”</p><br><p>Mona looked away from Bertrada to the mirror as she frowned.</p><br><p>‘I hate to admit it, but she’s right. It seems like Adam just got this power and hasn’t had time to adapt. Tsk, he should have thrown that spear at the Azure Wyvern, not these weaklings!’</p><br><br><br><p>With a crunch, the Azure Wyvern turned its head, looking at Adam with curiosity and caution.</p><br><p>After a few moments, the monster was convinced that Adam was no longer a threat and grinned widely.</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam looked at the bloodstains covering the ice peaks.</p><br><p>“I see. A powerful, destructive force. It’s very different from the Imaginary Cut, but that’s even better.”</p><br><p>The many wyverns, Bertrada, Mona, and his main opponent, the Azure Wyvern, watched Adam intently, waiting for his next move.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam just waved his hand.</p><br><br><p>With a slight tremor, another white spear appeared in his grip. It was no different from the last one and possessed the same terrifying power.</p><br><p>“Gha…?” The Azure Wyvern’s jaw dropped in disbelief.</p><br><p>And the guard wasn’t the only one with that reaction.</p><br><p>“W-What?!” Bertrada screamed at the top of her lungs. “He created it so easily? Isn’t that supposed to be his trump card!?”</p><br><p>While Bertrada panicked, Mona’s calm expression turned into a barely noticeable smirk.</p><br><p>‘Oh, it seems I underestimated him. But still… To create such a powerful weapon with a wave of his hand? How much energy does this young man have? It’s starting to scare even me.’</p><br><p>Adam looked at the trembling spear in his hand and nodded weakly before his frame turned into a blurry spot.</p><br><p>At tremendous speed, the white spear headed straight for the red heart, and only the Azure Wyvern could protect it.</p><br><p>There was a price to pay for this.</p>
