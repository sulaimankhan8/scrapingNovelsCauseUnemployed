            <h4>Chapter 1154: Sniper</h4><br><p>A woman with long blue hair down to her waist lay in hot water in a small, open pool. Through the streams of steam, nothing could be seen except the pale blue sky far above the clouds.
</p><br><p>In fact, this small island with only a few buildings hovered above Heaven Island, hidden even from the eyes of those who were allowed to enter the queen’s lands.
</p><br><p>This island was artificial, filled with engines and technology, and consisted of a metal frame with a thin layer of soil on top.
</p><br><p>There were no military buildings, warehouses, or anything of the sort on the island, but there were several cabins with terminals that constantly received data from all satellites, the military, and Operators who might need help.
</p><br><p>It was an Azure Island, and it was called that for one reason only: it belonged to Frida, the chief Phantom in the Azure Lotus, one of the three main factions in the entire Citadel.
</p><br><p>While Damien was the strongest Phantom in the Dark Order, Frida was the strongest in the Azure Lotus. Sure, Damien was the strongest overall, but that didn’t affect Frida’s position and her crucial importance to the entire Citadel.
</p><br><p>What was Frida’s job?
</p><br><p>She helped those who could be helped, saving dozens or even hundreds of lives every day.
</p><br><p>The main condition was that the target had to be on the surface or not too deep underground.
</p><br><p>Sure, Frida couldn’t help everyone, and sometimes it was simply impossible if the monsters were too close to the Phantoms.
</p><br><p>With a frown, Frida clutched the phone in her hand and slowly got out of the pool. She threw on a blue robe and left the building as the cold wind hit her.
</p><br><p>It was pretty cold at that height, and it often snowed here, even though it was just raining on the Citadel, but that wasn’t a problem for Frida.
</p><br><p>She had long forgotten the feeling of being too cold or too hot.
</p><br><p>"Agh, damn Damien! How he annoys me! He’s lived for hundreds of years, but he’s still such a child!"
</p><br><p>Frida complained with an angry face as she headed toward the western part of the island.
</p><br><p>"Frida, help me, Frida, do it, Frida, save him, save her, Frida, what’s your favorite ice cream flavor, Frida, what did you have for breakfast. Damn it! Why can’t he just leave me alone and send official requests if he needs my help like everyone else does!"
</p><br><p>Frida was one of the people Damien talked to the most. She would give anything for Damien to leave her alone for at least a week, even if it was just once in a hundred years!
</p><br><p>’Well, you could just delete his number.’
</p><br><p>A male voice rang out in her head, one that was well accustomed to how Frida reacted to Damien.
</p><br><p>"Tsk, and how many seconds would it take for him to come here and demand that everything be returned to the way it was? Not even a minute! I’ve tried to do that many times, and everything always went back to the way it was!"
</p><br><p>’Hah, it’s Damien, I’m afraid even death won’t change him. If he’s made up his mind, nothing and no one can stop him.’
</p><br><p>Frida rolled her eyes as her energy began to move, causing the entire island to tremble.
</p><br><p>"That’s not the point. I don’t mind saving Phantom, it’s my job after all. Even though Adam Vinter is just like Damien... Hell, he’s a young and very weak copy of him, but they have a lot in common, too much!"
</p><br><p>In response, a calm reply came.
</p><br><p>’I sent you the coordinates. You need to attack that place.’
</p><br><p>A second later, Frida nodded as she raised her hand.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Blue streams of energy turned into a huge spear that even a giant the size of a mountain would hardly be able to lift.
</p><br><p>In fact, the spear was bigger than the Azure Island.
</p><br><p>Then, Frida nodded weakly.
</p><br><p>"Sure, it could be dangerous. Most likely, he could be wiped out by the shock wave."
</p><br><p>With a blue glow, the spear changed shape and became several times smaller, slightly longer, and with a sharp tip.
</p><br><br><p>Her Operator smiled faintly.
</p><br><p>’You can start. This will be the second time you’ve saved this guy, right?’
</p><br><br><p>"Unfortunately, yes. I save dozens of Phantoms every day, and I’ve saved thousands since that day, but... I still remember that day for some reason."
</p><br><p>’Well, even though you don’t want to admit it too often, you are one of the strongest beings in this world. It’s no surprise that you noticed something special about Adam Vinter.’
</p><br><p>Frida shook her head.
</p><br><p>"It’s not just that. It’s not hard to see talent in a Phantom, especially for people like me, that’s true. But... the fact that he’s still alive considering how he got to where he is now, it’s not just a miracle, it’s a threat to all monsters, and soon more and more of them will realize that."
</p><br><p>’Sure, now is the most difficult stage of his life. Now that he has discovered the Patch Construct and has the energy of two star crystals within him... To any monster, he is like a royal feast.’
</p><br><p>"That’s why he should thank me, return to the Citadel, and fall to his knees!"
</p><br><p>Frida exclaimed as her fingers trembled.
</p><br><p>"But, I’m sure nothing will come of it. Not because he’s ungrateful, but because all he’ll be thinking about is getting back to the battlefield as soon as possible! Fuck! Maybe he’s Damien’s son? That bastard’s been around for hundreds of years! He could have found the time."
</p><br><p>’Hahaha, you’re obsessed with Damien. He’s not his son, but the same scum from the slums that Damien was. Well, in those days, almost everything was slums. Anyway, you know what I mean. It’s time to act.’
</p><br><p>Frida nodded as she waved her hand.
</p><br><p>This simple action caused the spear to move. The great frame blurred as a bright flash reached the speed of light, and the spear was thousands of kilometers away.
</p><br><p>Then, Frida turned around and returned to the small house in the center of the island, waiting for someone else to need her help.</p>
