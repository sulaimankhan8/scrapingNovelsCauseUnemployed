            <br><p>There were far fewer men at their party than women - on the male side there were only Adam, Edir, Tron, Louis, and Kody.</p><br><p>Well, that wasn't surprising since Kayla, Zera, Katrin, and Crita had come without their Operators, in which case there could have been even more men.</p><br><p>Edir, Louis, and Kody were already dancing, enjoying the process like Louis or their partners like Edir and Kody. </p><br><p>Katrin looked the most unhappy of them all, but she was also doing her best to keep up with Kody, who was dancing a little better than she was.</p><br><p>"I'm a little late, but it looks like, I've come to the most interesting part, don't you think?" Tron asked, looking at the three dancing duos.</p><br><p>"Yeah, something like that. I didn't even realize dancing could be so beautiful and calming..." Adam muttered with a thoughtful look.</p><br><br><p>"Not counting me, you're the only man left, who doesn't dance yet. Would you like to try?" Tron asked, a slight interest felt in his voice.</p><br><p>Adam glanced to the side, at Silvana, who was talking to Jena about something. They both looked great, each was good at something different, and their personalities were reflected in their appearance.</p><br><p>Tron seemed to realize something from Adam's puzzled stare, so he turned to Riska and said:</p><br><p>"Get us some champagne. Then, we'll go dancing." Tron said calmly.</p><br><p>Riska only smiled slightly and nodded, walking away. She realized she wasn't supposed to be here right now.</p><br><p>"Are you in a relationship with this girl?" Tron asked, glancing at Jena.</p><br><p>"Kind of... Honestly, it's all pretty confusing and weird. I'm constantly either fighting or escaping prisons or spending days in a dormant state trying to recover from a hard fight. Though... It's all just excuses." Adam sighed heavily with a sad look.</p><br><p>Tron was silent, he was listening to him intently.</p><br><p>"I'm not sure I want a relationship. And... it's not about Jena at all, she's a great doctor, and I don't mind being with a regular person." Adam scratched his cheek in a baffled manner.</p><br><p>Tron nodded understandingly.</p><br><p>"After my question about the dance, you're thinking about who to pick, right? If you go with Silvana, you'll offend Jena that way, and if you go with Jena, you'll leave Silvana out, and you definitely don't want that."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, it was as if Tron had read his mind. Nothing was surprising here though, anyone could figure it out.</p><br><p>Tron continued, "Adam, you have to understand something, things are a little different with Phantoms. For the average person, the most important person is usually a wife or husband. After all, it's the person you're creating a new family and future with."</p><br><p>Tron glanced at Riska, who was already walking towards them with two glasses of champagne.</p><br><p>"However, for Phantom, this is Operator. Sure, you and Silvana won't be lovers as well as me and Riska, because sex and feelings aren't the most important thing a Phantom can build a relationship on."</p><br><p>Adam looked at him puzzled, as if Tron's words could dispel his doubts. He constantly felt he was missing something in his understanding of relationships.</p><br><p>'If it's sex and feelings for normal humans, then what is it for Phantoms? What could be more important than sincere feelings filled with love...?' Adam muttered inwardly, trying to find an answer to this mystery.</p><br><p>"With lovers, it's sex and feelings." Tron said seriously, raising a finger, "With Phantom and Operator - it's death, life, and power. You can ask any K2-Phantom or higher, and they'll all tell you that the relationship with the Operator comes before all others, and it must be if you want life to be yours, death to be the monsters, and power to be yours in common."</p><br><p>Adam was about to say something, but Tron beat him to it, taking a step forward towards Riska.</p><br><p>"Some say that there can't be as much trust between Phantom and Operator as there is between lovers, but I believe that's not true, and I have a strong argument for it." Tron said in a deep tone, making Adam listen to his every word.</p><br><p>"Phantom and Operator have different statuses - one is subordinate, and the other is ruler, you are not equal, yet you value each other similarly. It is this unique dissonance that allows for an incredible level of trust. Sure, it takes time, like everything else in this world."</p><br><p>Tron sighed: "I realize you're still young, and perhaps it sounds complicated to you, but it's quite simple."</p><br><p>"I am as sure of Riska as I am of myself, and that will always be the case, and no woman, even the most charming, sexy, and caring woman, can outshine Riska, for that woman will be a lover, and Riska an Operator. Operators stand above lovers, above all."</p><br><p>Tron said nothing more, he walked over to Riska, took a glass of champagne in a few gulps, and took her hand.</p><br><p>Soon, they became the fourth couple in the room, dancing more beautifully than anyone else. With their confident moves, Tron and Riska took center stage, and even Edir &amp; Crita didn't compete with them.</p><br><p>Adam stared at them for a while, trying to fully realize Tron's words.</p><br><p>It was worth remarking that Adam had been a simple guy, or rather an ordinary person, all his life.</p><br><p>Like many in his position, he dreamed of getting rich, achieving success, and marrying a beautiful girl to build a family with. Sure, it was a little influenced by the fact that he was a child, but the essence for most common people was similar.</p><br><p>Now, Tron had shattered his understanding of relationships a bit. However, Tron didn't really do anything, he just reminded Adam that he was a Phantom and had to think like a Phantom, not like a mere human.</p><br><p>A place for the Operator began to form in his mind, for some reason, it was above everything, like the sun.</p><br><p>It was unknown how much time had passed, but Adam's blank stare came to normal. His eyes grew deeper, and for some reason, even his Evolutionary Tree shook equally once, as if returning his emotions to normal.</p><br><br><p>Adam took a confident step toward Silvana and Jena, who were still talking casually about something.</p><br><p>Jena was the first to notice Adam since Silvana had her back to him.</p><br><p>Jena's eyes went wide, and a smile appeared on her face.</p><br><p>However... Adam wasn't heading towards her, at least not this time.</p><br><br><p>Adam grabbed Silvana by the shoulder and turned her sharply towards him, making her look at him puzzled. Never before had he done something like this.</p><br><p>"Silvana, I want you to dance with me. Not as a woman or a lover, but as my Operator." Adam spoke up, staring intently at her.</p><br><p>Silvana was silent for a few seconds, then she handed the glass of wine to Jena and held out her hand with her palm slightly bent downward.</p><br><p>"As you wish. You don't know how to dance, so I'll lead." Silvana replied without hesitation.</p><br><p>Adam nodded, took her palm, and headed to the middle of the hall. Oddly enough, Tron and Riska smirked, looked at each other, and stepped aside to make room for the last duet.</p>
