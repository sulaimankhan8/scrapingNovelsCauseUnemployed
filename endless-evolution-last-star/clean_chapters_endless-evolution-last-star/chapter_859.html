            <br><p>One dish after another appeared on Adam's table. Silvana had to help the waiter fit everything in because the girl was determined to fulfill Adam's request to the utmost. The chefs had to work hard to prepare so many items in such a short period.</p><br><br><p>Placing a wide plate with a massive steak in front of Adam, the girl took a step back, folded her arms in front of her.</p><br><p>Her slight smile seemed to glow with energy.</p><br><p>"I hope this can satisfy your hunger. If you need anything, though I doubt it, feel free to contact me."</p><br><p>Adam was silent for a few seconds, his eyes wide, mesmerized by the actual feast.</p><br><p>"Hah..." he gulped, "It's always nice to be understood. All this food, it's just what I needed!"</p><br><p>Without further ado, the girl bowed slightly and headed to the next table. For her, this was just one order out of dozens that she fulfilled every day but rarely did guests order as much as Adam.</p><br><p>At the Twilight Palace, dining in restaurants costs nothing. For nobles, it was more an opportunity to discuss their plans or have a productive conversation than to eat. Adam was different from them, his mind and body demanded to absorb as many calories as possible.</p><br><p>Seeing his hungry eyes, Silvana chuckled.</p><br><p>"Hehehe, you look like you're just going to pounce on that piece of meat. Do you mind if I take a piece from you?"</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyebrow twitched in a crooked grin. Then, he exclaimed:</p><br><p>"That's enough food for a horde!"</p><br><p>Not wanting to waste another second, Adam stabbed his fork into the steak, lifting the whole piece, not even bothering to cut it into slices.</p><br><p>Silvana joined him, choosing the expensive-looking fish, though she was less noisy and used the cutlery as intended.</p><br><p>Previously, no one had paid attention to Adam, he was a regular visitor to the Amber Cloud, moreover, the fight between Giselle and Diron was an important event.</p><br><p>However, now that the food had arrived, his behavior began to bother some of the nobles.</p><br><p>At first, they were confused, they didn't understand why the nobleman appeared so hungry, but soon they realized that Adam wasn't one of them.</p><br><p>Disdain was reflected on their faces, but no one said anything to him directly, only unhappy whispers were heard at some tables.</p><br><p>Were they afraid of Adam?</p><br><p>No, they saw no point in fighting against a commoner, especially in the middle of Amber Cloud after the duel between Giselle and Diron took place here.</p><br><p>The nobles were confident in their victory over the commoner, but such an easy battle after a fight with such important people, they would just disgrace themselves.</p><br><p>"Tsk. How did he even get here?"</p><br><p>"I don't know, now and then commoners find themselves invited, but they always lose so quickly you forget they even exist."</p><br><p>Another voice joined their grumpy conversation.</p><br><p>"Just ignore it. Unfortunately, it's the administration's decision, we're powerless here. I don't advise you to smear your hands on it, defeating such an opponent won't accomplish anything. You can forget about the excellent reputation."</p><br><p>Unlike Adam, who was immersed in a variety of flavors, Silvana could clearly hear their whispers, she sensed the stares directed at them.</p><br><p>She turned to Adam, her mouth ajar, but at the last moment, she stopped, hesitant to say anything.</p><br><p>Instead, she smiled weakly and returned to her dish.</p><br><p>She wasn't interested in the opinions of the others, Adam wasn't doing anything wrong, and...</p><br><p>'Hah, for nobles all that matters is status.' Silvana thought, bringing her fork to her mouth, 'Power decides who is worthy and who is not, so it is their good fortune that they chose not to fight against Adam, otherwise only shame would await them.'</p><br><br><p>Only an hour later, Adam and Silvana left the Amber Cloud. Adam ate more than twenty different dishes and drank dozens of drinks. If he was an ordinary person, he would end up in the hospital.</p><br><p>"Agh! I finally feel satiated! Fuck yeah!"</p><br><p>Adam stretched his arms up, his stomach was ready to explode, but it didn't seem to bother him.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Silvana shared his feelings.</p><br><br><p>She nodded in affirmation.</p><br><p>"The food was excellent, each dish had something unique, new, and undiscovered. I don't usually eat much, but this time, even I couldn't help myself."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes traveled down to her waist.</p><br><p>"I think I should take tomorrow off... A few days of going to restaurants and I'll have to change my outfit again."</p><br><br><p>Adam smiled widely, he put his hands behind the back of his head walking forward nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Seeing these long aisles, and stores like in a real city, it's easy to forget that the Twilight Palace is primarily a hotel."</p><br><p>"What are you trying to say?"</p><br><p>Then, Adam yawned widely, barely covering his mouth with the palm of his hand.</p><br><p>"Well... I had a meal and I want to go to bed. Andreas didn't mention anything about it, but we were supposed to be assigned a suite, weren't we?"</p><br><p>"Right... I'll check it out right away!"</p><br><br><p>Adam was right. Well, in this case, it couldn't be otherwise. The duration of the nobles' stay here depended on the number of coins they had.</p><br><p>Many nobles were losing and winning, balancing between zero and five twilight coins, unable to completely fail or take the final step towards triumph.</p><br><p>They couldn't leave the Twilight Palace, so everyone had their room where they could rest or sleep, just like any other visitor to the hotel, only the southern part.</p><br><br><p>Silvana entered the code that was attached to the message with the hotel map as the door slowly opened.</p><br><p>Adam jerked his head, pointing to the passageway, inviting her to enter first.</p><br><p>With a slight smile, Silvana accepted his silent offer as she stepped forward. Adam followed her, soon the click of the door closing was heard.</p><br><p>While Adam was looking at the expensive interior and the light colors, Silvana's gaze immediately latched onto one detail.</p><br><p>Before jumping to conclusions, she walked around two rooms, one of which was the kitchen, then she returned to the hall.</p><br><p>'Wait... We definitely got one code, we were assigned to only one suite. It's not a problem, but...'</p><br><br><p>'Why is there only one bed?'</p>
