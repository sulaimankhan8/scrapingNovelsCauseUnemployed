            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1163: Connected String</strong></p><br><p>Adam had already completed some of his tasks. As soon as their conversation ended, he would receive a Midnight Crystal that had been set aside for him some time ago. The Gamma Division had done this when he was close to creating the Third Key.</p><br><p>Finding the Twilight Crystal would be much more difficult, but Adam understood that this part of the requirements would be limited to another mission in the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>But, the Dark Heart or the Connected Heart?</p><br><p>Adam had learned how to obtain a Dark Heart, and it was not something he was ready to do right now. He had never fought a Hybrid before, and Nessa didn’t count; she was too weak, just like Adam.</p><br><p>He needed some experience to go into battle against a powerful Hybrid. What’s more, he didn’t even know where they were.</p><br><p>“Adam, unlike the Dark Hearts that only Hybrids possess, every monster has a Connected Heart.”</p><br><p>Damien’s words echoed through Adam’s mind, leaving a puzzled expression on his face.</p><br><p>“Agh? What does that mean? I can go and kill a random monster, and I’ll fulfill one of the conditions for the first star?”</p><br><p>“Not exactly.” Damien shook his head. “The name reflects the essence of these hearts. These monsters are connected and… they are connected to you, Adam.”</p><br><p>Adam had even more questions. He didn’t understand what Damien was talking about.</p><br><p>“Look, you remember the first monster you killed, right?”</p><br><p>Adam nodded uncertainly.</p><br><p>“Yes… The Silver Weaver. I’ll never forget it. That’s how it all started. I remember how you showed me its body, the scientists examining it. You said it was an unknown monster before, was that a lie, and you were just hiding information from me?”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Damien shook his head.</p><br><p>“No, don’t look for conspiracies in everything. Monsters are born from energy, well, in most cases. Sometimes it happens naturally or through eggs, like with humans and animals. I think you’ve seen it many times during your missions.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded weakly, but he wanted to get back to you.</p><br><p>“So, what about the Silver Weaver, is it a new monster?”</p><br><p>“Well, not anymore. Over the past year, since you became a Phantom, other Phantoms have encountered dozens of Silver Weavers. There’s nothing unusual about that. Until the Black Threat Level, it’s impossible to encounter truly unique monsters. However, your Silver Weaver was the first, there’s no doubt about that.”</p><br><p>Adam gulped. “The first… You mean what?”</p><br><p>“Yes. For you, for me, and the entire Citadel, it was the first monster of its kind. You see, despite the World Wipe that cleanses most of the world every 250 years, the world continues to change slowly.</p><br><p>“New monsters are constantly appearing because the energy flows are limitless. It’s not that common towards the end of the World Wipe, but it does happen from time to time. Most likely, the Silver Weaver emerged from the energy, grew strong enough, and, due to its inexperience, got too close to the Citadel.</p><br><p>“It was wounded in battle against other monsters, no Phantoms fought it, otherwise you wouldn’t have been able to ignite your Spark. Then… Well, you know the rest better than anyone.”</p><br><p>With a deep look, Adam nodded. He would never forget that day and the horror that the Silver Weaver had brought upon him. However, it was this monster that allowed Adam to become a Phantom. Without the Silver Weaver, there would be no K4-Phantom Adam Vinter.</p><br><p>“So… How is the Silver Weaver connected to the Connected Hearts?”</p><br><br><p>Damien’s voice grew lower.</p><br><p>“Your abilities, your energy, and your element. All of that stays with you, no matter what global battles or changes you go through. As far as I know, there aren’t many threads left in your abilities, but the needles and cuts are a major part of your power.”</p><br><br><p>Maybe the Silver Weaver didn’t have needles like Adam, but this monster had sharp threads that could cut through anything. Most of the Silver Weaver’s abilities remained in Adam to this day, and it was unlikely that this would ever change.</p><br><p>“You see, Adam, not all elements fall into strict categories, but there is a connection between them. Also, when a monster is born from energy, it doesn’t happen in a chaotic order. What I’m saying is that in the fiery lands where there is only fire and lava and only fire monsters live, there is no way a water or ice monster could be born.”</p><br><p>Adam lowered his gaze as he pondered Damien’s words.</p><br><p>“I see… So, the place where the Silver Weaver was born, wherever it is, is inhabited by monsters with similar abilities, right?”</p><br><p>“Hah.” Damien chuckled. “You’re quick on the uptake. Yes, something like that. There may be several such places. Going back to the fire monsters, for example. Obviously, there are hundreds or even thousands of such places throughout the Dead Lands. Some have more of certain elements, others have less.”</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head, puzzled.</p><br><p>“This… So I have to kill a monster with similar abilities on the Silver Weaver to get the Connected Heart?”</p><br><br><p>“Exactly. However, don’t think about finding a Silver Weaver or other similar monster wandering near the Citadel. You need someone equal to you in strength. Given your level, that would be the Black Threat Monsters.”</p><br><p>Then, Adam’s eyes widened, filling with realization.</p><br><p>“Wait, that means my opponents will be…”</p><br><p>“Elders, the Awakened Monsters, the Black Threat Monsters, and others. It doesn’t matter what kind of monster it is, as long as its characteristics are similar to your Initial Gene and its power level is comparable to yours.”</p><br><p>“But how do I find a suitable monster? Should I ask Silvana to look for monsters with cuts and threads and white energy?”</p><br><p>With a sly grin, Damien waved his hand.</p><br><p>“Nah. It’s much simpler than that. You can find the right monster by referring to your Initial Gene. You see, it’s not just monsters that have the Connected Hearts, but humans too. You are connected to these monsters just as they are connected to you.”</p><br><p>A gleam flashed across Damien’s eyes.</p><br><p>“This method is called the Connected String, and you’ve already done something similar when you hunted a monster to unlock your Lock. I’ll teach you.”</p><br><p>Adam flinched, but his eyes lit up.</p>
