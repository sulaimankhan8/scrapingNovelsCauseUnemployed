            <br><p>As often happens, a banquet with lots of drinks and appetizers was just an excuse, a platform for the beginning of more significant events.
</p><br><p>Adam found himself in such a situation, wanting to find out where his agreement with Franz Balo would lead him. It wasn’t in his plans, but few things in this world happen according to plans, most of the time it’s all down to chance or improvisation.
</p><br><p>Their conversation with Franz had nothing to do with Lona and Max, so when the banquet came to an end they said their goodbyes and headed for the staff exit just as Franz instructed.
</p><br><p>Once at the back of the building, Adam and Silvana noticed a black car parked in the corner under a lone lamp post.
</p><br><p>"No clues, but I think it’s obvious that’s where we’re going, right?" Adam muttered before taking a step forward.
</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, it looks like it. Judging by the car he chose, he didn’t want too many people to know about his visit to this banquet. As we suspected, he’s here on his initiative, otherwise it would be an official visit arranged by Balo Family."
</p><br><p>Adam sighed slightly as he continued to walk forward slowly. He remembered well the car Osana drove to pick him up, something like that only very rich people could afford, it was obvious even to Adam, who was not familiar with car prices.
</p><br><br><p>As soon as they reached the car, the door opened, and a pleasant scent came out, reminiscent of Franz’s perfume.
</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana entered the car, with Franz, sitting across from them, resting his hand on the wine glass stand.
</p><br><p>Before Franz could say anything, the car moved from its spot, heading in an unknown direction.
</p><br><p>"Before we begin, I’d like to get your opinion on this." Franz said in a sweet voice, pointing to a glass of wine and a half-empty bottle nearby.
</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow.
</p><br><br><p>Franz shrugged guiltily.
</p><br><p>"Unfortunately, besides this bottle, I only have two others of a similar variety. So I have to value every drop higher than pure gold, thus... I hope you’ll understand me."
</p><br><p>Then, Franz carefully lifted the glass and handed it to Silvana.
</p><br><p>"Ladies first." Franz smiled.
</p><br><p>Silvana nodded slightly, took the glass from Franz’s hand, and brought it to her nose, taking her first breath.
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, no emotion appeared on Silvana’s face.
</p><br><p>’What...? Based on his words this is a very expensive and rare wine, perhaps unique. I was expecting to sense a pleasant or intense, unusual aroma, but this wine simply has no odor... none.’
</p><br><p>Franz’s corners of his lips curved at Silvana’s reaction, he could feel her confusion. Experience tales with empire
</p><br><p>"Go ahead, be brave. I swear on my family’s honor that the wine is not poisoned. I’ve already taken a few sips myself while I was waiting for you." Franz waved his hand slightly, his movements remaining graceful even here.
</p><br><p>Heeding Franz’s advice, Silvana took the first sip, and her pupils dilated, and a shiver ran through her body.
</p><br><p>Without waiting for Silvana’s reply, Franz snatched the glass from her hands and handed it to Adam. He gestured that he should drink the wine as soon as possible.
</p><br><p>Adam did not refuse, and a few seconds after Silvana took a sip.
</p><br><p>Adam had tasted wine only a few times in his life, and the same was true of all alcohol. It wasn’t that Adam was quite young and didn’t have as many opportunities as an adult, it was that he was from the slums.
</p><br><p>Sure, alcohol was equally popular with all classes of people, rich and poor alike, but... Leona and Gary did everything in their power to prevent Adam from drinking horrible, cheap slum alcohol that was as bad for the body as poison.
</p><br><p>So, Adam was a complete novice to wine, and he might have trouble understanding the taste of an expensive and unique wine for experienced persons.
</p><br><p>But, in this case, it had nothing to do with reality.
</p><br><p>"No way..." Adam gulped, his fingertips shaking and his Evolution Tree trembling along with the waves of goosebumps traveling throughout his body.
</p><br><p>He couldn’t know this for sure, but his body reacted to only one thing this way.
</p><br><p>"This wine... Was it made from monsters?" Adam asked, feeling the same as when he was at the Red Feast or when he ate the Plague Reaper’s heart.
</p><br><p>Franz nodded with a slight smile.
</p><br><p>"Not exactly from monsters, more like berries that grow in the Dead Lands. Getting something like that is not only expensive but also very difficult. No matter how much money or influence you have, the amount of wine is limited."
</p><br><p>Adam slowly turned to Silvana.
</p><br><p>"What do you think?"
</p><br><p>Silvana as if forgetting her manners, licked her lips and said aggressively: "Fuck! I want more!"
</p><br><p>Adam got a strange look on his face, Silvana seemed as if she wasn’t herself.
</p><br><p>Then, Silvana’s pupils returned to normal, as well as the storm of emotions, raging inside.
</p><br><p>Silvana blinked a few times, she remembered what she said and how she felt.
</p><br><p>"What...?" Silvana muttered in confusion, "I controlled myself, but it was still weird..."
</p><br><p>Then, Silvana frowned heavily, glaring menacingly at the smiling Franz.
</p><br><p>"Is that a drug?" Silvana narrowed her eyes, clutching the fabric of her pants.
</p><br><p>Franz bit down on his pinky finger, shaking his head slowly.
</p><br><p>"No, I wouldn’t resort to such lowly methods to get pleasure, it’s the domain of wimps."
</p><br><p>Franz smirked, glancing down at his wine glass.
</p><br><p>"The problem is that you’re inexperienced and that you’re a simple person, and also..." Franz stopped in the middle of a sentence, casting a glance at Adam and Silvana, "Well, it’s too early for that..."
</p><br><p>Then, Franz made a wide sweep of his hand, drawing attention to himself.
</p><br><p>"This wine is special since you can tell it came from the Dead Lands, or rather its main ingredients. You’re like a child who tasted alcohol for the first time, or the first glass of wine. That’s why a mere sip caused you such a reaction. With a little experience, you’ll get used to it."
</p><br><p>Silvana didn’t answer anything since Franz was right. She had no experience with such a rare wine, like Adam she had only tasted a few dishes made with ingredients from the Dead Lands.
</p><br><p>The next ten minutes passed in complete silence.
</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana recalled the taste of the wine, while Franz stared wistfully at the window.
</p><br><p>"Where are we going?" Adam asked after another ten minutes.
</p><br><p>Silvana nodded in agreement.
</p><br><p>"The trip is too long. We demand an explanation."
</p><br><p>Franz turned slowly in their direction.
</p><br><p>"Well, the First Ring isn’t as big as the Second Ring, but there are enough remote places too, where it’s just silence and nature, away from skyscrapers and bright streetlights."
</p><br><p>Franz paused for a moment, he was about to give a full answer but stopped at the last moment.
</p><br><br><p>With a thud, slowly and smoothly the car stalled, then the sounds of the running engine faded away, and the driver’s door opened with a distinct click.
</p><br><br><p>A few footsteps sounded as someone opened the door for Franz.
</p><br><p>"We’re arrived, sir."
</p><br><p>Everyone heard a pleasant, feminine voice, not lacking in sternness and seriousness.
</p><br><p>"Good." Franz smirked, folding his arms into his wide sleeves, "It’s time for some real negotiations."</p>
