            <br><p>"Plague Reaper...? Which scene are you talking about exactly?" Silvana asked with slight excitement in her voice, she glanced at Adam's hands that clutched her shoulders tightly.</p><br><p>Adam noticed it too, so he took a deep breath, bringing himself to his senses.</p><br><p>"Many, but I think every time I recall the exact moment when Plague Reaper should kill me. I mean, in all my fights, that was the first time death was that close to me, and there was nothing I could do about it."</p><br><p>Adam looked away, scratching his neck.</p><br><p>"I was only saved by outside intervention, Osana's timely appearance."</p><br><p>Silvana nodded slowly before sitting down on the corner of the bed and crossing her legs.</p><br><p>"Yeah, I've only been to Dead Lands once, on your... initiative. It was really something. It seems like even the air and wind currents are different there..." Silvana's eyes grew deeper, remembering that important day in their relationship.</p><br><p>After a short pause, Adam glanced at Silvana, a confident smirk evident on his face.</p><br><p>"True, I'm sure I'll enjoy tonight and the performance at the theater, but..." Adam clenched his fist tightly and his gaze became sharper like a hunter's.</p><br><p>An unusual aura emanated from him, drawing Silvana's attention, making her feel a strange, pleasant fear.</p><br><p>"There's no way this can compare to a bloody, brutal fight against monsters who have only one goal, just like you - to win in order to survive."</p><br><p>Silvana tilted her head slightly, leaning on her hand with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>'Well, well, it seems my Phantom is thirsty for blood, that's not surprising, I'm sure he misses the feeling of a real battle.' Silvana smiled slyly, 'He'll get what he wants soon enough.'</p><br><br><p>The institute Lona attended was in the Second Ring, but the theater where she was performing this evening with the other actors was in the First Ring. It was a place where wealthy and influential people often came to enjoy high-class shows.</p><br><p>Perhaps in the first times of appearing in the First Ring, Adam felt uncomfortable and out of place, but now there was no trace of that.</p><br><p>He got out of the car with Silvana and looked around.</p><br><p>Such events weren't usual for him, as this was the first time he'd ever gone to the theater, but this level of society didn't seem like anything special to him anymore.</p><br><p>People like Magnus, or powerful Phantoms, had a much higher status than just rich and influential people. Adam understood that clearly now.</p><br><p>"Wow, I didn't realize it would be this big..." Adam muttered raising his head to fully appreciate the size of the theater.</p><br><p>Unlike Adam's expectation of seeing some ancient structure or temple-like structure, in front of him was a modernist building from the materials to the vision of the architect who designed it.</p><br><p>The theater was part of a massive building in the shape of an obsidian obelisk, a thin figure growing slightly wider towards the bottom with a twisted body.</p><br><p>The top was at a straight angle with a sharp end, as if it had once been a cube but someone had made a precise cut with a huge sword, cutting away all the excess.</p><br><p>The entire building was covered with sturdy, black slabs that reflected the glow of the streetlights that covered every street in the First Ring.</p><br><p>The center of the building stood out, the area where the theater was located, its part of the building covered with amber glass panels, giving the place both mystery and majesty.</p><br><p>Silvana shrugged before stepping forward and taking Adam's hand like a lady.</p><br><p>"There's more than just the theater here, but that's all we're interested in today as well as all of these people." Silvana said with a wave of her hand pointing to over a hundred people, this was just a fraction, some people were entering the theater while others were arriving here in luxury cars.</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head.</p><br><p>"Yeah, now I'm feeling it again. Places like this are not for me."</p><br><p>Silvana threw him a confused look.</p><br><p>"Hmm? I thought by now you should stop being amazed at the opulence of the First Ring and the kind of people there are here."</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam shook his head before glancing away:</p><br><p>"Nah, that's not the point. I mean, all these people, this place, everything is trying to seem so important, so flashy and arrogant, all these expensive cars and outfits and confident smirks, they're just everywhere and there's nothing wrong with that."</p><br><p>A random stream of wind swept by them, ruffling Adam's hair tips, his gaze becoming calmer and deeper.</p><br><p>"However... none of this has anything to do with reality. Even leaving the Phantoms out of the equation, there are people far more powerful than those gathered here. And, those people are minding their own business in distant corridors and dark rooms."</p><br><p>Experience more on empire</p><br><p>Silvana nodded, she considered the situation and looked towards the entrance.</p><br><br><br><p>A man in a red vest and white shirt said, put his palm to his chest and bowed slightly, taking the tickets from Silvana's hand.</p><br><p>"I hope you enjoy tonight's show."</p><br><p>Silvana smiled, nodding her head slightly.</p><br><p>From the moment they stepped away from the car and reached the entrance, there were constant glances thrown at them. People recognized it was Adam.</p><br><p>Some of the women cast envious stares at his companion, but upon realizing it was his Operator, they breathed a sigh of relief.</p><br><p>"You know... I'm starting to miss the Red Feast more and more, now that's a high-level event with high stakes, for everyone..." Adam smirked remembering the moment when an employee of the Red Feast killed an ordinary man for breaking the rules, brutally and elegantly at the same time.</p><br><p>Silvana's corners of her lips curved up.</p><br><p>"You know, since we were invited once by Magnus, we can visit the Red Feast again."</p><br><br><p>"Nah, just coming and eating monster meat will certainly be delicious, but it's not the same. The Red Feast is a special event, it should be just like it was for the first time."</p><br><p>Saying that, Adam couldn't help but remember how, thanks to Osana, he visited a private Red Feast, organized especially for the two of them.</p><br><br><p>After a few steps, Adam and Silvana reached the end of the passage and arrived in the main hall, where bright lights were coming from the stage.</p>
