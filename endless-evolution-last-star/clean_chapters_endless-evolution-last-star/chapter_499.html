            <br><br><p>The hand fell to the ground, clots of blood flying apart covering the amber resin. After a few bounces off the surface, the hand stopped, leaving a smeared trail of dark blood behind.</p><br><p>Adam smirked as he reached to his side with his left hand, pulling out two glass shards, then did the same with the shards in his neck.</p><br><p>"Argh... How unpleasant... It feels like a fire in my throat..." Adam grunted, his voice hoarse and harsh.</p><br><p>The shrapnel had damaged his neck, but he could continue to breathe, albeit with some difficulty.</p><br><p>"By the looks of it, you've figured it out by now, haven't you?" Tron said in a calm tone.</p><br><p>Adam shrugged with a bitter smile on his face.</p><br><p>"About your blade...? H-Hah... Some things I've become aware of... Gha..."</p><br><p>Adam spat out a clot of blood, feeling worse with each passing second.</p><br><p>Tron nodded deeply. He realized that Adam could not fight in his current state. His main arm was missing and his neck was damaged, he had too many wounds even though the fight hadn't even fully started yet.</p><br><br><p>Slowly, Tron's palm touched Adam's chest.</p><br><p>"Though the outcome of this round is already decided, but I warned you. Dahla will only heal you when the situation becomes critical."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide when realization came to him, but it was already too late.</p><br><p>Red trickles of blood flowed from Adam's wide cut on his chest, coating Tron's palm, running down his fingers on their way to his wrist.</p><br><br><p>Tron's eyes sparkled as the energy traveled down his arm.</p><br><p>Purple particles of energy came out, turning into a flash of flame before expanding, exploding into Tron's palm.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes reflected the bright explosion, blinding him for a moment. The shockwave threw him aside, causing him to hit solid amber resin.</p><br><p>"Argh!!!" Adam cried out in pain in his hoarse voice while flame bits continued to burn on his body, bringing with them the final destruction.</p><br><p>Tron narrowed his eyes, staring intently at Adam's chest.</p><br><p>The explosion had left an open wound on Adam's torso, bleeding in many places along with severe burns.</p><br><p>But... for some reason, there was a look of surprise in Tron's gaze.</p><br><p>'Oh, what a sturdy body, or was he intuitively using the Energy Control? Well, I have yet to find out.'</p><br><br><p>Despite his wounds and the pain from the burn, Adam still hadn't lost consciousness. He made attempts to stand up, leaning his one arm against the wall.</p><br><p>If there was another person in his place with a body as strong as Adam's, that person would have passed out from the pain and shock long ago.</p><br><p>Adam's experience allowed him to endure severe pain and serious wounds much easier, he was used to them, and his body already adapted.</p><br><p>So the loss of an arm, a few cuts, a damaged neck, and a torn chest wound was not something that would make him lose the will to fight or tremble with fear.</p><br><p>All of his organs were intact, which meant there was no threat to life. It was enough for Adam and his mind to not think about pain too much and focus on his goal.</p><br><p>'Well, that's enough for now. He made me show too much for the first round.' Tron pondered before striking the ground with his blade.</p><br><br><p>Half of his blade shattered, and many large glass shards lay on the ground like lost mirrors.</p><br><br><p>Tron brought his arm back, then thrust his blade forward, aiming straight for Adam's left shoulder.</p><br><p>Sure, there was too much distance between them, so Tron could only pierce the air with his half-broken weapon.</p><br><p>But, the glass shards got their orders.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The shards shuddered before flying in the same direction as Tron's swing.</p><br><p>Adam looked up only to see a multitude of shards that a second later like a flurry of blades stabbed into the left side of his body.</p><br><p>"Tsk!" Adam gritted his teeth to keep from screaming in pain as he looked at the glass shards sticking out of his body. Blood covered their tips, unable to get any higher, it trickled down in bloody droplets falling to the ground.</p><br><p>'Hah... He's definitely pointing at my shoulder, but only a few shards hit the right spot. So the farther the distance, the less accurate it is, right? Well... It makes sense, but it's a good thing I found that out...' Adam pondered as an ironic smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>Step. Step. Another step.</p><br><p>Adam took a few steps, his body swaying from one side to the other, struggling to keep his balance.</p><br><br><p>With a thud, Adam fell to the ground, unable to stay conscious any longer.</p><br><p>Even after all the attacks, Tron hadn't damaged Adam's organs, but Adam lost too much blood.</p><br><p>"Oh, looks like it's finally my turn to intervene." Dahla said calmly before taking the last sip of tea as if the situation wasn't critical.</p><br><p>Then, she stood up and walked through the amber barrier, walking with a confident gait towards Adam, who was breathing slowly.</p><br><p>"That explosion... Does Tron possess a flame? I thought his main weapon was glass." Silvana asked, slightly confused.</p><br><p>She had been impressed with the sharpness of Tron's blade since it had cut off Adam's arm in one swing. But she thought the blast could be much stronger and it would kill Adam if Tron didn't control his power.</p><br><p>Riska shook her head with a kind smile on her face.</p><br><p>"No, not really. I mean, if the energy doesn't have some distinct shape then pretty much everything will appear to be flame. But, Tron doesn't have fire abilities."</p><br><p>Silvana frowned, staring intently at the burns on Adam's body. She understood what Riska was talking about.</p><br><p>It wasn't just hot flames that could cause burns, and it wasn't just fire that could explode, an ice explosion was quite possible even with technology, with energy it was just as easy to do as the fire version.</p><br><p>"Honestly I'm surprised that after the explosion, Adam ended up with such weak wounds. After all, Tron is on the edge of the K2." Riska said nonchalantly.</p><br><p>Then, her eyes went wide as she slowly turned looking at Silvana whose eyes were narrowed in suspicion.</p><br><p>"What? What did you say? Tron is on the edge of the K2?"</p><br><br><p>"Oh... I let it slip. Tron won't like that. Well... Yeah, Tron tricked Adam and you. He lowered his power because he didn't want Adam to feel insignificant and incapable of anything." Riska explained biting her lip.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide for a moment.</p><br><p>"Hah, what a sly one. That's a good thing though. In that case, the difference in strength isn't so great that Adam will lose the will to fight. He can't win, but at least he'll have a chance to wound Tron."</p><br><p>Riska nodded silently, her gaze sad, filled with regret.</p><br><p>Silvana realized the situation as she leaned forward, touching Riska's shoulder.</p><br><p>"Hey, there's no need to be upset. We don't have to tell Tron about this, right?"</p><br><p>Then, Riska shook her head and glanced at Tron.</p><br><p>"No, I don't have to, but I'm not going to hide anything from him. He warned me not to tell you or Adam about it, yet I made a mistake, so..."</p><br><p>Silvana wanted to say something, but at the same time, Tron sensed something and turned towards them.</p><br><p>It only took him a moment to realize from Riska's facial expression what had happened.</p>
