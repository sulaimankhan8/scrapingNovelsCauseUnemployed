            <br><p>Experience was a valuable resource and often a useful weapon, it allowed one to prevent past mistakes and avoid bigger ones, but to get something first it was always necessary to pay a price for it. In the case of experience, the price was always the same: failure.</p><br><p>Adam knew this well, experience allowed him to react lightning fast to the Sacrificial Holder's attack, ignoring the piercing pain in his shoulder.</p><br><p>For the same reason, he didn't stop at a single attack. Most inexperienced Phantoms would not have cut off their opponent's head and continued to attack senselessly, there was no point in being too bloodthirsty and wasting energy.</p><br><p>However, Adam felt that he had to destroy the Sacrificial Holder, he didn't know if the vines could act if the Sacrificial Holder lost its head or not.</p><br><p>He continued to slice with his needle until he turned the monster into meat cubes scattered in front of the gates.</p><br><p>Twitch. Twitch. Twitch.</p><br><p>Unlike the Sacrificial Holder's body parts, the cut vines continued to jerk, wanting to fuse together.</p><br><p>The two short pieces were too close, just enough for them to be able to touch each other and immediately recover their wounds.</p><br><p>"Tsk, it's certainly not what the Regenerative Monsters are capable of, but it looks pretty damn annoying."</p><br><p>With a great grimace on his face, Adam kicked the vine to the side, tossing it to the far side of the cave under a low layer of water.</p><br><p>'Are you okay? I didn't even notice that attack. It was really fast.' Silvana was concerned.</p><br><p>Your journey continues with My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Adam nodded, guiding his palm to his shoulder.</p><br><p>"Yeah, I didn't expect such a weak-looking opponent who can't even use his hands to be so fast."</p><br><p>Looking at his bloody fingers, a grimace appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"Fuck, getting such a deep wound in such an inconvenient place... that's such a big mistake, especially considering the effect of the energy here!"</p><br><p>Yet, after a few seconds, Adam realized something was off.</p><br><br><p>The blood on his fingers was quickly disappearing, no... or rather it was fleeing from his skin turning into wide red ribbons like paper quickly intertwining with each other.</p><br><p>The ribbons traveled to the wound on his shoulder where the same thing was happening, less and less blood, more and more ribbons. Then, the ribbons began to enter the wound, returning to their place, quickly healing it.</p><br><p>It didn't take much time, but in a few minutes, there would be no trace of the gaping wound in Adam's shoulder, which affected Adam's muscles and tendons.</p><br><p>Before he could wonder, Adam's eyes went wide as he ran sharply, but not towards the gate, but towards the distant caverns.</p><br><p>Whoooooooooooooooooh.</p><br><p>A few seconds later, like a shadow, Adam found himself outside of the crimson mist, it had not yet reached that point, the mist was spreading slowly but surely.</p><br><p>As soon as it did, the bloody ribbons shuddered, spilling out in trickles of blood slowly dripping from the wound on his shoulder.</p><br><p>He received a strange expression while standing only a few meters away from the crimson mist.</p><br><p>"Hah, is this some kind of joke?"</p><br><p>Wanting to be fully convinced of his theory, Adam stepped forward reaching out his hand towards the mist, letting it touch his fingertip.</p><br><p>"The energy in the fortress in addition to enhancing flame abilities significantly lowers regeneration, though the runes have partially solved that problem..."</p><br><p>As it progressed, the mist covered Adam's arm wanting to reach his wound and heal it again.</p><br><p>"But... the energy from that creepy gate, on the other hand, enhances regeneration, significantly..."</p><br><p>Soon, he heard Silvana's serious voice.</p><br><p>'Adam... I'm afraid this is bad news for you. The enhanced regeneration extends to monsters as well. You'll need to spend considerably more energy to make sure a monster is dead than without this effect.'</p><br><p>However, Adam did not share her opinion.</p><br><p>He shook his head with a satisfied smirk.</p><br><p>"Nah, that's not a problem. I have enough strength for all of them. If there are many opponents, one of them will get me sooner or later, it can't be avoided."</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam stepped forward, letting the crimson mist completely cover him, he confidently strode straight towards the Serpent Gates.</p><br><p>The bloody ribbons reappeared quickly healing his wound.</p><br><p>As he passed by the Sacrificial Holder, the corners of his lips turned upwards. He was right not to give the monster a chance to recover with crimson mist.</p><br><p>Before disappearing behind the gates, Adam paused, directing his gaze upward.</p><br><p>"I don't know if the mist is going to make it to the upper levels or stop at the caves, but during the eclipse, it's going to be a real problem considering how many monsters are in the waves..."</p><br><p>'You still don't want to help them?'</p><br><p>Silvana decided to try again to change Adam's mind, even though she knew it was futile.</p><br><p>'Just...' She bit her lip muttering to herself, 'Adam, with your power, the number of victims will definitely be reduced...'</p><br><p>In response, Adam only waved his hand, turning his back to the caves, the darkness beyond the gate engulfing his silhouette.</p><br><p>"Nah, they'll have to manage without me. I did them a big favor by defeating three commanders. Hah, the Solitary Commander alone would have killed several Phantoms, the other two I don't care about."</p><br><p>Silvana said nothing more, she couldn't argue with Adam since he was right. He didn't owe any of the Phantoms in the fortress anything, moreover, he had actually secured the fortress for them.</p><br><p>Yet, Adam felt that deep down inside it upset Silvana, she didn't want the Phantoms to die.</p><br><p>Stopping in the middle of the dark passage, Adam smiled weakly.</p><br><p>"Though I can't see you, I can feel your cheeks puffing up. Come on, think about it from the other side."</p><br><p>There was only tense silence from the other end.</p><br><p>"We don't know what lies beyond the gate, but someone strong and dangerous lurks there since that's where the First Wall leads me."</p><br><p>At the same moment, black particles appeared beside him, showing that he was right.</p><br><br><p>"Just think about the fact that I'm going on a special mission to destroy a unique enemy. It will save a lot of lives in the aftermath."</p><br><br><p>Silvana only snorted arrogantly.</p><br><p>'As if that's your real goal. You just want to find someone to fight with!'</p><br><p>"Hah, you got me, but..."</p><br><p>In a moment, Adam's eyes became colder and his tone lower. This change affected Silvana as well.</p><br><p>"I don't just want a battle, I'm going to move on. I've stayed at K2-Level for too long, and I'll soon fix that."</p><br><br><p>Adam disappeared into the darkness when in his wake the Serpent Gates came into motion. Slowly, with a rumble, the massive gates closed.</p><br><p>But... a gap was left between the two serpents, letting in the crimson mist that slowly filled the caverns, bringing with it both new possibilities and potential misery.</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A white and purple crystal, trembling slightly, was one of the projectiles that fell in the starfall. Unlike the others, it didn't explode, retaining a powerful energy.</p><br><p>Slowly, a lone trickle of blood reached the crystal, coating the bottom of it, the trickle traveling a long way down the stairs from one defeated warrior.</p><br><p>The Blind Commander lay among the rubble, on broken crates with boards soaked in his blood, breathing slowly.</p><br><p>He could feel that there was energy nearby, he understood what was happening and he knew about the Phantoms, the Eclipse, and the waves of monsters.</p><br><br><p>He did not move, even though the opportunity was so close.</p><br><p>The Blind Commander enjoyed his inner silence, at least until the real threat to the fortress appeared.</p><br><p>A threat against which the Phantoms would be powerless.</p>
