            <h4>Chapter 1029: Same Wound Again</h4><br><p>Events around the world continued, whether it was the Dead Lands, the Citadel, or even the mysterious Dark Shore. The Fallen Ring Castle was particularly active.
</p><br><p>Three whole days had passed since Adam and Risha’s victory over the main enemies of the serpents. That was enough time for everyone to celebrate the victory and to get to work on rebuilding their liberated home.
</p><br><p>However, Adam still hadn’t woken up, unlike Risha, who continued to train, using the time she had left at the Fallen Ring Castle.
</p><br><p>After Adam wakes up, they will leave the area and are unlikely to encounter any of the serpents. Perhaps Adam and Risha would die in battle in a few weeks, perhaps some Phantom squad would arrive at the Fallen Ring Castle and wipe out all the serpents. It was an unknown.
</p><br><br><p>Risha swung her axe, throwing Heret and Vorx away from her.
</p><br><p>If she used all her abilities, she could probably defeat them in a 1 vs 2 fight, but she didn’t want to hurt them. It was just a simple warm-up since she had nothing else to do.
</p><br><p>"Good job." Heret nodded deeply, running a hand down her arm. The wide scar from Arnoth’s sword remained on his torso.
</p><br><p>Vorx smirked. "Hah, if you had fought as well in the beginning, I wouldn’t have to create that blast!"
</p><br><p>"Hah!" Risha slammed her axe into the ground. "Sorry, but I wasn’t the one on the ground! Anyway, I won, right?"
</p><br><p>"Sure, no one’s arguing with that."
</p><br><p>They were about to continue. A gleam passed across their eyes as their legs tensed.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, Grita appeared in the aisle, making them turn around.
</p><br><p>With a slight smile, she nodded. "You’ll have to put your training on hold. Adam is awake."
</p><br><br><p>Coming out of the dream, like deep darkness, Adam struggled to open his eyes.
</p><br><p>It took him almost half a minute to adjust to the light and make out a silhouette in the corner of the room.
</p><br><p>A girl, a serpent, like the rest of them, noticed that he was awake and immediately ran up to him with slight concern.
</p><br><p>"Mr. Adam! You’re finally awake! How are you feeling?"
</p><br><p>Her voice with a friend reached Adam’s mind, he could only understand a fraction of her words.
</p><br><p>"F-Fuck... What a headache..." Adam frowned before collapsing back onto the bed.
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, he was able to make out the girl, her scarlet shoulder length hair and green eyes with vertical pupils.
</p><br><p>"How long have I been asleep? From the looks of it... Quite a while, right?"
</p><br><p>The girl nodded approvingly.
</p><br><p>"Ughum! It’s been a little over three days!"
</p><br><p>Then, she smiled weakly.
</p><br><p>"The others and I were beginning to worry that your wounds were too severe, though we used every means to help you recover more quickly!"
</p><br><br><p>Dense layers of bandages peeked out from beneath the fresh clothes that the usual serpent guards wore. The style wasn’t quite his, but that wasn’t what he cared about right now.
</p><br><p>His body was full of energy, this side of him was at its peak and was much stronger than before the fight against Arnoth. However, his body and mind needed a long rest.
</p><br><p>His bandages were clean, and no bloodstains were visible, which meant all of his wounds were already healed.
</p><br><br><p>"Damn, again?" Adam muttered tiredly, touching his left shoulder. "Last time I lost my right arm, now my left... Hah, that day it was my decision."
</p><br><p>The girl’s eyes went wide as she leaned forward out of curiosity.
</p><br><p>"What, you’ve lost your arm once before? That... I wouldn’t be able to keep fighting after that!"
</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly.
</p><br><p>"As if I had a choice. In fact, it’s not as big a problem as it seems. The hardest part is recovering a lost limb."
</p><br><p>Pensive, the girl touched her lips.
</p><br><p>"I see... But! I’m sure the leaders will figure something out!"
</p><br><br><br><p>At the same moment, the door opened, and behind it were several figures.
</p><br><p>The first person Adam saw was Risha, which was good news for him.
</p><br><p>"Adam! You’re finally awake!" she exclaimed, about to jump on him just like at the castle.
</p><br><p>But, this time, there was someone to save him.
</p><br><br><p>Vorx and Heret simultaneously grabbed her by the shoulders, not letting her get too far away.
</p><br><p>"Shh, he just woke up. Or do you want him to fall into slumber again, but this time for a week?"
</p><br><p>Risha puffed up her cheeks, trying to get out of their grip.
</p><br><p>"Hey! Let me go! Adam has defeated Arnoth! He’s not weak enough to pass out over something like that!"
</p><br><p>Grita and Torz caught his gaze.
</p><br><p>"We’re all glad you came to your senses."
</p><br><p>"Yeah, I didn’t believe in you kid," Torz shrugged. "But, we all have to admit that you did what our king and queen couldn’t. Arnoth and Kreyna are defeated, once and for all!"
</p><br><p>Eventually, Risha managed to get out of her grip and pounced on Adam, but he didn’t even bother trying to dodge.
</p><br><p>He couldn’t help but feel the joy of victory.
</p><br><p>When he went to the Cave Grid he just wanted to do Orel’s quest and defeat an S4-monster to earn himself a reputation, but he ended up defeating an S5-monster.
</p><br><p>’Hmm, Arnoth and Kreyna...’ Adam thought, staring at one point. ’They were stronger than normal S5-monsters, especially Arnoth. From what I know, Kreyna couldn’t defeat him even if he was without Lost Light.’
</p><br><br><p>Someone poked him in the shoulder.
</p><br><br><p>"What are you thinking about?" Vorx asked with an excited expression. "You can breathe a sigh of relief, you won’t be fighting anyone anytime soon. Here at the Fallen Ring Castle, you have no more enemies, and neither do we!"
</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head awkwardly.
</p><br><p>"I was just remembering my fight... It was a tough ordeal."
</p><br><p>"But you made it through." Torz’s deep voice boomed out. "It’s good you’re awake now. I wouldn’t want to keep everyone else waiting any longer."
</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow in puzzlement.
</p><br><p>Torz jerked his head toward the aisle.
</p><br><p>"It’s not just your victory, Adam, it’s a victory for all of us, so it’s time to have a feast!"</p>
