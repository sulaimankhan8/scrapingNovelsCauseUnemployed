            <br><p>After almost two weeks of training at the Magma Plateau, everyone had gotten significantly stronger, especially Adam, who was able to step up.</p><br><br><p>Sure, thanks to the sparring against Vorx and Heret she had learned a lot. It was always good to fight against fighters that were much stronger. But, it wasn't enough, Risha wanted more, she wanted to reach Adam's level.</p><br><p>She had previously succeeded in doing something similar.</p><br><p>During the fight against Vorx, Adam opened his third lesser gates, Risha did it a few hours later trying to deal with the Rock Worms.</p><br><p>But, the fourth lesser gate was an unyielding wall that she couldn't even scratch despite her best efforts.</p><br><br><p>Adam stopped Torz, drawing attention to himself.</p><br><p>His words raced through Risha's mind time after time.</p><br><p>Did he have a chance to help her?</p><br><br><p>Risha had no answers, but she was eager to know. Deep down she wanted to figure things out on her own, not to depend on anyone, but she wasn't so foolish to refuse help.</p><br><p>Moreover, their time was running out.</p><br><p>Even if the Light Legion would only arrive by the twentieth day, they didn't have more than a week left to prepare.</p><br><p>"Hey, Risha, do you want to obtain the External Artifact? Not just an essence, but an actual ally like mine?" Adam asked with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>At the same time, a flame ignited on his right hand from a piece of black coat. Lone Blaze revealed herself, reminding Risha what she lacked to be a full-fledged K3-Phantom.</p><br><p>"But... We don't have time for this. While you were sleeping, Silvana told me about your history with Lone Blaze. Hah, I didn't have that opportunity..." Risha smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>Deep inside, she envied Adam. His journey at the Fortress of the Lone Serpent was as dangerous as it was rewarding.</p><br><p>A smirk played across Adam's face as he waved his hand. "Well, we don't need to look for anything. A single, brazen External Artifact is right here."</p><br><p>Risha's eyes went wide, filling with meaning.</p><br><p>Before she or anyone else could say anything, the star-crystal shuddered, releasing streams of energy in their direction.</p><br><p>The mirror chamber engulfed Risha, plunging her into Radiant Mirage space.</p><br><p>Adam took a step back, watching his reflection in the mirror curiously.</p><br><p>"Hmm, not bad, not bad at all," he tilted his head.</p><br><br><p>Vorx approached from the side. He had questions for Adam, but in general, he understood the situation.</p><br><p>"Do you think this could work?" he was doubtful. "We all saw that you found a way to pressure Radiant Mirage, but I don't see any reason for him to agree to be Risha's partner."</p><br><p>"Don't worry. I've made arrangements for everything. If Risha agrees to the terms, they'll make a deal."</p><br><p>A slight joy appeared in Vorx's eyes. "That sounds great! But... What happens if things don't go according to plan?"</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam glanced at him. "You mean if their deal gets canceled or the terms aren't met?"</p><br><p>"More about the latter, yeah."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly, continuing to stare at his reflection in the mirror.</p><br><p>"Well, in that case, Risha will just die. Given the terms of the deal, if she fails, she'll become a mere power source for Radiant Mirage."</p><br><p>Vorx's face turned pale, the others' eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>The worst part was they realized that Adam was wrong, even though the conditions were insane!</p><br><p>"No..." Heret shook his head. "This is some kind of nonsense. Who would even agree to such conditions for some artifact?"</p><br><p>Adam didn't answer anything, he just took a few steps back, pointing at the mirrored chamber.</p><br><p>"Not many, it's a big risk," he muttered, then the corners of his mouth went up. "But that doesn't apply to her!"</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The mirrored chamber shattered as streams of energy swept along the entire Magma Plateau in a wild whirlwind.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a mechanical, stern voice rang out from the star-crystal. Radiant Mirage had a message for all of them.</p><br><p>[Risha and I have reached an agreement on a deal... I think you realize I'm talking about the pact, and thanks to Adam, you know what the stakes are. Risha and I will fight, so... You'll have to be spectators.]</p><br><p>Then, the energy streams turned into hundreds of glass fragments, quickly forming a dome covering 70% of the Magma Plateau.</p><br><p>[Everyone except Risha, step outside the dome... otherwise, you will endanger her life... According to the terms of the pact, she must fight against me... If she cannot do so, she will fail the conditions...]</p><br><p>No further explanation was needed.</p><br><p>Everyone understood what it meant.</p><br><p>Vorx and Heret exchanged glances and turned into flashes, disappearing outside the dome. Grita and Torz followed them.</p><br><p>The dome was made of glass, so they could see everything that was going on inside.</p><br><p>The only one who was in no hurry to leave was Adam.</p><br><p>He caught Risha's gaze. "I knew you'd accept. Don't think it will be easy. I've never fought against an External Artifact myself, but I'm sure Radiant Mirage is pretty strong."</p><br><p>"Agh..." Risha took a deep breath, throwing her axe onto her shoulder. "It's not like I had any other choice. If I'd said no, I'd constantly think of it as a missed opportunity."</p><br><p>Adam lifted his chin, looking at her intently.</p><br><p>"Yeah, but if you died, you wouldn't be able to think at all, would you?"</p><br><p>"Pffft!" Risha snorted mockingly. "Don't try to scare me with the death of a Light Phantom, I've faced it many times. Moreover, if I don't get stronger, Kreyna will smash me to the ground. It's better to die trying to break through your limits than from an arrogant monster who doesn't see you as an equal."</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Well, good luck. Remember the terms of your pact... Winning isn't the only thing you have to demonstrate..."</p><br><p>Adam's last words stumped Risha, but when she turned around, he had already disappeared, showing up on the far side of the Magma Plateau.</p><br><p>At the same time, the star-crystal shone brightly, creating a massive mirror out of energy not far from the dark field.</p><br><p>The first trial for Risha was ready to begin.</p>
