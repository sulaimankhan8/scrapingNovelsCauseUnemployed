            <br><p>The viewers barely got a glimpse of what was going on inside the flaming vortex, how Adam left a wide cut on Fromund’s chest, and how close he was to victory.
</p><br><p>They were equally strong opponents, so one cut in the right place would be enough to win.
</p><br><p>Fromund was a human, not a monster, he had no defense against an armor-piercing weapon like Adam’s needle.
</p><br><p>Someone was already smiling broadly, confident that his bet on Adam’s victory had succeeded and that he would soon have a fortune in his account.
</p><br><p>But, it was too early to draw any conclusions.
</p><br><p>Silvana gasped, covering her wide-open mouth with her hand.
</p><br><p>"What happened...? I mean... I mean, he’s almost finished his attack!"
</p><br><p>Only one person could give her a definite answer, Arayna grinned widely crossing her arms across her chest.
</p><br><p>"Hah, did you think my Phantom would lose so quickly?"
</p><br><p>Throwing a hard stare at Arayna, Silvana asked with narrowed eyes: "What is it? What did Fromund just do?"
</p><br><p>Instead of a quick answer, Arayna simply straightened her arm - pointing at Fromund.
</p><br><p>The pillar of flame subsided, the last bits of fire passing in front of Fromund’s eyes.
</p><br><p>His heart continued to beat rapidly, but it wasn’t just the speed, it gradually decreased to normal.
</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.
</p><br><p>The beating of his heart became louder and louder as if he was not a human but a robot, and instead of a heart, he had a powerful engine.
</p><br><p>Soon, even the spectators in the farthest seats could clearly hear the muffled sounds coming from Fromund, wave after wave with no intention of stopping.
</p><br><p>The Phantoms narrowed their eyes, some decided to use a Gene Field since everyone was using it for one purpose, to see what was hiding inside the Fromund, no one was going to start a fight over it.
</p><br><p>Arayna pointed to Fromund’s chest.
</p><br><br><p>Silvana’s gaze lowered.
</p><br><p>A bright light burned beneath Fromund’s chest, shining through his flesh and bones in the heart area as if a small sun arose inside.
</p><br><p>Along with the powerful heartbeat, Fromund’s body temperature increased, causing the trickles of blood flowing down his chest to quickly dry up, turning into dark trails.
</p><br><br><p>Hot steam copiously came out at Fromund’s sigh, slowly heading upwards in multiple streams.
</p><br><p>"Is that... Is that his Second Order or Initial One?" Silvana asked turning to Arayna.
</p><br><p>She didn’t have to reveal her Phantom’s secrets, but the fight was already underway and they were both ordinary people, no one could influence the fight, so there was no point in hiding anything anymore.
</p><br><p>Arayana chuckled, showing that Silvana’s assumptions were wrong.
</p><br><p>"No, you’ll know when he does it. What affects his heart, or rather his body is his Artifact."
</p><br><p>"Artifact...?" Silvana nodded slowly, "An active artifact. From what I understand, it amplifies his body, but... at what cost?"
</p><br><p>Leaning forward, wanting to examine Silvana’s reaction, her focused face, Arayna smiled weakly: "Energy and heat. Unfortunately, he won’t be able to keep his artifact active indefinitely, even if he had an unlimited supply of energy."
</p><br><p>Silvana raised an eyebrow, doubt in her eyes.
</p><br><p>"Hmm? I can’t know for sure, but it doesn’t look like Fromund is getting hot from his fire."
</p><br><p>"That’s right." Arayna folded her hands behind her back, "In that case, you realize how powerful the artifact’s effect is if even Fromund is about to get burnt."
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Arayna’s voice became firmer.
</p><br><p>"But... Fromund hasn’t reached that point yet. If I or any other ordinary person were near him right now, they would get serious skin burns, yet for him, it’s like standing under the warm rays of the sun, for now..."
</p><br><br><p>Heavy footsteps dispersed across the arena, leaving black marks from the hot boots that somehow withstood the heat from Fromund’s body.
</p><br><p>The artifact continued to work, making his heart beat louder and louder, increasing all aspects of his already considerable physical power.
</p><br><p>Streams of scarlet energy that looked exactly like flame encircled his heart as an active vortex, with each heartbeat some of the fire turned into waves traveling through every part of his body in the same way as blood, only to soon return, waiting for a new, more powerful heartbeat.
</p><br><br><p>Clutching the hilt of his hammer tightly, Fromund jerked his arm, without any trouble pulling out his heavy weapon with only one hand.
</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.
</p><br><p>Fromund’s heart came to its usual speed, even became a little slower, but remained still as loud.
</p><br><p>Then, he took a deep breath and smiled widely, directing his gaze forward.
</p><br><p>"Hey, did you really want to end our fight early?"
</p><br><p>Crumble. Crumble. Crumble.
</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam climbed out of the wall, throwing chunks of stone aside.
</p><br><p>The barrier of the colosseum only protected the outermost part of the arena, so everything inside, including the walls was destructible and could be demolished during the battle.
</p><br><p>These were regular materials, not something special from Dead Lands, so rebuilding the arena after a long and colorful battle was a pretty quick and not the most difficult task.
</p><br><br><p>Adam dropped to one knee, slowly getting up and guiding his hand to his chest, feeling the still-hot burn.
</p><br><p>"You... What the hell was that?" Adam narrowed his eyes looking at Fromund’s body that with every beat of his heart shuddered slightly.
</p><br><p>Fromund lifted his chin, a satisfied smirk was on his face.
</p><br><p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.
</p><br><p>Ruffling his hair to knock the dust off, Adam’s eyes grew darker.
</p><br><p>All he remembered was a bright flash blazed across Fromund’s chest, then a fiery fist slammed into his chest, throwing him far beyond the vortex.
</p><br><p>Clenching his hand into a fist, Fromund frowned. He was inactive, so the heat increased slowly, but he was still wasting his limited time.
</p><br><p>This was an important fight, he couldn’t afford to lose because of some small thing.
</p><br><p>However... his opponent understood that very well. Your next chapter is on Freewebnovel
</p><br><p>A blue glow reflected in Fromund’s eyes. He slowly turned around only to see lightning bolts covering Adam’s body.
</p><br><p>The tips of his black hair became bright and white, rising and slowly swaying, eager to unleash its power on the first one who decided to challenge himself.</p>
