            <br><p>Katrin took a deep breath before running forward. She was heading towards the wounded Scarlet Pyromancer who was bleeding badly and couldn't escape.</p><br><p>In this condition, the Scarlet Pyromancer could do nothing to Katrin or even the weaker Phantom.</p><br><p>Adam who was standing beside Scarlet Pyromancer cast a serious glance at Katrin.</p><br><p>They glanced at each other as Adam immediately moved as far away from the monster as possible. The last attack was Katrin's, they had done everything right, so Katrin would definitely be able to get Scarlet Pyromancer's Initial Gene.</p><br><p>All she had left was to kill the monster, something she had been thinking about for a long time.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper tried to stay close to Fume Cathedral, but as soon as he dared to approach Katrin or Scarlet Pyromancer, Nessa immediately sped up.</p><br><p>'Fine, they're almost done. Nessa, you're doing a great job.' Refesa said calmly watching as Nessa's attacks got faster and faster.</p><br><p>She was doing her best to put pressure on Plague Reaper to keep him from getting closer to Fume Cathedral.</p><br><p>Her entire body ached, especially her hands, which had long since gone numb as her claws relentlessly slashed into the black blade and bone hilt. But, Nessa was adamant, she couldn't give up when Katrin almost got a new Initial Gene.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper, for the first time in the entire fight, nervously gulped. His eyes glanced more and more often at Katrin who was quickly running towards Scarlet Pyromancer lying on the ground.</p><br><p>Even if Scarlet Pyromancer tried to escape, he still wouldn't succeed, Katrin made sure that wouldn't happen. A multitude of roots covered Scarlet Pyromancer creating a spherical cage around him from which there was no escape.</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer was too weakened to burn Katrin's roots which flowed her saturated energy.</p><br><p>By this point, 2:30 of the five minutes had already passed, Katrin still had the same amount of time of the enhanced form, then 1:50 of the weakened stage and the last 10 seconds when the Evolution Tree would completely empty. But... Katrin didn't think about that anymore.</p><br><p>It was very obvious to her that she wouldn't need this dangerous time, since she was going to kill Scarlet Pyromancer.</p><br><p>Katrin had a few steps left to take, she clutched her staff tightly with her gaze fixed on Scarlet Pyromancer's head.</p><br><p>"KKKKKKRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRR!!!"</p><br><p>Suddenly, everyone heard an eerie screaming sounding as if an order was to stop.</p><br><p>Adam, Katrin, Nessa, and Osana stopped for a moment, they shuddered and a chill ran down their backs.</p><br><p>Katrin glanced to the side seeing Plague Reaper who was glaring furiously at her. Katrin only smirked as Nessa attacked him again.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper lunged forward, getting much closer to Katrin, but, after a few seconds, Nessa appeared in front of him.</p><br><p>"I won't let you stop her!" Nessa exclaimed, but this time she didn't attack him.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper got within an unsafe distance of Katrin. He was close enough to throw his scythe at her and kill her.</p><br><p>Thus, Nessa decided not to let that happen, gripping the bone hilt of his weapon tightly.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's hands were trembling, he tried to wrench his scythe from Nessa's iron grip, but it seemed Nessa was ready to lose her hands but would not weaken her grip.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Katrin raised her staff high, about to thrust it into Scarlet Pyromancer's head.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper flinched, his heart beating faster as he realized he didn't have any more time. He had to do something.</p><br><p>Then, he looked at Nessa, at her hands holding his scythe, and... his eyes grew deeper, filling with a dangerous darkness.</p><br><br><p>Katrin thrust her staff into the Scarlet Pyromancer's head, watching the trickles of blood rush out, taking with it the last bits of life lurking in the fiery monster.</p><br><p>A satisfied smirk appeared on Katrin's face as she stepped back, placed the staff in her left hand, and took a deep breath.</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer was already dead, but to obtain his Initial Gene, Katrin had to call the Revolve and absorb Scarlet Pyromancer's genes.</p><br><p>Her body trembled with excitement as her right hand came into motion.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Plague Reaper's face became as calm as ever as he serenely released his scythe.</p><br><p>Nessa watched wide-eyed as Plague Reaper jumped aside, leaving his weapon in her hands.</p><br><p>However... it was obvious from the look in his eyes that Plague Reaper had not given up. He had already made up his mind.</p><br><p>Katrin's hand rose to waist level as she opened her palm wide, about to call the Revolve. She didn't waste her time doing everything as quickly as possible.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper grabbed himself by the shoulder, tearing off his coat in a sudden movement.</p><br><p>His black eyes reflected a white flash that appeared in front of Katrin's palm, quickly becoming an active vortex - the Revolve.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper let out a long wheeze before tilting his body forward and throwing his coat directly at Katrin's side.</p><br><p>Adam, Osana, and Nessa watched Plague Reaper's actions with incomprehension in their eyes. Fear stirred in their hearts because of his calm expression, the unknown engulfing their minds with darkness.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer's body trembled, thin white streams of energy began to emerge from it, preparing to release this once-great monster's genes.</p><br><p>Clutch. Clutch. Clutch.</p><br><p>There was a strange sound from the side that resembled a rapidly closing jaw, like a wild piranha seeing its prey.</p><br><p>Enjoy new tales from empire</p><br><p>The Plague Reaper's coat shuddered rapidly turning into a blob of darkness, at the next heartbeat, a huge jaw emerged from it followed by a trail of black flame.</p><br><p>A bright red star came out of Scarlet Pyromancer's body, hovering above the body of its former owner for a while before heading towards Katrin, aiming to disappear into her Revolve.</p><br><br><p>A black flash swept before Katrin's admiring eyes, the huge jaw clenched tightly at once engulfing the entire Scarlet Pyromancer, a chunk of cold earth, the red star, and Katrin's right arm, easily tearing it away from her body.</p>
