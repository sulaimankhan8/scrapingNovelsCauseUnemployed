            <br><p>Everything went as Erik expected - Reinz and Adam managed to master the Full Energy Control in a week, six days to be exact.</p><br><p>Now they had time to rest, get used to their new powers, and prepare for their next journey: Reinz would go up to Heaven Island and Adam at the Lower Ring, a place where people like him were not welcome.</p><br><p>Even though Adam and Reinz passed Erik's exam, Adam couldn't get what he wanted. He wanted to fight against Erik, but even with the use of all his powers, he didn't last even one second. A repeat of the fight against Damien didn't happen.</p><br><br><p>In complete silence, he was floating amidst the darkness in his inner space.</p><br><p>The bright light from his Evolution Tree illuminated this almost empty area, but his eyes were blankly staring at a single point.</p><br><p>[And... What was that... Adam?]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree's menacing voice rumbled throughout the inner space. Lone Blaze and Moira, hiding in Adam's Initial Gene, shuddered in fear.</p><br><p>"Agh?" Adam looked lazily to the side, "What are you talking about...?'"</p><br><p>[Your attempt to attack Erik... Do you have any idea how much power that man has? You're lucky he didn't get angry... He could have crushed you like a bug just by using his aura...!]</p><br><p>Without showing any emotion, Adam muttered, "You're getting too nervous, he wouldn't kill me, that's for sure. I just wanted to see if I could get him to get even a little serious. If only for a split second..."</p><br><p>[I don't want to hear anything!]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree erupted in anger.</p><br><p>[When you fought against Damien, it was his suggestion, and he was holding back his power...! Erik is a Second Rank Phantom just like Damien, but... his aura always remained calm, he used his true strength for your exam!]</p><br><br><p>[What...? What are you talking about!!!]</p><br><p>Adam's eyes grew deeper as he swung his right leg pushing away from the darkness like he was floating on a river.</p><br><p>"Sure, Erik and Damien are both the Second Rank Phantoms, but... as Reinz said, even between the Second Rank Phantoms, there is a difference... only one step, but it exists. So... Erik is not as strong as Damien, that's for sure."</p><br><p>Oddly enough, the Evolution Tree didn't say anything else. It had nothing more to say to Adam, who saw his actions as no threat to himself.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Crystal Gates shuddered several times, wanting to get Adam's attention.</p><br><br><p>Adam slowly turned around, looking at the second orb waiting for Adam to do what he had to do.</p><br><p>"Right, I completely forgot about that. The Full Energy Control isn't a reward for opening gates like the Stellar Resonance, it's a way to get the reward."</p><br><br><p>In a few steps, Adam descended towards the gate, his fist tightly clenched, ready to crash down on the second orb.</p><br><p>His breathing and the rumble of the powerful Stellar Flow hitting the gates were the only sounds in the vast space.</p><br><p>"Well... This is my last reinforcement before going down."</p><br><p>In a flash, his fist slammed into the second orb. He realized he had to use the Outer Energy Control, so his fist was filled with energy.</p><br><p>To Adam's surprise, only half of the orb shattered - the other brightened into a non-physical object, the energy-dense in the cell.</p><br><p>"I see... That's why you need Infusive Energy Control. Well, good, I know what to do." he muttered.</p><br><p>A silver needle appeared in Adam's hand as he got into a fighting stance.</p><br><p>Thrust. Thrust. Thrust.</p><br><p>Three lightning bolts pierced the ether portion of the sphere, destabilizing its energy. In a silent burst, the orb shattered into shimmering fragments flying before Adam's eyes.</p><br><p>Without a moment's hesitation, the gate shattered into pieces, letting some of the Stellar Flow forward.</p><br><p>Seeing that Adam continued to stand carelessly in place, the Evolution Tree became worried:</p><br><p>[Adam! Get out of there! This energy is not for you! It could be dangerous!]</p><br><p>However, Adam continued to stand, allowing the flow to rush towards him. The Stellar Flow failed to knock him down, gradually descending to knee level like a normal river.</p><br><p>In the crystal clear energy resembling water, Adam saw his reflection.</p><br><p>Since he became a Phantom, a lot of things had changed, his worldview, his capabilities, he himself and also his goals.</p><br><p>"Wilfred and Aiden Henk... I'll deal with you first. I need to find out what their goals are." Adam clenched his fist tightly. "I don't know much about Wilfred, unlike Aiden, but... Does he just want the Citadel to have more of the Natural Phantoms?"</p><br><p>Something inside Adam didn't allow him to fully believe in that theory.</p><br><p>He was familiar with the two free scientists, Magnus and Refesa, he was sure that Aiden possessed the same intelligence and thinking or even surpassed those two in every way.</p><br><p>"I don't know what exactly he's doing, what his tasks ahead are, but... what he's done to me and is doing to others to create the Natural Phantoms... It's all too inefficient."</p><br><p>Adam gritted his teeth, there was no anger in his eyes, more disappointment that this was still a mystery to him. He only had guesses and assumptions; possibly he was close to the truth, maybe not, but Adam realized that he didn't know much.</p><br><p>"If his goal isn't to create a large number of the Natural Phantoms, then that leaves only one option - he's an insane sadist, but..." Adam smiled bitterly. "That option is even more stupid than the first."</p><br><p>After a short pause as the Stellar Flow reached the Evolution Tree, Adam looked up as if wanting to see Heaven Island.</p><br><p>"Anyway, I'll soon find out why Aiden is doing this. Maybe Wilfred will help me with that. It's the only thing I need the Lower Ring for.</p><br><br><p>His eyes grew colder, remembering Queen Elisa.</p><br><p>"I need to find out what's going on at the Citadel. A secret island and... a practically dead queen. That doesn't sound like good news at all."</p>
