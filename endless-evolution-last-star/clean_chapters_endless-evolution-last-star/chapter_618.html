            <br><p>Food, especially junk food was the greatest love of children and youths, their bodies were growing and demanding resources, any ones, and their taste preferences had not yet fully formed.</p><br><p>For Elva, Liv, and Tilda there was a real feast here, Trici had also joined them, she followed Fromund's sisters, she was interested in talking to them since they were older than her.</p><br><p>But... it wasn't long before they realized what a difference there was between ordinary humans and two hungry Phantoms.</p><br><p>After consuming several servings of the coveted food, the girls leaned back in their chairs, rubbing their full bellies.</p><br><p>Eager to know what their big brothers were doing, they turned around and their eyes went wide.</p><br><p>Adam and Fromund had been continuing to eat for a long time, with no intention of stopping. Beside each were towers of empty plates swaying from side to side.</p><br><p>"How delicious! It's certainly not restaurant-level, but... there's so much here! I'm afraid I won't have time to try everything interesting!" Fromund exclaimed, shoving a piece of meat into his mouth.</p><br><p>Bam. Experience tales at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>A fist came crashing down on the table, causing Fromund's eyes to dart to Adam.</p><br><p>"Do not relax! My hunger isn't even half satisfied! There's still a lot of work ahead!"</p><br><p>With his words, Adam took a large sip of soda before finishing off a massive slice of cheese pizza.</p><br><p>In response, Fromund only smirked, licking his fingertips.</p><br><p>"Hah, I wasn't going to stop. I calculate my strength rationally unlike you."</p><br><p>Apparently, Silvana, Arayna and Leona's plan failed. Once Adam and Fromund saw the mountain of food their minds desired after ten days of starvation, there was no way to stop them.</p><br><br><p>Silvana put her cup of tea aside, slowly rose from her seat, and headed for the exit.</p><br><p>"I'm going for a walk, don't be bored without me."</p><br><p>Arayna nodded deeply and Leona raised an eyebrow in confusion, her gaze following Silvana until she disappeared behind the door.</p><br><p>Then, Leona slowly turned to Arayna.</p><br><p>"So... You're the Operator of my son's adversary?"</p><br><p>Arayna gulped, for some reason, in her eyes Leona looked menacing and her voice seemed low and stern.</p><br><p>"Yeah... I am!" Arayna formally replied bouncing slightly on her chair.</p><br><p>Enjoying her reaction, Leona smiled slightly, shaking her head.</p><br><p>"You don't have to be afraid of me. I realize it's your job and..." Leona's eyes traveled to Fromund, who was sharing a meal along with her son, "I think Fromund deserves a decent Operator."</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Leona leaned back in her chair, looking up at the ceiling.</p><br><p>"I've had a hard time raising two children, though... I'm still in the process." Leona smiled bitterly, looking at Trici, who was actively participating in the conversation with Elva, Liv, and Tilda. The girls' ages differed by a few years, but they found common topics.</p><br><p>"Hah... Thanks, I guess. Fromund is trying, but he's got a lot of work to do to figure it all out."</p><br><p>Leona shrugged quietly, her arms crossed over her chest.</p><br><p>"Well, the Phantoms make a lot of money. As a mother of a Phantom, I'm lucky enough to experience that. I'm sure together you'll do fine. The important thing is..."</p><br><p>At that moment, Leona's look grew serious and her eyes darkened.</p><br><p>"Don't ever leave him, no matter the reasons. Strong people, they're very tough like diamonds, but... if something causes them to crack, to fracture, it will be very difficult to recover."</p><br><p>It made Arayna ponder, not that she was going to leave Fromund, he was a great Phantom for any Operator, but... Leona's words revealed to her how serious their situation was and could become unsustainable in an instant.</p><br><br><p>The door opened as Silvana stepped outside the medical department, heading towards the park by the building. On a wide bench, a girl with long pink hair sat lonely, just staring at one point with a blank gaze.</p><br><p>Without saying anything, Silvana sat down next to her, taking a sip of the hot chocolate that she had picked up on the way from the vending machine,</p><br><p>"Why did you leave? It's pretty fun inside, there's plenty to talk about with Arayna and Mrs. Leona."</p><br><p>There was no reply, Osana only let out a heavy sigh, not wanting to talk about anything. She didn't even know if she should have stayed here for even one more minute.</p><br><p>"I see... But, I won't leave you for nothing."</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply and slowly turned to Osana, her gaze was intense wanting to get inside Osana's head.</p><br><p>"Is this what you wanted? If Adam had said he wanted you to be his wife, then... would you do it?"</p><br><p>Then, as if her words had finally reached her ears, Osana rested her cheek on her hand, looking serenely at Silvana.</p><br><p>"Why do you ask? He's already made his decision."</p><br><br><p>Taking another sip, Silvana shrugged.</p><br><p>"Because I don't think you're going to stop. However, I'm not interested in what you do next. I want you to answer my question."</p><br><p>"Would I become his wife to his will, right?"</p><br><p>Osana nodded weakly, showing that the answer was obvious.</p><br><p>"Yes, I would quietly and obediently agree, inwardly rejoicing like a silly, naive girl, and... it would be wonderful."</p><br><p>"Not that I wanted that initially, but... Adam, he's not an obedient puppy, but he's not a cruel tyrant either. He knows what he wants and yet he doesn't demand anything of others. If I were to choose a husband, it would definitely be someone like that."</p><br><p>Taking a glance to the side, Osana finished:</p><br><p>"Someone you can rely on, who is free and doesn't feel like they're trying to control you or demand too much of your attention."</p><br><p>Silvana wanted to say something, but before the words could escape her lips, a tall silhouette towered in front of her, pink curls falling dangerously over her shoulders.</p><br><br><p>Osana whispered, their eyes staring at each other practically colliding foreheads.</p><br><p>"Unlike you, I would have the courage to confess my desires if he gave me the opportunity..."</p><br><p>Then, Osana turned around and quickly walked away, she stopped after a few meters glaring at Silvana over her shoulder.</p><br><p>Her gaze fell on Silvana's wrist, on her unusual bracelet.</p><br><p>"As far as I know you are the only woman he gave such a gift to. In my case, I was the one who gave him the ring. Pfffft! You're just a coward!"</p><br><p>Silvana gasped, she didn't know what to say watching Osana walk back into the main hall.</p>
