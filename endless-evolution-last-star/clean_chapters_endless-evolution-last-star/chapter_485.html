            <br><br><p>All Phantoms and people associated with Dead Lands had seen it, most of them in person. Almost the same was true for ordinary people.</p><br><p>Sure, not many ordinary people see energy in life, but through screens, on the news, or by watching some video, it is possible.</p><br><p>Those with deeper knowledge, Operators or military, knew that the energy was inside the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>True, the Initial Gene was the core, but it was the Evolution Tree that held all of the Phantom's energy.</p><br><p>As the Phantom grew stronger, its Evolution Tree grew, becoming a more complex and massive structure.</p><br><p>Regardless, when it came to K2-Phantoms and below, almost none of them knew what was inside the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>More precisely... it was similar to the situation with the planet. People knew that inside was a core of molten metals held together by gravity, but no one had ever seen it with their own eyes.</p><br><p>The same thing was happening to the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>The Phantoms, and not only them, understood and knew that there was energy inside, it was logical, as every fiber of the Evolution Tree was saturated with energy, even the furthest part of it.</p><br><p>But, to be inside the Evolution Tree, especially the way Adam did it, there were very few K2-Phantoms that went through such a situation.</p><br><p>It wasn't surprising, though, since even Dahla didn't know that it was a good thing that it had taken Adam so long.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, seeing the Two Walls in the distance. There was nothing but bright, white light, pure and untainted.</p><br><p>Two semi-transparent walls floated inside as if made of solid white crystal. Adam could see through the walls, but the image was not as clear as through glass or ice, it was slightly cloudy.</p><br><p>The edges of the walls were sharp and straight, there was not a single smooth or rounded spot, showing their firmness and rigor.</p><br><p>The distance between the Two Walls was only a few meters, which was insignificant considering their size.</p><br><p>Each wall was taller and wider than Adam several times, presenting before him like impenetrable barriers that he was not destined to pass through.</p><br><p>In front of, behind, and between the Two Walls, everywhere there were occasional thick streams of energy tending upwards.</p><br><p>It was like the blood that moved inside the human body, an engine that kept a human alive every second of his life.</p><br><p>All this energy belonged to Adam, it allowed him to fight against monsters and survive in deadly battles.</p><br><p>Adam gulped as he took a step forward. He didn't know why, but he was a little nervous.</p><br><p>Things had been easier in some ways before. He needed genes, artifacts, essences, and something rarer like the Midnight Crystal.</p><br><p>Even in the beginning, he needed to defeat a special monster that his Evolution Tree had chosen, then it was the Crown Type monster - the Brass Puppet.</p><br><p>But... it was all somewhat understandable and achievable.</p><br><p>This was what Dahla was talking about, anyone could gather enough resources, and defeating a special monster could be done by most Phantoms with enough training and patience.</p><br><br><p>Adam touched the edge of the trunk about to go inside to face the Two Walls finally.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, energy streams turned into thick ribbons that in a few breaths completely covered the passage.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam was puzzled, he blinked a few times, then a realization came to him.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree had moved into action as well. If it had ignored Adam before, now, it was preventing him from reaching his goal.</p><br><p>"What the fuck...? Hey, it's one thing to ignore me, but I've already gone too far! I'm not going to fight you!" Your journey continues at empire</p><br><p>Adam gritted his teeth as he clenched his fists tightly.</p><br><p>Despite his words, the Evolution Tree wasn't going to stop. The ribbons continued to emerge from the energy, closing the passage to the Two Walls more and more tightly, the passage Adam had made with his fists through vivid pain.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide when he heard his Evolution Tree for the first time in a long time. It had finally decided to speak to him.</p><br><p>"Why? Why did you decide to start talking only now when it's too late!!! Fuck, I spent fifty minutes practically begging you to say one word to me!"</p><br><p>But, Adam didn't get answers to his questions. The Evolution Tree was pursuing its own goals, and the Evolution Tree could only have one goal - the well-being of its Phantom.</p><br><p>[If you go any further now... it may become too difficult... I don't... I don't... I don't control the walls... It...</p><br><p>They depend on you... Go away...].</p><br><p>Adam was annoyed but did not rush, though he should do so.</p><br><p>Every second, the passage closed with more and more ribbons made of his energy, now controlled by the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>"I see... It seems like as with new abilities, the new challenges are also related to my previous experiences."</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree only let out a strange grunt like some old man or a disgruntled ancient beast.</p><br><p>That brought a sly smile to Adam's face.</p><br><p>"Oh, looks like I'm right. But, hey, you know I can't hesitate, right? After practice, it's straight to the wedding day, until then, no events will happen that will change my Two Walls."</p><br><p>Adam said seriously, as he took a step forward.</p><br><p>"Let me through. I can handle the challenge. Furthermore, even if future events in my life can somehow ease the Two Walls, given the places I'm fighting in, it will be something insignificant." Adam shrugged.</p><br><p>He tried to act calm and serene as if he were talking to his good friend.</p><br><p>But... his time was running out. The streams of energy coming out of his body were already like waves, and he felt a slight weakness that was growing worse.</p><br><p>[No... If you want to pass... do it by force... Make a decision... like I did...] Adam smiled bitterly. It seemed that this was the response he expected.</p><br><p>"Well, no hard feelings then, okay?" Adam shrugged before clenching his fist tightly and attacking the wall of hundreds of white ribbons with all his might.</p><br><p>By then, it had been five minutes since Beth had set the timer.</p>
