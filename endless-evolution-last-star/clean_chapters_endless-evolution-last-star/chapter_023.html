            <h4>Chapter 23: Nexus and Soul Cry</h4><br><p>Women were marvelous creatures, while absolutely terrifying in anger. But, that wasn't nearly as meaningful as two girls trying their best to prove that someone was worse, especially if they were Operators before their Phantoms. </p><br><p>The table they were sitting at had already become the main center of attention for all the visitors. No one dared to disturb them but continued to watch as spectators of the unfolding story. </p><br><p>Adam and Oren had already made their peace with the situation an hour ago. They ordered cocktails, and enjoying them with tubes in their mouths, waited for the end of this epic battle. </p><br><p>"Fine. Based on all the data you've provided, I recognize that this mission was chosen under acceptable conditions." Silvana said calmly before waving her hand, removing the holographic documents, hovering above the tablet. </p><br><p>"Hah, just admit already that I did a great job!" Zola exclaimed energetically, crossing her arms over her chest. </p><br><p>"Are you done?" Adam asked, "When do we leave for the mission?" </p><br><p>"Yeah, I was wondering the same thing. More importantly, who won?" Oren joined in. </p><br><p>"Tomorrow, but none of us have won, yet!" Silvana narrowed her eyes. </p><br><p>Zola replied in the same way. </p><br><p>"Oren, I don't want to keep you, we need a few more minutes, you'd probably be better off walking." </p><br><p>Adam and Oren looked at each other, shrugged, and left the cafe together. They passed each other a few phrases on the way. </p><br><p>Then, Silvana and Zola's faces changed completely. They no longer looked like they were ready to tear each other apart, instead, they smiled. </p><br><p>"Hah, I told you this would work." Zola said confidently, placing her feet up on the table. Next to Oren, she would never do such a thing. </p><br><p>Silvana smirked, "Yeah, getting in touch and coming up with a plan before they met was a good idea." </p><br><p>Zola nodded, "After all, we are women first and foremost, and only then Operators. If there were to remain a conflict between these two it could affect the mission, there's no way we can let that happen." </p><br><p>"Sure, but you've actually had a few mistakes." A sharp glint passed between Silvana's eyes. </p><br><p>"Oh, come on." Zola leaned her elbows on the table while a dangerous grimace spread across her face. </p><br><br><p>Only ten minutes later, Silvana and Zola walked out of the café. </p><br><p>"Hey, I hope we don't have to wait any longer for you?" Oren asked, waving at them. </p><br><p>"Of course not!" Zola quickly replied, standing up next to Oren, "You're going on a mission tomorrow, at lunchtime." </p><br><p>"What about the Harvesters?" Oren glanced at her. Zola just pointed at Silvana. </p><br><p>"Adam, if you don't mind we'll take Felix and Verna on the mission again." </p><br><p>"Sure. Everything was fine until the Stone Goliaths showed up, hopefully, nothing like that will happen this time." Adam sighed heavily. </p><br><p>"Fine, in that case, see you later! I'm sure it will be an exciting mission! What's more, we'll be well paid for it! Bye!" Oren vigorously said, walking away along with Zola. </p><br><p>Before disappearing around the corner, Zola turned around one last time and showed Silvana her tongue without Oren seeing it. </p><br><p>Silvana frowned, clenching her fists. </p><br><p>"Is everything okay?" Adam raised an eyebrow. </p><br><p>"Yes, sorry." Silvana nodded. </p><br><p>"I think we should take your Nexus and study the mission ahead. The Golden Searchers are not the easiest of opponents. Moreover, there will definitely be someone from the Green Threat Level among them since it's V2." </p><br><p>"Sure, let's do it!" Adam exclaimed, full of enthusiasm. </p><br><br><p>The massive door opened, Adam and Silvana entered the Inferno Forge where Orin was already waiting for them. </p><br><p>"Hello, handsome!" Orin exclaimed in her characteristic manner. </p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head, slightly embarrassed and puzzled. Orin was acting a little too assertive, but Adam couldn't say he didn't like it. After all, it was hard to find someone who didn't like sincere compliments. </p><br><p>"Mrs. Orin, is everything ready?" Silvana asked sternly. </p><br><p>"Sure! The result is just as you wanted! Even better!" </p><br><p>Once in the room with the pod, Orin and Silvana stepped aside, making way for Adam. He slowly stepped forward until he stopped a meter away from the pod, wide-eyed as he watched his Nexus floating in the pale green liquid. </p><br><p>It was a pair of gloves, black with tiny plates covering them like scales on majestic dragons. Metal inserts protected vulnerable places, creating a contrast between white and black, but that wasn't what made them Nexus. </p><br><p>Above, from the wrist, a silver thread ran along each finger, stretched to the limit like a string on a violin, strong and sharp. </p><br><p>Orin smiled, pressed a button, and all the liquid went down quickly, emptying the pod. Then, a mechanical platform caught the falling gloves and offered them in front of Adam. </p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam put the gloves on, but the expected shock did not occur. He didn't feel that they were anything special, though he could feel a strange energy emanating from the threads. </p><br><p>"I understand your confusion." Orin nodded, "There's nothing strange about it since you need to activate them." </p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam gave her a questioning look. </p><br><p>"Each Nexus can only use a certain Phantom because the Initial Genes must match. Just concentrate and let your Nexus know that you are not a stranger but its master, a parent if you will." Orin explained. </p><br><p>Adam nodded and did as she said. His Evolution Tree trembled slightly as well as Initial Gene, then his eyes flashed, and a direct signal headed for his gloves. </p><br><p>In a heartbeat, several needles hidden inside the gloves pierced his wrist, but not a single drop of blood spilled, for they were all absorbed. </p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam's mind traveled to the Evolution Tree where something began to happen. </p><br><p>Next to his Evolution Tree, an exact replica of the gloves appeared in front of the artifact. </p><br><br><p>The gloves are ideal for one who is used to working with a needle, providing excellent protection for the weaver's hands and increasing the overall strength and speed of the needle through the connection of the threads into a single intertwining system. </p><br><p>First Trait - First Melody: Soul Cry] </p><br><p>Adam quickly read the description of First Trait, and his eyes shone brightly. </p><br><p>Then, he, with an excited smile, looked at his gloved hand, turning the backs of his palms towards each other and slowly bringing them closer together. </p><br><p>Orin's eyes went wide when she realized what Adam was about to do. </p><br><p>She waved her hand and exclaimed, "No! Not here! In the arena!" </p><br><p>However, Adam didn't hear her anymore, all his attention was focused on wanting to see what his Nexus was capable of. </p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble. </p><br><p>The silver threads clashed together, and when Adam swung his arms up and down sharply, like a musician drawing his violin bow across the strained strings of a violin. </p><br><p>A pleasant melody spread around, sending ripples through the air, but that was only for Adam. </p><br><p>For the others, it was a horrible scream as if from a mad siren, making the mind and soul of everyone who heard it hurt like from a hundred piercing blades. </p><br><p>All electronics shut down, monitors went out, and lights shattered. </p><br><p>Only after a few seconds, Adam turned around and saw Orin and Silvana with blood dripping from their ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. It seemed like a little more, and their heads would explode, but thankfully the effect of the melody soon wore off. </p><br><p>"Fuck... that was painful... but beautiful at the same time... That's one of the best Nexuses I've ever seen..." Orin wheezed before passing out as well as Silvana who glanced at Adam. </p><br><p>She wasn't mad at him, she was just sorry for what happened, with a slight sadness.</p>
