            <br><p>The mechanical robo-arm lifted the chamber, dropping it onto the center of the hatch with a clatter. The commander looked at Adam and nodded deeply - everything was ready.</p><br><p>With confident steps, Adam headed towards the steel chamber. Before stepping inside, he turned around, intending to call Silvana.</p><br><p>She smiled, about to step forward.</p><br><p>Suddenly, Erik's hand fell on her shoulder with enough force that she was afraid to even move.</p><br><p>"Not so fast," Erik smirked coldly.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam was puzzled. "What the fuck is going on here?"</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam's aura intensified, violently lashing out at Erik and the three men. Two of them immediately collapsed to one knee breathing heavily, but the commander continued to stand calmly with his hands behind his back.</p><br><p>"Adam, I didn't want to upset you prematurely, but you will have to go to the Lower Ring alone. Without your Operator." Erik shrugged, his hand like a snake traveling along Silvana's chest, preventing her from twitching.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana looked at each other. She was just as shocked as he was, but Adam didn't move to drastic methods ahead of time.</p><br><br><p>"Well..." Erik slowly released Silvana. "It's all about her safety. Usually, when you fight it takes place either in the arena or at the Dead Lands. In both cases, Silvana has a safe place from where she can watch and be away from the fight. After all, she's an Operator, not a fighter.</p><br><br><p>His crimson eyes grew darker.</p><br><p>"Where will Silvana hide at the Lower Ring? She doesn't have a home there or the connections to keep her safe."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes narrowed. He understood what Erik was talking about, but he didn't like where Erik was going with this at all.</p><br><p>"Oh, I see by the look in your eyes that you think you can protect her? You are strong, it's true, but Silvana is not as powerful as you are. If you get in trouble, you will have to protect Silvana, you will have to think about her safety, not about your opponent and victory. Sooner or later, that will lead to you either being beaten or killed and Silvana being kidnapped."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment.</p><br><p>Erik was right. Adam hadn't yet found himself in a situation where he needed to protect someone in the middle of a battle, because when he was at the Dead Lands, Silvana was tens of kilometers away - behind the walls of the Citadel.</p><br><p>"What are you talking about?" he asked. "Why would anyone want to kidnap Silvana?"</p><br><p>A sly smirk passed across Erik's face, instilling even greater fear in the men than Adam's aura.</p><br><p>"Because the attitudes towards Operators at the Lower Ring and the Upper Ring are very different. A beautiful, elegant, and experienced Operator like Silvana is not a person but a valuable commodity. And... the fact that she's from the Upper Ring makes her a true treasure."</p><br><p>Silvana turned pale. She was horrified to hear such words spoken to her, but... there was no hatred for Erik in her eyes, only fear.</p><br><p>Adam was in a similar situation.</p><br><p>He realized that Erik wasn't trying to insult Silvana or belittle her - he was saying the way things were at the Lower Ring. And, it disturbed Adam, who had never been to that place.</p><br><p>'Shit... maybe I should listen to him. It seems Erik is not only well-informed due to his position but has visited the Lower Ring quite a few times.'</p><br><p>Adam bit his lip, he had a decision to make.</p><br><p>Could he do so without Silvana's opinion?</p><br><p>"What do you think?" Adam looked at her.</p><br><p>Silvana smiled weakly as she pressed her palm to her chest. "I will do as you say. If you want us to go together then I will follow you as well as any Operator. About Mr. Erik's words... I don't think he's lying. It doesn't make sense."</p><br><p>Erik shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>However, Adam didn't look at him instead he turned to the commander.</p><br><p>"At the Lower Ring are there many people who are stronger than me? Is it hard for Operators to live there?"</p><br><p>"Khm..." The commander raised his chin. "Sure, K3-Phantom is far from being the strongest fighter at the Lower Ring. It's a different life there, almost another world - many things are not the same as at the Lower Ring, whether it's the everyday life of ordinary people, trade, Phantoms, or the position of Operators."</p><br><p>"What a slippery answer..." Adam snorted, and then he shook his head.</p><br><p>His aura returned to normal as he stepped forward.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, he found himself in front of Silvana, kissing her deeply as if they would never see each other again. He held her tightly against him and Silvana responded in kind.</p><br><p>"Well, well... Youths are always so sensitive." Erik chuckled briefly standing a few steps behind.</p><br><p>Once their lips parted Adam looked intently into her eyes.</p><br><p>"Your safety is paramount. Consider my departure at the Lower Ring as just another mission at the Dead Lands."</p><br><p>Blushing slightly Silvana nodded. "Yeah... Either way, I'll be with you."</p><br><p>Erik stepped forward, towering over them.</p><br><p>"Unfortunately you won't even have that."</p><br><p>They turned to him simultaneously, baffled.</p><br><br><p>Erik's hand transformed into a shadow, deftly grabbing Adam's NEP that was always on his wrist.</p><br><p>"Hey! What the hell are you doing? Can you explain first!" he clenched his fists tightly.</p><br><p>"Hehehehe," he smirked. "I'm sorry, it's just so funny when you're mad. The point is, at the Lower Ring, you won't need this thing."</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Erik clenched his fist, destroying Adam's NEP into metal scraps. When he unclenched his fist, a piece of trash fell to the ground.</p><br><p>"But, don't worry. You're a Phantom and every Phantom has its own NEP. However, you're now a Phantom from the Lower Ring, so... your NEP should be appropriate," Erik slipped his hand under his coat, pulling out a black NEP.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils dilated. It was the exact same one he saw on the Dark Phantoms he'd been unlucky enough to fight against.</p><br><p>"This is pure NEP. So you don't belong to any of the four major organizations at the Lower Ring."</p><br><p>In a deft move, Erik slipped the NEP onto Adam's wrist and with a clap on the back sent him off to the side of the chamber.</p><br><p>"This has both disadvantages and advantages. How you use it is up to you."</p>
