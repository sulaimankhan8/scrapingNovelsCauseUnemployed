            <h4>Chapter 1049: Black Impulse (Part 1)</h4><br><p>Somewhere in the Pacific Lands, in the territory for the Blue and Purple Threat monsters, a squad of Phantoms fought against the monsters next to a massive rock, its sharp peaks peering upward.
</p><br><p>The situation was uncertain.
</p><br><p>Some of them were wounded, and so were the monsters. But, there was still time before backup would arrive.
</p><br><p>Their frowning faces showed that many were in agreement that they wouldn’t be able to hold out long enough.
</p><br><p>"Don’t lose your spirit!" A man with broad shoulders exclaimed, fighting off the first of dozens of monsters coming at them. "There may be more of them, but we’re stronger! We can buy enough time!"
</p><br><p>Whether he believed what he was saying or not was unknown, it didn’t matter. A leader wasn’t supposed to let others lose faith in victory.
</p><br><p>’Damn it!’ he swung his sword. ’It takes another ten minutes for the fighters to get here. That’s too long... We need something faster than that!’
</p><br><p>Then, someone exclaimed:
</p><br><p>"Look! Something’s moving in our direction!"
</p><br><p>Everyone turned around, seeing a tiny black dot in the distance. Gradually, it grew bigger and bigger, leaving behind the ring-shaped pulses as it surged at tremendous speeds.
</p><br><p>Before anyone had time to react, in just a few seconds, the dot turned into a flash, which was like lightning through a pack of monsters.
</p><br><p>The shockwave tore the monsters apart as torrents of wind rained down on the Phantoms, knocking some of them down.
</p><br><p>"What the...?" the man gulped, slowly turning his head.
</p><br><p>All that was left in place of the monsters was a bloody stain and a deep as a tunnel trail leading towards the black impulse.
</p><br><p>No one knew or realized what had just happened, but one girl flinched. She couldn’t help it, but she was convinced that for a split second, she saw the outline of a man with a wide, devious grin.
</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.
</p><br><p>This sort of thing went on for long stretches. Every time the black impulse collided with the monsters, there was nothing but scattered pieces of flesh in their place. It wasn’t just the speed and strength, but the aura working at full force in a small radius around Gladius.
</p><br><p>He just wanted to kill such weak monsters.
</p><br><p>However, aside from the aura, Gladius also did not hold back his speed. Wherever he passed, he left craters and destruction behind him like a force of nature.
</p><br><p>For some Phantoms, this became salvation, though that was not Gladius’s goal. He just wanted to get to the Dark Shore as fast as possible. In such a matter, he couldn’t rely on fighters or another method that required preparation.
</p><br><p>But he always had his legs and energy. For such rare occasions, that was enough.
</p><br><p>’Come on, Adam Vinter. Don’t you dare die too quickly. Moreover, though Aiden doesn’t show it, I’m sure he will be upset at such a loss. After all, of all the candidates, you’re the most promising!’
</p><br><p>It was unknown when Gladius would be able to reach the Dark Shore, or rather, the place where Adam was. Even with the information he had, he knew too little to know where Adam stood.
</p><br><br><br><p>With a splash of blood, next to a colossal sized crimson waterfall flowing deep down, a girl with black hair and blood red eyes emerged from the portal.
</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..." Her heavy breathing was unusual for a strong regenerative monster like her.
</p><br><p>Even though she might have recovered from the blast, her body still bore visible red streaks from Adam’s recent needle cuts.
</p><br><p>It would take Rosana some time to fully recover, but that wasn’t what bothered her.
</p><br><p>They had used their trump card and fled the battlefield in disgrace. She would have to explain herself to someone looking out for her as a young talent.
</p><br><p>Slowly, she raised her head hearing the sound of a familiar waterfall. She saw the raging river passing amongst stone peaks and great trees remotely similar to those at the blood pond, but more majestic.
</p><br><p>Many branches ran down, filling the ground along with great roots protruding from the surface.
</p><br><p>Blood veins ran alongside the roots, weaving together and heading towards the river and the small lakes lurking below.
</p><br><p>Among the trees one could see buildings of dark stone and several absurdly large skulls of long dead monsters. The greatest of them were partially broken, roots covering them with quivering, bloody veins.
</p><br><p>Soon, her arrival was noticed, but only one person had to waste his time on her.
</p><br><br><p>From outside came quiet footsteps from a tall, thin man, perhaps too thin, for his ribs were visible beneath his gray skin under his spacious black and red robe. His dark eyes were deeply set and his aura far surpassed Rosana’s.
</p><br><p>"Rosana... My favorite disciple. What made you use the last resort and come here at the Sacrificial Waterfalls?" the man asked, his low voice booming like frightening thunder.
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Rosana forgot about the pain and about Adam as she dropped to one knee in front of the man.
</p><br><p>"Elder Osmer... I traveled to the human lands, I hoped to find a worthy opponent and gather essences... I wanted to become stronger!"
</p><br><p>Her voice trembled, but not from fear but from disappointment in herself that she had failed to do so.
</p><br><p>It was obvious to Osmer, both in her aura and the fact that she had to run, back to her hideout at the Dark Shore, where she was welcome at any moment.
</p><br><p>"I see... You ran into too strong a Phantom, didn’t you?" Osmer asked.
</p><br><p>There was no anger in him, only interest.
</p><br><p>"Who was it, a K4-Phantom? Maybe you spotted a Second Rank Phantom from afar and decided to run away before it was too late?"
</p><br><p>Rosana bit her lip, afraid to answer.
</p><br><p>"No... It was a K3-Phantom... Adam... His name is Adam..."
</p><br><p>Rosana knew this since she accepted Adam’s challenge to fight sparks. She only knew the name, nothing else. Now, she would remember it for a long time and would wait for the moment to take revenge on this Phantom.</p>
