            <br><p>Each Phantom and the External Artifact's relationship developed differently. Lone Blaze was looking for a strong warrior to protect her from an impending threat that ended up being the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>She made a pact with Adam and took her tasks seriously. To her, Adam was a master, and she was willing to obey all his orders and carry them out.</p><br><p>Obviously, there was a very different dynamic between Risha and Radiant Mirage. They were equals or even Radiant Mirage took the lead when communicating.</p><br><p>However, it was clear to everyone that the External Artifact depended on Phantom much more. Radiant Mirage had abandoned his inner space and soon his physical form, the star-crystal would collapse with no more meaning.</p><br><p>The only place he could feel at home now was Risha's inner space and especially her Initial Gene.</p><br><p>"Wait..." Risha muttered, barely concealing her growing joy. "I'm getting a new ability? From you? Right now?"</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage shook his head. "Yeah, something like that. Don't make such a stupid face! It annoys me!"</p><br><p>In response, Risha only smiled even more, teasing him.</p><br><p>"Argh! Moreover, it's not quite like that!" Radiant Mirage stomped through the darkness. "I'm not replacing your ability, I'm supplementing your Initial Gene. My essence and yours will combine to create something new and powerful!"</p><br><p>Risha tilted her head, touching her lips together. "Do you need any help? Do you know what my Initial Order is?"</p><br><p>"Of course I am," Radiant Mirage nodded deeply. "It's kind of like a battle mode, right? You've got all your abilities tied to wild beast power to some degree or another."</p><br><p>After a few moments, Risha nodded.</p><br><br><p>Radiant Mirage thoughtfully muttered, looking at Risha's Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>"Well, I can't make you stronger, and giving you magical abilities won't be effective. Given your fighting style and the Initial Gene, you simply won't have the ability to use beams or light projectiles."</p><br><p>Then, he turned to Risha, running a bottom-up glance over her.</p><br><p>"Well, why don't you stop being quiet and waiting for me to do everything? What do you want for yourself? I'm ready to hear your opinion and tell you what I can give you and what I can't."</p><br><p>Risha seemed to have been waiting for those words. Her eyes lit up with bright flames as she walked over pointing to her Initial Gene.</p><br><p>"Oh, yeah, I have an idea!"</p><br><br><p>About an hour after RIsha's awakening, she opened her eyes again, this time returning not from sleep but from her inner space.</p><br><p>For a moment, a shadow ran across her eyes, reminding her of her new, loyal ally.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, calm, confident footsteps sounded from the entrance.</p><br><p>Risha turned around to see Adam holding a meat bun and some kind of drink in a clay flask.</p><br><p>He hadn't left the resistance caves, so this food was what the serpents ate, the ones that preferred to stay in a human form.</p><br><p>It also meant that the meat in the bun was not from animals but from monsters, though that didn't bother Adam too much. He didn't care who or what the food was made of, as long as it tasted good.</p><br><p>He walked forward and chewed with a carefree expression, obviously thinking about something.</p><br><p>Sure, he knew that Risha was here, at the Magma Plateau. Heret and the others had brought her here to be closer to the Radiant Mirage and the dense energy, it was good for her recovery.</p><br><p>'Hmm...' Risha internally hummed. 'I woke up a while ago, he couldn't have known about it. Moreover, first of all, the serpents who treated me would have come to me to check if I was alright. Adam... He's busy with other things, and this is my chance to strike him!'</p><br><p>All that drove Risha was the desire to use his new ability and inflict some decent attacks on Adam!</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage already knew what she wanted to do.</p><br><p>"Damn..." he shook his head. "You should have rested a bit more, but... Hah, I won't deny that I want to punch him in the face too!"</p><br><p>Then, Radiant Mirage turned into a bright star disappearing into Risha's Initial Gene. The red orb was partially illuminated by a white light, powerful and active.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Risha's eyes flashed as streams of energy traveled to her feet.</p><br><p>In some ways, all External Artifact abilities were similar. Their purpose was to supplement their Phantom's order and turn energy into something real, even if only temporarily.</p><br><p>Soon, high boots made of hundreds of broken mirror fragments covered Risha's legs up to her knees. Well, the fragments weren't connected, lines ran between them like cracks, but they accounted for Risha's every movement while maintaining a unified structure.</p><br><p>This was Radiant Mirage's part. Then, red energy ran through Risha's body, but she was no longer transformed into a beast with long fangs. Her muscles tensed, and her gaze changed, becoming sharper.</p><br><br><p>Risha tore forward, cutting through the wind currents. Behind her remained ghostly copies as her leap shattered the crystal into pieces.</p><br><p>What Risha asked of Radiant Mirage was not strength or light beam, but speed. Radiant Mirage was easily able to fulfill her request by augmenting it with his mirror abilities.</p><br><p>Now, Risha was not only much faster, but she could also create her own mirages. This increased her survivability, making it much harder for opponents to spot her.</p><br><p>'Yes! He still didn't notice me!' Risha exclaimed internally as she approached Adam at a dangerous distance. 'Hah, he didn't expect my attack, but that's not my problem! A warrior should always be ready for anything!'</p><br><p>Energy headed towards her arm, transforming into three scarlet claws as she was ready to slash Adam's shoulder.</p><br><br><p>Still left in unawareness, Adam shoved the bun halfway into his mouth, freeing his right hand.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Risha's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>The next thing she saw was the glint from several threads streaking behind Adam.</p><br><p>Then, the threads tied around her ankle as Adam jerked his hand, slamming Risha into the nearest wall with a deafening thud.</p>
