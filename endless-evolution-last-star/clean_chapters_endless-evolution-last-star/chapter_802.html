            <br><p>Two sharp blades pierced the Crimson Monarch's torso. Bright, hot pain rippled through his body. He could feel the blades cutting into his flesh, blood coating the black edges.</p><br><p>Wounds of this magnitude had long since ceased to mean anything to the Crimson Monarch. It wasn't just about regeneration, like any experienced fighter, he wouldn't scream from something like this.</p><br><br><p>Taking advantage of his brief weakness, Adam tore forward, plunging his fist into the Crimson Monarch's stomach.</p><br><p>The impact took him off the dark blades, throwing him back several meters. Adam hadn't been able to do that earlier, but now the Crimson Monarch lost his balance and firm grip on the ground.</p><br><p>Yet, even in this situation, he naturally found himself on his feet, a few meters away from the two Phantoms.</p><br><p>The deep cuts on his stomach were quickly healing right before their eyes, the Crimson Monarch paid no attention to it. His natural regeneration healed countless wounds over his long journey.</p><br><p>Slowly, he raised his hands looking at the bloody palms.</p><br><p>"Not bad..." he raised his gaze, looking at Katrin, who was moving to madness at her helplessness. " It looks like you're finally using at least some of what your gear is capable of."</p><br><p>After a few seconds, when his wounds had already healed, the Crimson Monarch stared at Adam, subsequently transferring his eyes to Katrin.</p><br><p>"You, young lady, are infinitely far from him, but... I can congratulate you. You've taken the first step."</p><br><br><p>As if not listening to him, Katrin tore forward. Her eyes were empty, the wild desire to finally win - to become stronger, consumed her like an abyss.</p><br><p>In an endless stream, memories of defeats and failures filled her mind. This never happened to her before, her patience was at an end - she couldn't take it anymore.</p><br><p>Gritting her teeth like a wild beast, clutching her swords tightly to her skin, she ran forward intending to give it her best.</p><br><p>Either she would get stronger now and finally be able to get rid of her limit, or this would be the end of her journey.</p><br><br><p>Sure, it wasn't just reckless, it was stupid and deadly dangerous. But... wasn't that what Adam was doing all along the way?</p><br><p>While Katrin was afraid to go too far, wanting to make her way gradually, mission after mission, one rock after another, Adamin, in one sudden leap, created a path in a completely unexpected place and it was much deeper and longer than Katrin's.</p><br><p>In a very long time, this was Katrin's first rash decision, because she made it not following logic or calculations, but her instincts and more importantly her sheer desires.</p><br><br><p>Two swords swept over the Crimson Monarch's face, he dodged at the last moment.</p><br><p>His eyes reflected her frantic stare, ready to go for anything.</p><br><p>"Right, this is what you need..."</p><br><p>Twitch. Twitch. Twitch.</p><br><p>His wing shuddered, it was no longer capable of lifting him into the air, at least until it was fully healed, but the main, sturdy part with the three claws remained in its original form.</p><br><p>"Too bad you made your move minutes before your death. Well, you shouldn't blame fate for that, you had the opportunity, you just didn't take it."</p><br><p>In a sharp sweep, the wing slammed into Katrin, sharp claws sinking into her skin, letting trickles of blood flow. Several muscles in her face twitched in vivid pain, but she was ready to keep fighting.</p><br><p>Yet, the wing didn't finish its movement. A quick pulse threw Katrin aside. She crashed into a clod of snow, rolling across the ground in an uncontrollable spin.</p><br><p>Without relinquishing his words, the Crimson Monarch stretched his arm forward, gathering energy for a devastating shot.</p><br><p>Before the lighting ray could escape from the orb, someone's hand pulled the Crimson Monarch's wrist to the side.</p><br><br><p>The lighting ray collapsed next to Katrin, it was unknown how much damage she took.</p><br><p>Without a hint of surprise, the Crimson Monarch turned her head to the left, meeting Adam's cold gaze.</p><br><p>"Why? You're protecting her, even though you could have attacked her instead. She's a burden, she won't be as strong as you."</p><br><p>"Well..." Adam gripped the Crimson Monarch's wrist tighter, "I'm fighting against you. If she can accomplish something then fine, if not... It doesn't matter. In the end - I'll be the one to kill you."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch nodded slightly as if pondering his words.</p><br><p>"What a strange situation. We're on unequal terms, and it's not about that there are two of you."</p><br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch touched Adam's chest, his movement carried no threat so Adam's instincts didn't react.</p><br><p>"Your goal is to kill me, while mine is to capture you. An advanced challenge, but it's worth it. In the end, neither you nor this human woman will see victory."</p><br><p>Adam's corners of his lips lifted upward, he could feel a powerful aura growing behind him. Katrin, with trembling legs, slowly rose from the ground.</p><br><br><p>Blood ran down along her right arm, the ray blast had grazed her shoulder, tearing her flesh, in her current state, she didn't even bother to pay attention to it.</p><br><p>Adam jerked his head back as Katrin turned into a shadow.</p><br><p>"You see? It's been a long time since I met an opponent who got me to this state, but this is the first time she's had it."</p><br><p>Before the Crimson Monarch could respond, two broad swings left deep cuts on his back.</p><br><p>Adam didn't hesitate, his fists slammed into the Crimson Monarch's chest, with all the force and speed he could muster.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch could not ignore the pain, as well as, lost his dignity.</p><br><p>These two were no match for him, and he was determined to prove it.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, a massive dark jaw engulfed his right arm, about to devour it at the elbow. At the same moment, purple streams covered Adam's left fist, intending to bring down a second gravity punch.</p><br><p>"Tsk. Teamwork, right?"</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch ran his gaze over them, ignoring the blades slashing at his back.</p><br><p>"Not bad, really not bad, but not enough..."</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Electric shocks traveled through the Crimson Monarch's body. The power of the lightning quickly accumulated into a dense shell, expanding from the Crimson Monarch into a quivering sphere.</p><br><p>Adam and Katrin realized too late that it was nothing short of an energy blast.</p><br><p>With a shockwave, the two figures flew off to the side. One quickly regained its balance, sliding across the surface, leaving black streaks on the gray earth. The second was not as successful, but in a sudden movement was able to get up as well.</p><br><p>Particles of fire streaked before Adam's deep eyes, his arms crossed in a block. The flame bracelets absorbed most of the damage, yet the burns on his shoulders and knees showed that some of the electric shocks reached their target.</p><br><br><p>Katrin dropped to one knee, thrusting her sword into the ground for support. She could fight on, she would do so as long as there was a single drop of blood in her body, yet she couldn't defend herself from the blast.</p><br><p>Numerous wounds covered her body, blood flowed from gaps in the lacerations, the lightning had not spared her.</p><br><p>Adam cast a glance in her direction.</p><br><p>'Indeed, she won't stop. It's dangerous, she might die... regeneration isn't that strong. Well, it's her choice. I have to think about my life.'</p><br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch moved forward with a confident stride, his arms spread apart, his gaze majestic and full of arrogance.</p><br><p>"I am waiting. Show me what you can do together. Fight against me while you can."</p><br><p>Adam and Katrin didn't need to hear anything else.</p><br><p>Without delay, they surrounded the Crimson Monarch, unleashing countless hail of blows on him, one after another not stopping.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the Crimson Monarch found the strength and speed to block each of them. The gaps between their strikes were too small for him to try and target Adam, but for Katrin, it was enough.</p><br><br><p>Dodging another lunge, the Crimson Monarch's gaze grew serious to an unprecedented degree.</p><br><p>Electric shocks ran through his eyes, assessing every movement of his enemies.</p><br><p>He found a way to get rid of one of them.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Katrin's black blades moved towards him, in one of her many attempts to finally win.</p><br><br><p>Without difficulty, the swords entered the Crimson Monarch's chest just short of touching his slowly beating heart.</p><br><p>Instead of trying to retreat or pull the enemy weapon from his chest, the Crimson Monarch stepped forward, allowing the blades to sink deeper into his flesh, the tips coming out of his back.</p><br><p>Katrin's eyes went wide in disbelief, then she felt five claws touch her stomach.</p><br><p>"Take your weapon away. You're trying to reach things beyond your limits."</p><br><p>Energy pooled beneath his palm, blasting the dense orb in scarlet flames.</p><br><p>With black jets of smoke, Katrin flew aside, her eyes empty - she lost consciousness. Despite the force of the electrical blast, her grip remained as strong, two swords coming out of the Crimson Monarch's chest.</p><br><p>As soon as her back touched the ground, Adam jerked, about to rush into the fight, but something stopped him.</p><br><p>His eyes went wide in doubt, he had seen something like this once before - recently it happened to him, here in the fortress.</p><br><p>Black particles, one by one stealthily came out from Katrin, an invisible shiver passed over the swords, their last hour would come faster than Katrin's.</p>
