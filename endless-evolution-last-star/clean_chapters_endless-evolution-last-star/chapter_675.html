            <br><p>Monsters just like humans were able to gain experience, experience was built from past events as well as memories, also creating perceptions of specific things.</p><br><p>Every monster long enough had its attitude towards Phantoms. If it was someone strong, then the monster had already killed quite a few Phantoms along the way, it considered itself stronger and higher than humans.</p><br><p>The Blinding Sylphyre was one of those monsters.</p><br><p>Most of the Phantoms that tried to get to the Fortress of the Lone Serpent tried to take the obvious path - the bridge, respectively facing the Blinding Sylphyre and dying an ignominious death.</p><br><p>The monster expected the lone Phantom to be trembling with fear, or at least be deadly serious preparing for a possibly lethal battle, but...</p><br><p>There was only excitement in Adam's eyes, a desire to fight without even contemplating defeat was not an option.</p><br><p>The Blinding Sylphyre was strong enough and as a consequence intelligent enough to understand what Adam was feeling and what it meant. For a proud monster, for a bridge guardian, it was a humiliation that caused a raging flame deep inside.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The monster's long body trembled, its wide scales reflecting a lone gleam as the Blinding Sylphyre came into motion.</p><br><p>A white energy wave traveled along the monster, transforming it into a deadly flash willing to pierce its target like a magical spear.</p><br><p>When the enemy attacked it was necessary to either defend or dodge, even a child who saw at least one battle in his life knew that.</p><br><p>But, Adam seemed to have forgotten that rule.</p><br><br><p>The Blinding Sylphyre crashed into Adam less than a second later, a direct hit on a creature ten times smaller in size.</p><br><p>The smile on Adam's face grew wider as his palms covered some of the bright light, his hands collided with the monster's outstretched head, feeling the sharp protruding spikes around the edges.</p><br><p>Experience new stories on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>It was a Mid Yellow monster, while Adam was only a K2W0-Phantom, such an attack should have seriously damaged or even killed it, but all the Blinding Sylphyre accomplished was to move Adam back a few meters.</p><br><p>Two lines of dust were left on the bridge, but that was the end of the impact.</p><br><p>"Hey, now I have to go to the center of the bridge again. Are you so reluctant to let me get in?" Adam mockingly said, standing at the border of the bridge and the bank.</p><br><p>The monster's eyes went wide, wanting to destroy Adam right here and now, but the Blinding Sylphyre had no paws or legs to reach Adam, only its long body and...</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Hundreds of sharp teeth opened wide inside the deep throat, its muscles tensed and its jaws slowly opened, about to fulfill Adam's challenge.</p><br><br><p>Soon, for some reason the jaws couldn't open wide enough, all the Blinding Sylphyre was capable of was a few centimeters, even the palm of a child's hand would have trouble fitting into such a gap.</p><br><p>"Is something wrong?"</p><br><p>Adam's eyes looked down at the monster, his hands gripping the edges of its jaw tightly, preventing it from opening wider.</p><br><p>The Blinding Sylphyre wanted to roar, but it could not, it had only one means to get rid of the insolent Phantom!</p><br><p>The snow-white pulse traveled through its body again, throwing a ring of light at Adam with the same force as the previous burst.</p><br><p>For a moment, the grin disappeared from Adam's face, he tried to block the momentum, but didn't have time to do anything - it threw him off the bridge.</p><br><p>With a powerful gust of wind, Adam crashed into the nearest hill, sinking into dense layers of dust.</p><br><p>The Blinding Sylphyre as an experienced monster didn't jump to conclusions, he realized that a Phantom like Adam wouldn't stop after one failure, and it was completely right.</p><br><br><p>Like a sparkling shadow, Adam ran out of the hill, in a few leaps, finding himself right in front of the Blinding Sylphyre. There was no seriousness or coldness in his eyes that accompanied him at the top of the walls - only pure delight.</p><br><br><p>A bare fist slammed into the tough scales from bottom to top, straining the thick hide, trying to protect the monster's throat.</p><br><p>Before the Blinding Sylphyre could do anything Adam leapt forward, climbing onto his opponent's massive head.</p><br><p>"You may be a monster, but given your build, your head is your weak spot just like humans!"</p><br><p>With a full desire to continue, Adam put his fists together before bringing them down directly on the monster's skull like a steel hammer.</p><br><p>Although Adam didn't use any abilities, his physical strength and energy control were more than enough to break through the top layer of scales.</p><br><p>When Adam first became K2-Phantom, it was unlikely that he could even scratch such strong scales with his attack, but... now it was different.</p><br><br><p>Bursts of blood rushed outward from the monster's torn flesh, dousing Adam's cheeks, flowing in crimson trickles.</p><br><p>"ROOOOOOOAAAAAAAAARRRR!!!!"</p><br><p>A painful roar came from the depths of the Blinding Sylphyre's throat, eerie enough to instill terror in any monster or Phantom if one were around.</p><br><p>However, to Adam, it was only proof that his attack was successful.</p><br><p>Sure, it wasn't enough to kill the Blinding Sylphyre, for that, Adam would need a few more equally powerful strikes, that's what he would do next!</p><br><p>'Alright, let's see how strong your skull is!' Adam exclaimed internally, his smirk filled with slight cruelty.</p><br><br><p>His heavy fists came down on the monster's head again, when suddenly something threw it off its head.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, watching the Blinding Sylphyre's long body whizzing before him.</p><br><p>Glittering scales with the blood-covered head quickly moved towards the edge, disappearing behind the bridge.</p><br><br><p>The next thing Adam heard was a few splashes of water, meaning only one thing:</p><br><p>"He... he escaped...?" Adam muttered in disbelief.</p><br><p>His expression changed abruptly as he ran to the edge of the bridge, looking at the murky water deep below, a long shadow floating in a circle.</p><br><p>"Damn, my first monster in a long time, and it got away from me."</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Adam shook his head before turning around - looking up at the majestic gate as black as the night itself.</p><br><p>"Well, that just means I passed the guard, right?"</p><br><br><p>"At least one of them."</p>
