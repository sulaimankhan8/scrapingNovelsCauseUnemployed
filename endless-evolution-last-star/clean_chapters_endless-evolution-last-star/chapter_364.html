            <br><br><p>Nessa's claws rained down on Plague Reaper like a hail of blades. Her muscles were tensed like steel ropes, veins inflated with occasional shivering, hot steam emanated from her entire body. She was at her limit, doing everything she could to buy a little more time.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper, unlike Nessa who had a furious expression on her face, tried to remain calm and collected.</p><br><p>Katrin's plan made his task much more difficult, but... Nessa was clearly not strong enough to compete with him. She woefully lacked the mastery and ability to hold off Plague Reaper.</p><br><br><p>The scythe spun rapidly in Plague Reaper's nimble hands, the black blade releasing sparks blocking Nessa's claws, occasionally, the end of the handle would hit Nessa's body leaving more bruises and small cuts.</p><br><p>'No... Something's not right. I'm giving it my best shot, I can feel my body ready to burst from the exertion, but... he dares to take his eyes off me?!' Nessa inwardly exclaimed with anger looking at Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's eyes were only occasionally turned towards Nessa. He was quite often glancing at what was happening near Fume Cathedral.</p><br><p>Adam and Katrin were attacking Scarlet Pyromancer from all directions.</p><br><p>In fact, Adam could kill Scarlet Pyromancer even in ten seconds given its current state, but he had to make sure that Katrin's genes got as much influence over Scarlet Pyromancer's genes as possible.</p><br><br><p>Adam burst forward, finding himself in front of Scarlet Pyromancer, whose broad wings were already covered in numerous cuts, bleeding, but they weren't serious wounds.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The glands at Scarlet Pyromancer's jaw quivered releasing powerful flame streams outward. Adam simply bounced back, only to appear next to Scarlet Pyromancer the next moment, swinging his long needle.</p><br><p>The sharp tip effortlessly cut through the monster's protective chitin, leaving a light, open wound.</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer was a Top-8 Purple Threat monster. For many K1-Phantoms, it would be a real threat, but for Adam, it was already a pretty weak monster.</p><br><p>He had killed two different Top-2 monsters and had fought against Plague Reaper in an even match.</p><br><p>But... now he had to carefully wound Scarlet Pyromancer only for Katrin to take advantage of it.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>A multitude of spiky roots emerged from the ground, pointing their sharp tips at Scarlet Pyromancer. Seeing this, Adam bounced to the side. If there was a way to make sure his genes didn't come in contact with Scarlet Pyromancer's genes, he had to do it.</p><br><p>Silvana and Alan were helping their Phantoms do the right thing.</p><br><p>It was on Silvana's advice that Adam decided to only inflict scratches on his opponent, weakening him and allowing Katrin to do much more damage.</p><br><p>"It's already been two minutes... Three more to go... after that, I'll be a little weaker..." Katrin muttered intently looking at Scarlet Pyromancer.</p><br><p>She effortlessly controlled the root arrays using her energy. The roots looked like nature's wrath, majestic and irreversible.</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer shuddered due to the ground shaking from the dozens of roots rushing towards him.</p><br><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer let out a strange growl, directing streams of flame at the roots using his wings, but... now it was useless.</p><br><p>Katrin had used a lot of energy to make her roots stronger than they had ever been. The powerful flames were only able to burn them a little and scorch the thorns, but there was no way the wave of fire could stop the bloodthirsty roots.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Passing through the veil of red flames, the roots crashed straight into the cuts and scratches on Scarlet Pyromancer's body, digging deeply into the wounds left by Adam.</p><br><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer fluttered his wings in a painful roar, trying to get rid of the roots causing him to be in true agony.</p><br><p>"That's not all!" Katrin exclaimed before she flapped her other hand, her fingertips covered in red energy, she was going to use her Second Order.</p><br><p>Sure, explosive flowers weren't supposed to be effective against a fire monster, but Katrin's goal wasn't just to hurt Scarlet Pyromancer as much as possible.</p><br><p>She was to absorb the monster with her influence and make it so that her Evolution Tree would have full control over Scarlet Pyromancer's genes after his death, which would happen very soon.</p><br><br><p>Black massive roots appeared around Scarlet Pyromancer, clutching tightly around the large monster's body. Katrin spent as much of her energy as she could, causing red lights to erupt in the air from where the roots appeared, not just from the ground. Enjoy exclusive content from empire</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer hadn't gotten rid of all the spiky roots yet, so there was no way he could dodge this attack.</p><br><p>Then, at Katrin's will, a multitude of red flowers opened up before exploding, plunging Scarlet Pyromancer into a fiery inferno.</p><br><br><p>Adam appeared beside Katrin, staring intently at the flaming pillar burning after the explosion.</p><br><p>"We have to kill him first... Only then can you absorb the Initial Gene, right?" Adam asked, realizing that with each passing second they had less and less time left.</p><br><br><p>"We should weaken it even more. Considering my roots attacked into the wounds you left, I've definitely done more damage to him. I must give him the final strike. Make it so he can't move." Katrin said seriously. In her head, she already had a full-blown plan on how she could turn Scarlet Pyromancer into a motionless corpse.</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>"Should I chop off his legs?"</p><br><p>Katrin shook her head.</p><br><p>"No. In that case, you'll do too much damage to him. I don't want to risk it. Just damage his tendons, then I'll do it myself."</p><br><p>Adam nodded slowly before stepping forward, turning into a lightning flash.</p><br><p>Before this, Katrin had often been nervous, sometimes almost panicking and trying to figure out how to deal with the crisis they got into because of Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>However, when they finally set out to do what they went on this mission for, Katrin changed completely.</p><br><p>She acted coldly and pragmatically. In her head, she had already visualized many times how she would kill Scarlet Pyromancer and absorb his gene to get a new Initial Gene.</p><br><p>To her, Scarlet Pyromancer was no opponent, especially with Adam helping her.</p><br><p>Katrin looked at Scarlet Pyromancer like a butcher sharpening his cleaver before slaughtering another victim.</p><br><p>Sure, it wasn't in her plans to confront Plague Reaper, but Nessa was trying to buy them time.</p><br><br><p>Adam dashed next to Scarlet Pyromancer, his needle slicing Scarlet Pyromancer's legs, rendering them practically useless.</p><br><p>Then, spiky roots twisted around his injured legs, and Katrin jerked her hand, at once, the roots ripped Scarlet Pyromancer's legs from his body.</p><br><p>Before Scarlet Pyromancer could escape the pain, Adam got a new task and badly wounded Scarlet Pyromancer's wings.</p><br><p>Katrin didn't waste any effort in trying to tear off Scarlet Pyromancer's heavy and sturdy wings, but she effortlessly pierced them dozens of times with her roots, making multiple holes in them.</p><br><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer tried to do something, but his strength was already low.</p><br><p>Osana tilted her head looking at Katrin's cold face. She took no pleasure in such a brutal murder, she was just carrying out part of the plan, after all her life depended on it.</p><br><p>'How cold-blooded, but...' Osana glanced at Plague Reaper who realized that soon Katrin would get a new Initial Gene and become a full-formed combat Phantom.</p><br><p>'A cornered beast is scary. We have yet to see what Plague Reaper will do in a desperate situation.'</p><br><p>Osana narrowed her eyes glaring at Adam.</p><br><p>'Well... That just means I have to be ready. Their plan must not fail.'</p>
