            <br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>An active shudder passed through the arena, sent from the many silver shards, recently a massive spear had turned them into nothing, but now a new power was about to restore them to their former glory and even give them a new image.</p><br><p>The only thing that mattered was victory. Every part of Adam's powers understood that, willing to do whatever was necessary to achieve the goal.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, the shards traveled toward Adam's hand, drawn by crimson energy, they took the shape of a needle, but... it wasn't a weapon, just a group of shards attached to each other.</p><br><p>Discover stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Such a needle was incapable of withstanding even a single attack.</p><br><br><p>Hot vapor with a low growl came out from Adam when the thick chain came into motion.</p><br><p>The chain twisted around the needle like a snake of disaster, shaking vigorously as if trying to turn the shards into dust.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the crimson energy became stronger, condensing around the chain and the needle as if trying to burn it like hellfire.</p><br><p>It didn't take long, unlike Fromund's abilities, it was only an imitation fire, not a real hot flame.</p><br><br><p>Adam's hand clenched tighter around the hilt of his new weapon most of which was in a tight sheath of crimson energy like a scabbard. A thick chain enveloped his hand, tightening the grip around the hilt to the limit, rather his hand would tear away from his body than he would let it go.</p><br><p>Without delay, not wanting to wait any longer, Adam gradually pulled the weapon from its sheath.</p><br><p>After a hard, black hilt without a guard, a broad red blade was revealed, divided into two parts, one half was flat while the other was covered with cruel teeth.</p><br><p>It was a copy of the Desecrated Sword - Adam's Power Gene and the essence of that power.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>With a sweep of his arm, cleaving the air, Adam sent violent torrents of wind in Fromund's direction as screaming ghosts escaped from the eternal dungeon where only torture and endless suffering awaited them.</p><br><p>Fromund shielded himself with his hand, holding his spear tightly, the wind did not cause him any wounds, but... the ground at his feet was covered in deep cuts.</p><br><p>The mere aura and the simple swing of a gruesome weapon were enough to strike fear into the hearts of many viewers, especially if they were ordinary humans.</p><br><p>They trembled, their teeth clattered, and cold sweat ran down their foreheads, but they continued to watch, eager to see who would win - the flame warrior or the crimson knight.</p><br><p>Those who were stronger had different reactions, some were surprised, some looked curious or confused. Most of them did not expect Adam to be able to get out of such a difficult situation and show something new.</p><br><p>But... what did any of that matter?</p><br><p>The only one whose reaction counted was the second fighter, Fromund, as he was facing the new Adam.</p><br><p>"Well, well, looks like I'm not the only one with multiple weapons, is it? Hah, you know, it's pretty hilarious."</p><br><p>A bright flame burned in Fromund's eyes. A few seconds ago, he was disappointed that he couldn't finish the battle, but that didn't take away his desire to fight.</p><br><p>"My second weapon was a sword, like yours. The size and essence are different, yet it is the same weapon type."</p><br><p>Perhaps, Fromund was expecting some sort of response, but it didn't come, Adam was silent, he hadn't uttered a single word since activating his Power Gene.</p><br><p>"Silent? So you're serious... That's good, I wouldn't expect anything less. Attack!"</p><br><p>With a belligerent exclamation, Fromund swung his spear, the massive twisted tip aimed at Adam as the embers between the gaps began to burn intensely.</p><br><br><p>A few sparks ignited at the spear tip before bright flames covered the entire blade, burning everything around it.</p><br><p>'Hmm?' Fromund frowned.</p><br><p>'Can't he hear me as well? What this ability did to him?'</p><br><p>'Agh... Never mind. We're on equal terms now. We're both using our Power Genes, I just have to keep fighting and win as originally planned!'</p><br><br><p>At the very moment Fromund was ready to attack, Adam took a step forward, sending a slight tremor through the ground.</p><br><p>For some reason, this seemed familiar to Fromund, and Arayna noticed it as well.</p><br><p>'Wait... The same steps were when Fromund was carrying his hammer without any amplification... Does that mean Adam's limited armor weighs that much, or is it the simple strength of his legs?'</p><br><p>Silvana had questions as well, but of a different matter.</p><br><p>'It's related to Steel Knight since Adam got his Power Gene from that monster, but... Steel Knight didn't look so intimidating...'</p><br><p>Then, her gaze moved to Adam's sword, such a gruesome dual blade instinctively made her feel uneasy.</p><br><p>'And... why does he have one sword and only have a fraction of the armor? Fuck, I know that the image of the Steel Knight is influenced by Adam's path as a Phantom, but... it just makes me feel uneasy.'</p><br><br><p>Adam's silhouette shuddered, disappearing from Fromund's field of vision.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a shadow fell across his face, causing his pupils to narrow - his blue eyes reflected a crimson knight, his sword drawn to attack.</p><br><p>'Quick! I'll have time to block! Then I can counterattack!'</p><br><br><p>A cascade of sparks flew off to the side, the spear collided with the straight blade of the sword, this side looking down while the teeth were up.</p><br><br><p>A muffled pain resounded in Fromund's knees, they shook violently ready to collapse to the ground at any moment, barely able to absorb the recoil from one Adam's strike.</p><br><p>The shockwave threw waves of dust aside, clearing the ground around them, revealing sharp protruding rocks between the many cuts brought by past clashes.</p><br><br><p>A heavy wheeze echoed from Adam's throat, it was his first word since the appearance of the desecrated sword.</p><br><p>"You will lose... The monster behind your Power Gene... It wanted to fight, but not win... I can feel it... My fight was harder... And...</p><br><p>So this will be your end."</p><br><p>Before Fromund could reply, Adam's hand fell on his face, clutching it with immense force - repeating his final move with which he had killed the Steel Knight a long time ago.</p><br><p>'No... If it continues like this... then he...!'</p><br><p>Terror filled Fromund's gaze, his veins swelled, and a sharp pain pierced his mind. He felt that in a few more seconds, Adam's grip would simply blast his head into bloody shards!</p><br><br><p>Adam applied only more force and... the flaming hoop on Fromund's head cracked, unable to withstand the pressure any longer.</p><br><p>A few sparks flew out as the harbingers of a mighty flame were ready to start a hellish blaze.</p>
