            <br><p>"Yes! I win!" Hazel exclaimed joyfully, jumping up with a clenched fist.</p><br><p>In the end, Adam was able to score 85 points and Hazel, an incredible 101 points.</p><br><p>However, had Hazel not been drunk and fully focused, out of twenty-one times, she would have hit everything in the center. For a Phantom, whose Nexus was a long-range weapon - accuracy was not an issue.</p><br><p>Adam inhaled heavily.</p><br><p>For a moment he thought he might actually win, but he was still a long way from Hazel's level. Well, in fact, he didn't need shooting skills at such a high level.</p><br><p>"Hey, don't feel bad! You performed just fine!" Zera patted Adam's shoulder encouragingly.</p><br><p>"Yeah, I guess the shooting range isn't where I have to compete with Hazel if I want to win." Adam nodded, looking at the target. His last three shots had been accurately centered.</p><br><p>For the Phantom, precision with firearms was nothing special, as their senses and instincts were on a different level from normal humans. However, it was only possible to maintain stability with a certain level of skill.</p><br><br><p>Zera handed Adam a chain with a bronze bullet.</p><br><br><br><p>"A consolation prize! Your score deserves it, especially considering it was your first time."</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam muttered with a slight smile on his face as he pressed the bullet to his chest.</p><br><p>He had just gotten another item that would become an important part of his collection.</p><br><br><p>That evening, like all the others, came to an end, and soon the next day began.</p><br><p>Adam's head was filled with various thoughts, usually at times like this he devoted his energy to training, but not today. He was somewhat disappointed in the virtual chamber, he would definitely use the virtual zone to practice, but only for initial experience.</p><br><p>Adam decided to concentrate on his thoughts and just watch the videos of the other Phantoms' battles along with Silvana. She was an excellent analyst, so with her help, Adam could learn from the mistakes of others.</p><br><br><p>Several messages showed up on his NEP.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow, then he got a confused expression, "What the hell...?"</p><br><br><p>Step. Step. Another Step.</p><br><p>Adam entered one of the many coffee shops in the Third Ring, with the clear purpose of meeting Silvana and an unknown guest.</p><br><p>"Oh, he's finally here! Hey! Over here!"</p><br><p>A man with a pale green suit exclaimed, waving his hand.</p><br><p>Adam looked away, with mild curiosity and puzzlement.</p><br><p>Across from Silvana, sat a man with slicked-back blond hair and green eyes. He wasn't a Phantom, since he didn't have NEP, nor did he have an aura, but he was obviously no ordinary person.</p><br><p>"Hi." Adam said to Silvana, then he turned to the man.</p><br><p>"Good afternoon. My name is Artan Fritz!" Artan pronounced, extending his hand.</p><br><p>Adam responded with a handshake and sat down next to Silvana, she moved forward, making room for him.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter, though I think you already know that." Adam said calmly, looking intently at Artan.</p><br><p>Atran nodded with a slight smile.</p><br><p>"I won't waste your time, and I'll tell you right away why I called you here. I want to interview you and invite you to the Phantom Preparatory Academy!" Artan exclaimed energetically.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"An interview...? You can forget about that right now. I've had enough of idiots from Proud Wing recognizing me and trying to charge me with assault. I'd like to hear more about the academy. How do you prepare Phantoms? Isn't Spark the only chance to become a Phantom?"</p><br><p>Artan sighed heavily. He wanted to interview Adam, it would be a real accomplishment and sensation for him, but he was ready for rejection.</p><br><p>After all, the Phantoms were not celebrities who only looked for fame and popularity. For the Phantoms, the most important thing was their strength and authority, so Artan was doomed to fail from the start.</p><br><p>"That's right, there's no way to know if a person will become a Phantom, or not until they have Spark at a certain age. However, some do have a good chance due to bloodlines, also such academies aren't academies like others."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, showing that he didn't understand what Artan was talking about.</p><br><p>"Agh. Look, because of my position, I know that you are a Naturalborn Phantom, so you don't know what process the other Phantoms go through, the ones who got Spark during the test." Artan said with a complicated expression. He didn't want to bring it up, but otherwise, he wouldn't be able to explain anything.</p><br><p>Adam listened attentively. He hadn't given it much thought, but now that Artan had mentioned it, he was curious.</p><br><p>"Khm. Unlike your case, once a person is found to have Spark, they are sent to a preparatory academy for a week. We give them training, drills, theory, and practice. Then, together with a special squad they go to the research department and kill the prepared monster there." Artan explained.</p><br><p>"I see... Well, that makes sense. However, I don't understand why you would go to an academy like that if you don't know whether you'll have Spark or not?" Adam asked, confused.</p><br><br><p>"People are arrogant and presumptuous, especially those whose parents are Phantoms. You know, it actually increases the odds. Yeah, getting Spark doesn't work for everyone, but it can be compared to a simple physics or math exam, I guess."</p><br><br><p>"Not everyone sure to pass the exam does so, and the same goes for Spark. For this reason, rich families with two Phantom parents have quite a few children, anything to ensure that at least one of them succeeds and can continue the lineage."</p><br><p>Silvana gave Artan a hard look.</p><br><p>"Your comparison is incorrect. If you study well, 100/100 students will pass the math test, however, Spark's appearance depends only on luck."</p><br><br><br><p>"What...?" Silvana frowned.</p><br><p>"You're right in theory, but never all students will pass the test. It's just not possible. Whatever, we've gotten off-topic. Adam, what do you say? Would you like to spend one class with me at the academy as a special guest?"</p><br><p>Adam didn't answer right away, he hesitated, rubbing his chin with a complicated expression.</p><br><br><p>"Fine, but only once. I'm just curious to see how it goes. One will be enough to satisfy my curiosity."</p><br><p>Artan smiled broadly.</p><br><p>"Perfect! In that case, let's set off right now! We only have half an hour left!" Artan exclaimed pointing to his watch on his wrist.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"What...? Right now?!"</p><br><p>Artan didn't answer anything, he just headed towards the exit of the coffee shop, moving to his car.</p><br><p>Adam turned to Silvana, hoping to get an answer from her at least.</p><br><p>Silvana only nodded slightly, confirming Artan's words.</p><br><p>"Shit! He knew I'd agree from the start!" Adam snorted, shook his head, and followed Artan's lead.</p><br><p>Adam had already agreed, so he had no right to refuse.</p><br><p>'Well... Perhaps it would be helpful for me to see the faces of the real newcomers and their thoughts about Dead Lands. What happened to me isn't normal, I need to see how things should be in ordinary situations.'</p>
