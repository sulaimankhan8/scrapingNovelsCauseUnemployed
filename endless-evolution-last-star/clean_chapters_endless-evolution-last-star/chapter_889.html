            <br><p>Three silhouettes moved from the palace of the Alderran Family, none of them were the head, but all of them were elders - K4-Phantoms approaching the evolutionary boundary of the First Circle. They had only one step left to take to become the Second Rank Phantoms, but for many that step never came.</p><br><p>Two of the men ran swiftly on the ground like ghosts, while the third of them, a middle-aged woman, raced through the air. White energy, like clouds enveloped her legs, occasionally exploding to maintain the momentum that allowed her to fly.</p><br><p>They only needed ten seconds before they reached the lake, but halfway through their journey, they saw a powerful crimson flame beating in the distance.</p><br><p>They glanced around before speeding up, quickly closing the distance and almost reaching the lake.</p><br><p>But, it was already too late.</p><br><p>A great sword swept over the lake, sending the crimson blade straight at Reinz who stood on the opposite side.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a previously unseen shiver ran through Reinz's body. All his instincts were screaming for him to run away.</p><br><br><p>It remained in full force. Only his pride would not let him dodge. He is Reinz Alderran, one of the talents of the first great family. He did not run away, and he did not lose.</p><br><p>The ten rings activated in a moment at full power. Two lightning-long horns like a demon appeared on his forehead as seven white orbs full of thunder power soared around him.</p><br><p>Reinz stretched his arms forward, gathering all his power at one point.</p><br><p>The thunder beam surged forward, colliding with the crimson blade in the middle of the lake.</p><br><p>Just as the three elders arrived on the scene.</p><br><p>A red and white star flashed at the point of impact, and a shiver ran through the always-calm lands of the Alderran Family.</p><br><p>The shockwave spread out tens of meters, rippling the surface of the great lake. The first splashes quickly turned into waves that rained down on the ordinary family members who hadn't escaped in time.</p><br><p>Immediately, the elders appeared in front of the hollow nobles, protecting them from the shockwave, combining devastating crimson energy and white electric discharges.</p><br><p>The hollow nobles may not have had the opportunity to hold a high position in the noble family. However, they were still part of the family - their lives were a million times more valuable than Phantom's life outside the family tree.</p><br><p>For a while, the two forces tried to suppress each other until the last electrical shocks dissipated into the air.</p><br><p>Reinz's pupils dilated, a cruel blade reflected in his eyes.</p><br><br><p>Streams of blood rushed outward, a long cut left on his chest, from his hips to the edge of his right shoulder.</p><br><p>His eyes clear as crystals went blank for a moment. He staggered towards the ground before he regained control out of his last strength and put one hand forward, touching the surface, yet his knees had already collapsed down.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."</p><br><p>Under his heavy breathing, clots of blood crashed to the ground, one by one.</p><br><p>Then, Reinz slowly raised his head, wanting to look at what condition his opponent was in.</p><br><p>But, before he did, he saw a more shocking scene.</p><br><p>The lake was split in two, the remnants of water struggling to fill the empty line of ruined land stretching from Adam to Reinz.</p><br><p>Adam, in his turn, continued to stand firmly on his feet. His energy consumption and earlier wounds were taking their toll, his breathing slow and his gaze exhausted, but his bright smile of triumph overshadowed any flaws.</p><br><p>Soon, the water calmed, and the elders looked at each other. Two men surrounded Adam, while the woman dipped lower, but she was still hovering above the ground.</p><br><p>"Who are you, young man?" her voice thundered at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam turned over his shoulder, about to answer.</p><br><p>But, someone beat him to it.</p><br><p>"This is Adam Vinter, Ms. Leira, please, don't be in a hurry to bring your anger down on him."</p><br><p>Everyone turned around, seeing a tall silhouette in a formal butler's suit, appear among the streetlights.</p><br><p>Andreas walked slowly, keeping a slight smile on his face. However, deep inside he was nervous, no one was prepared for what Adam and Reinz's fight had turned into.</p><br><p>Leira turned in his direction, an arrogant grimace covering her face.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Andreas? I don't know what happened at the Twilight Palace, but Adam Vinter broke into my family's territory and put the lives of the higher nobles in mortal danger."</p><br><p>Particles of white flame appeared near her fingertips.</p><br><p>"Wait!" Andreas exclaimed, even though he didn't stand a chance against the K4-Phantom who was on the brink, "Ms. Leira, please stop! This will be a mistake! Adam Vinter is a talented Phantom!"</p><br><p>However, it was clear from Leira's expression that she wasn't going to listen to him. She had never heard of Adam Vinter before, so he wasn't a high nobleman.</p><br><p>Given what he did, she wasn't even going to consider not killing him.</p><br><p>The flaming ray struck Adam like a thunderbolt, with speed and force that was beyond his comprehension.</p><br><p>Even for Reinz to see his elder's attack was problematic, he could only catch glimpses as well as the exhausted Adam.</p><br><br><p>The ray reached its target.</p><br><p>A smirk covered Leira's face, when the particles of fire dissipated, instead of Adam, she would see only empty space.</p><br><p>With the next flow of wind, everyone saw Adam's silhouette standing in the same spot. Oddly enough, he wasn't hit, but Leira certainly didn't miss. It was impossible for her and at such close range.</p><br><p>Adam couldn't seem to believe it either. His eyes were wide open, staring at the red square, the barrier hovering in front of him.</p><br><p>Goosebumps ran down Leira's body as she abruptly turned around.</p><br><p>"Who dare! This is the territory of the Alderran Family! Show yourself!"</p><br><p>Suddenly, a mocking voice came from above:</p><br><p>"Hm? I'm not hiding. Didn't you notice me?"</p><br><p>Leira looked up sharply only to see a man in a black vest and dark red shirt, a long, stylish cane in his hand.</p><br><p>That wasn't the only thing that surprised Leira - for the man was standing upside down. His feet rested on the air, while his thick crimson hair was pointing downward with the tips.</p><br><p>As soon as Leira saw the man, his eyes as red as bloody rubies, she instinctively jumped back.</p><br><p>"Erik Wurhen! How...! What are you doing here!" Leira exclaimed, half in anger half in fear.</p><br><p>Before he could answer, Erik bounced off the invisible platform before sitting down in mid-air, he threw one leg over the other.</p><br><p>"Is it not clear? If I hadn't intervened there would not be a speck left of poor Adam. Your flames would have burned him. I couldn't let that happen."</p><br><p>Erik glanced at Adam.</p><br><p>"If Adam Vinter dies, I have no one else to bet on. I can't let that happen," his voice sharp, "Moreover, unlike you, I keep an eye out for young talent throughout the Citadel, not just among the nobles."</p><br><p>His eyes narrowed, mirroring Leira's startled one.</p><br><p>"Losing a Phantom like him would be a big mistake and a blow to the Citadel. Maybe not now, but in the future for sure." Erik looked at Andreas, "Am I right, Andreas?"</p><br><p>"Sure!" Andreas immediately replied, straightening his back, "I'm glad that the first person at the Wurhen Family realizes that this is all just a misunderstanding and shows how strong Adam Vinter and Reinz Alderran are as young men!"</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz didn't realize what was happening. They tried to look away from their fight, but with every second it was only getting more serious.</p><br><p>Leira gulped. She couldn't go against Erik, but she had obligations to her family, she had to maintain status.</p><br><p>"Even so. Adam Vinter invaded our territory, jeopardized my family members, and destroyed the lake! What do you think I should do? Just let him go?!" she was furious.</p><br><br><br><p>Erik smiled, seeming to exude nothing but benevolence.</p><br><p>"Just let him go is what I want. After all, he wasn't fighting against the Alderran Family, he was a participant in the final battle. If you followed the events at the Twilight Palace, you would know that."</p><br><p>"But...!" Leira gasped, "I don't have the authority to set territories! That was handled by the assistant head!"</p><br><p>With a thoughtful expression, Erik rubbed his chin before nodding slightly.</p><br><p>"I see... Well, doesn't that mean that a fight between Adam and a member of your family is approved at the highest level?"</p><br><p>Leira didn't have an answer.</p><br><p>"If the head would be here and voice their displeasure then this conversation would make sense." Erik crossed his arms over his chest, "But... With you? Pfffft, if this wasn't about protecting Adam, I wouldn't be wasting my time on you."</p><br><p>"Watch your words!" Leira threw her arm forward, "I may not be the head, but you don't have that status either!"</p><br><p>Leira decided to take advantage of the difficult situation of the Wurhen Family, at the moment they had no official head, even though every high nobleman was well aware of how powerful Erik Wurhen was.</p><br><p>She hoped for some kind of reaction but got none.</p><br><p>Erik didn't bother to listen to her anymore.</p><br><p>With a nonchalant face, he found himself next to Adam and touched his shoulder. A second later, Erik along with Adam appeared next to Reinz who was barely conscious.</p><br><p>Then, their three silhouettes turned into shadows, disappearing in an unknown direction.</p><br><p>Even a K4-Phantom like Leira couldn't keep track of Erik's movements.</p>
