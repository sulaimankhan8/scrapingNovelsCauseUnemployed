            <h4>Chapter 1052: Shining Dew (Part 2)</h4><br><br><p>Osmer and Rosana walked at a hurried pace toward one of the skulls at the Sacrificial Waterfalls. In the distance, several figures could be seen prowling among the great trees, some a disciple like Rosana and some an elder.
</p><br><p>Soon, they approached a bright ring hovering above a spacious altar in one of the halls inside the skull.
</p><br><p>The ring was made of pure blood of varying brightness and strength, swirling around a lone black orb releasing a powerful, ancient aura.
</p><br><p>Rosana didn’t have permission to use the ancestry ring, she didn’t even know how, but for Osmer, it wasn’t a problem. Moreover, he had a good reason for it - they needed to find Adam and figure out if he was at the Dark Shore.
</p><br><p>"Go ahead, you had to save his blood, didn’t you?"
</p><br><p>Osmer didn’t ask if she managed to wound Adam. He was sure she had, otherwise he would be sorely disappointed.
</p><br><p>"Sure, just as you taught me... I didn’t immediately absorb the blood of a strong opponent..." Rosana nodded as her frame trembled.
</p><br><p>Blood ran down her shoulder, revealing a jaw with one eye. A tongue showed outward, where a few drops of Adam’s blood remained at the tip.
</p><br><p>"Good. This is exactly why I appreciate you, Rosana. Even when faced with an unexpected outcome, you did the right thing." Osmer nodded slightly as he swung his hand.
</p><br><p>Adam’s blood soared in front of him, he took only two drops, leaving the rest for Rosana.
</p><br><p>One drop, Osmer swallowed, tasting it like an expensive wine so as not to miss a single detail.
</p><br><p>After all, they were regenerative monsters in their nature, though very different from the ones Adam met before. However, that was what he and any other Phantom should have expected when faced with a name-wielding monster.
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Osmer’s pupils dilated.
</p><br><p>"I see... This young man. He actually did what his fellows are incapable of. His blood is as strong as his aura... And... I sense darkness in him, but not just one..."
</p><br><p>Rosana’s eyes went wide at his words.
</p><br><p>"What?" She stammered. "Elder Osmer, are you saying that he killed two Hollow Wave monsters?"
</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Osmer nodded deeply.
</p><br><p>"I don’t know who that monster was before Arnoth, but it was most likely someone weaker... Or..."
</p><br><p>Osmer’s face darkened.
</p><br><p>"It was a monster who suffered a fate worse than Arnoth. The one who was uncovered too quickly and couldn’t recover even one-tenth of his strength..."
</p><br><p>If Adam were here, he would have just as many questions as Rosana, but right now the two of them had a more important task.
</p><br><p>A second drop floated in front of Osmer as he took a step forward.
</p><br><p>In a slight sweep of his hand, he directed the drop to the ancestry ring. A thin line of energy like a thread connected his fingertip and Adam’s drop of blood.
</p><br><p>Breathless, Rosana watched as the drop became part of the ring.
</p><br><p>A quick flash ran through the ring, returning to Osmer, who was expecting it.
</p><br><p>His eyes shone brightly, letting out scarlet rays like ghostly lanterns.
</p><br><p>Many fragments flashed through his mind until only one remained - a black-haired young man running towards a snow-white tree protected by a barrier.
</p><br><p>"Hmm... How strange. I expected him to be somewhere at the Sacrificial Waterfalls, but he appeared at the Sorrowful Dew Expanse."
</p><br><p>Suddenly, joy covered Rosana’s eyes.
</p><br><p>"Doesn’t that mean he’s finished? Hahaha, if he decides to approach one of the dew trees, he’ll be committing a great mistake! Nothing awaits him but death!"
</p><br><p>"He’s already done that. I can see it thanks to his own blood..."
</p><br><p>Osmer’s words made Rosana grin widely. To her, this was tantamount to a death sentence for Adam.
</p><br><p>"Hah, this is what he deserves! An ungraceful death awaits him!"
</p><br><p>However, Osmer did not jump to conclusions. He knew far more than Rosana, who was facing a Phantom like Adam for the first time.
</p><br><p>He touched his forehead, pondering with a grim look.
</p><br><p>"Gather the men. We’ll head to the foot of the western waterfall. If that young man is still alive, we can quickly get to him and kill him."
</p><br><p>"But... If he’s already touched a drew tree, doesn’t that mean that...?"
</p><br><p>Osmer’s voice became lower.
</p><br><p>"Do as I say! Follow your elder’s orders!"
</p><br><p>Rosana flinched. "Y-Yes!"
</p><br><p>Osmer was one of the calmest and patient elders. Even though she often made mistakes, he rarely raised his voice at her.
</p><br><p>So, Rosana knew that it only happened when something really important was happening.
</p><br><br><br><p>At the same time, Adam slowly strode toward a dew tree.
</p><br><p>Well, he didn’t know what the tree was called, he just couldn’t contain his curiosity. The high density of energy pressed down on him, but it was a pleasant pressure.
</p><br><p>’I don’t know how to describe it, but... unlike the resistance caves and the dark field where it was painful, it’s different here. It’s like this energy has not only a different density but a higher quality.’
</p><br><p>Adam shook his head, lifting his gaze.
</p><br><p>One of the dewdrops was ready to fall from the sharp tip of a branch. With a slight shiver, it ended up on Adam’s palm, soaking into his skin.
</p><br><br><p>A lone shiver ran through his Evolution Tree.
</p><br><p>’What, did I just absorb energy?’ Adam’s eyes went wide. ’No... That can’t be, right? Most likely, these drops have special qualities. It’s not just energy after all, it’s a resource.’
</p><br><br><p>Adam breathed a sigh of relief.
</p><br><p>He was safe, at least for now.
</p><br><p>He wanted to study the tree first, to understand why the other monsters didn’t risk taking such a valuable source of energy.
</p><br><p>Soon, Adam had his answer.
</p><br><p>A chill ran down his back, forcing him to turn around.
</p><br><p>In the distance, a dark silhouette of tattered shadows rode a grim horse. The horse’s white eyes resembled ghosts, while the purple silhouette’s eyes were clear and deep.
</p><br><p>But that wasn’t what caused Adam to react.
</p><br><br><p>As the unknown silhouette approached, his legs trembled and his knees crashed to the ground.
</p><br><p>The unknown monster’s aura alone was enough to bring him to the ground.
</p><br><p>The others knew about it.
</p><br><p>No one dared to disturb the dew trees since they were aware of the consequences.</p>
