            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1297: Needles Falling From the Sky (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>The fact that Phantom could use the threads that were usually the domain of the White Thread faction and a needle from the Gray Needle faction was, in itself, an alarming factor for the monsters of these lands.</p><br><p>However, not everyone realized that Adam never had the goal or even the ability to copy their abilities and techniques. He learned about the Forgotten Mills only recently, as well as about the three factions. They did not understand that all of Adam’s abilities belonged only to him and originated only from his energy and the Silver Weaver, whose origin had been changed beyond recognition during Adam’s long journey.</p><br><p>Unfortunately for Ureyn, he was one of those monsters. He was mistaken not only about Adam’s abilities but also about his goal. It was unknown whether he could change that for the sake of victory.</p><br><p>But that wasn’t all Adam was capable of. He was ready to show both the audience and Ureyn that even though they had a lot in common, his way was unique and unlike anyone else’s.</p><br><p>Unbeknownst to him, this became one of his goals, in addition to defeating Ureyn and obtaining the Connected Heart.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Two needles appeared simultaneously in Adam’s hand as his blue eyes shone brightly, eager to show only his growing excitement.</p><br><br><p>He already knew that Adam had two needles, but he didn’t want to believe that Adam could use them both at the same time. He figured that the strain on Adam’s body would be too much for that.</p><br><p>Well, Ureyn simply did not yet understand who he was fighting and what Adam was actually capable of enduring when necessary.</p><br><p>“Ureyn.” Adam smiled as streams of white energy flowed from his body. “I don’t want to insult your path, but don’t you think that trying to win a duel with techniques invented by someone else is humiliating and indicates your weakness?”</p><br><p>In response, Ureyn’s eyes widened in outrage. This was not what he wanted to hear from a creature that had been on the path of power for only a year!</p><br><p>“Shut your mouth!” Ureyn roared furiously, swinging his needle.</p><br><p>He refused to admit that there was even a grain of truth in Adam’s words.</p><br><p>“Just because you have our abilities doesn’t mean anything! You’re new to this world and don’t know what you’re talking about!”</p><br><p>Then, he saw a smug grin on the other side.</p><br><p>“Oh, really?” Adam chuckled, slowly bringing the two needles together. “You know, I’ve fought monsters many times, and there’s one thing I’ve learned about you.”</p><br><p>He lifted his chin, looking down at Ureyn.</p><br><p>“The strongest one is right.”</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam joined the two needles together.</p><br><p>All eyes turned to his needle, with its wide black blade and white edges along which energy ran like a stream of water.</p><br><p>“Get ready, Ureyn. You may not survive this attack—I doubt that even one of your faction’s techniques will help you.”</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With the black burst, Adam disappeared, crossing dozens of meters faster than the speed of sound.</p><br><p>Still, Ureyn had enough time to take the necessary gray pierce stance again. Like any other monster of the Gray Needle, he was able to do this in a fraction of a second.</p><br><p>But… Could his technique compare to Adam’s grand path?</p><br><p>Strangely enough, despite all the power emanating from Adam in front of him, Ureyn was confident that he could handle this test.</p><br><p>‘Alright, it doesn’t matter what he’s trying to do. Even if he used a little more energy, it doesn’t change anything. Now that I’ve accepted my nature… There are no more barriers in front of me!’</p><br><br><p>Last time, the gray flash collided with the white one, but this time it was completely different.</p><br><p>The gray color disappeared almost immediately, and the white one appeared only for a moment, leaving room for darkness that swept across the battlefield in a straight line like a black stream.</p><br><p>The first to realize what had happened were the Black Cut members.</p><br><p>“Hahaha! Go, boy!” the red-haired man exclaimed.</p><br><p>In support, the girl with pigtails jumped up. “Yes! That’s real power!”</p><br><p>This time, even Norax didn’t hold back, which was not good news for either Ureyn or Nollura, who were standing next to him.</p><br><p>“Not bad, not bad at all.” Norax’s voice rang out, causing Nollura to gulp in fear.</p><br><p>She pressed her palm to her chest, nervously waiting for the cloud of smoke to dissipate so everyone could see the result of their latest clash.</p><br><br><p>With the next gust of wind, Ureyn appeared, still in his stance, holding the hilt of his needle with both hands.</p><br><p>It seemed that he had not yet understood what had happened.</p><br><br><p>Then, his eyes widened as a stream of blood gushed from his right side, immediately causing him to collapse to one knee.</p><br><p>“Gha… Gah… Gha…” Ureyn breathed heavily while blood continued to flow from his wide-open wound. If he had been even slightly weaker, Adam’s attack would have cut his body in two, there was no doubt about that.</p><br><p>Everything before Ureyn’s eyes blurred as he clenched his wound tightly, directing energy to his palm. He had to do everything in his power to stop the bleeding and force the edges of the flesh to close.</p><br><p>Sure, it wouldn’t heal him, but it would allow him to continue fighting, postponing serious bleeding until later.</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam, who was standing in the distance, took a deep breath, not bothering to turn to his opponent.</p><br><p>The needle in his hand continued to emit black and white streams of energy, and Silvana, who knew Adam’s abilities well, noticed the changes.</p><br><p>“The darkness… It has become much greater. Before, it wasn’t even 10%, but now… the darkness is almost a third…”</p><br><p>“Agh, that’s another matter.”</p><br><p>Adam smiled before glancing at Ureyn, who was suffering from pain.</p><br><p>“What now? A few more techniques, or will you finally show what Ureyn, the Grim Wind, is capable of, rather than just another member of the Gray Needle?”</p>
