            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1282: Arachne Nollura</strong></p><br><p>A little earlier, Silvana showed Adam what he should expect from the Arachne he was going after in the Arachne Nest.</p><br><p>To her surprise, Adam’s reaction to the monster’s appearance was only negative emotions and even disgust. He was ready to face any monster that looked like a monster, not a half-human, half-monster.</p><br><p>Well, regardless of his wishes, he was going to face Nollura anyway, and when that happened, Adam found himself in a strange situation.</p><br><p>He was genuinely glad that Nollura didn’t look anything like the Arachnes Silvana had shown him, but… her unique appearance couldn’t be good news for him in any case.</p><br><p>The corners of Nollura’s lips curved upward into a sly smile.</p><br><p>“Oh, looks like you were expecting to see something else, right?” She giggled.</p><br><p>Adam blinked several times and shook his head.</p><br><p>Without saying a word, he shrugged as his frame trembled.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, he appeared right in front of Nollura. A glint ran along the long blade of the needle, moving straight toward Nollura’s neck.</p><br><p>Nollura’s eight spider-blades lunged forward, blocking Adam’s needle and counterattacking.</p><br><p>A cascade of sparks flew before their eyes, torn apart by the next blade aimed at Adam’s head.</p><br><p>He tilted his head to the side, allowing the blade to fly past as he spun around, plunging his foot straight into Nollura’s left side.</p><br><p>At the last moment, she used the center, non-sharp tips of her spider-legs to block Adam’s kick.</p><br><p>The impact threw Nollura to the side, but she used her spider-legs to hook onto a pillar and soften the blow.</p><br><p>“Hah, you’re one of those who gets straight to the point?” Nollura smirked, but the nervous tremor of her lips showed that she hadn’t expected such aggressive action from Adam.</p><br><p>“Well.” Adam waved his needle, slicing through the air. “I came here with one goal, and unfortunately for you, I need your head to achieve it. As you understand, you won’t survive without your head, so… let’s not waste each other’s time.”</p><br><p>“W-Wait!” Nollura exclaimed, trying to say something.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, attacking her again.</p><br><p>The black spiders around them were in no hurry to help Nollura. Although they were not dangerous to Adam, they were high-level monsters. They did not have much experience due to their young age, but their instincts practically screamed at them not to approach Adam and Nollura.</p><br><p>This was not their level, and it would be no problem for either of them to cut the black spiders to pieces as soon as they were within their fire range.</p><br><br><p>Sparks from the blows flew throughout the hall, shaking the web and causing the black spiders to scatter, hiding in fear behind rocks and crevices.</p><br><p>Even though Nollura had eight blades and two free hands, she was struggling to hold off Adam’s onslaught coming from just one needle.</p><br><p>It was clear from her gaze that she wanted to say something to Adam, because in a way, she had been expecting him to come here.</p><br><p>But she didn’t have time for that. Now, she was fighting for her life.</p><br><p>“ENOUGH!” Nollura exclaimed as green flames ran across her spider blades.</p><br><p>The explosion threw Adam aside, and before he could regain his balance, a multitude of green chains appeared from the cluster of floating fire, grabbing Adam by the wrists.</p><br><br><p>Nollura landed on the ground, looking at Adam hovering above the surface. The chains pulled his arms and legs in different directions, and it seemed that Nollura had managed to capture him.</p><br><p>“Alright, now, let’s discuss why you came here…”</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Before she could finish, a powerful aura burst from Adam, causing not only the black spiders but also Nollura to shiver.</p><br><p>White energy enveloped Adam’s fist, full of tense muscles and bulging veins, as he jerked his arm, breaking the chain.</p><br><p>A multitude of links flew apart as he freed his other hand and, with one swing of the needle, cut the remaining chains.</p><br><p>Nollura’s eyes widened as she stared at Adam in disbelief.</p><br><p>‘What? How the fuck did he do that? Our auras aren’t that different!’</p><br><p>It was a mistake for Nollura to think about this in the heat of battle, because the next moment she saw Adam release his needle and white disks appear above his hands.</p><br><p>The silver threads moved aside, calmly cutting through the wind.</p><br><p>‘Shit!’ Nollura noticed the approaching threads too late.</p><br><br><p>She tried to cut them, but at the last moment, energy like white flames enveloped the treads, stopping the green blades.</p><br><br><p>Nollura’s face changed abruptly from confused to pained when the silver threads wrapped around her wrist and slammed her against the nearest pillar.</p><br><br><p>Adam didn’t hold back, slamming Nollura into any solid surface, treating her like a puppet that could break into pieces with a strong enough strike.</p><br><p>Now, achieving such control over the threads was no problem for Adam, especially when Lone Blaze helped him in dangerous moments. He was far from Gareyna’s level, but he didn’t really strive for that.</p><br><p>‘I won’t argue, it was impressive when she defeated me with the help of thread knights and guards, but… I don’t really want to rely on someone, even if they are created from my own ability.’</p><br><p>Silvana leaned forward.</p><br><p>“Adam, I think it’s time to end this. She can’t do anything against you, but she might have some trick up her sleeve to escape from here. We can’t let that happen.”</p><br><br><p>“Yes, I agree. I know what to do.”</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam raised his hands and brought them down sharply, slamming Nollura to the ground with a crash.</p><br><br><p>Her pained groan didn’t stop Adam for a moment. He pulled the threads toward him, drawing the wounded Nollura, who was struggling to understand what was happening, closer.</p><br><p>Then, when she was almost in front of him, Adam summoned his needle, directing it straight at Nollura’s neck.</p><br><p>Nollura’s eyes widened in animal fear as she hastily pulled out a black emblem.</p><br><p>Adam paid no attention to it.</p><br><p>But that was exactly what prevented him from killing her.</p><br><p>A dense, black barrier, like a raging flame, appeared in front of Nollura, blocking Adam’s needle and saving her life at the last moment.</p>
