            <br><p>Adam didn’t know all the secrets of the higher nobles and how the Twelve Branches were organized, especially such dark and bloody details as about the firstborn.
</p><br><p>However, because of the general atmosphere and Franz’s words, he roughly understood how rare yet important someone like Baren was.
</p><br><p>Every great family had a firstborn, it was inevitable as sooner or later a Phantom would appear in great families, especially considering how many people were in the same family, carrying a powerful bloodline.
</p><br><p>Read new adventures at Freewebnovel
</p><br><p>But, the same could not be said for True Firstborns. They were a rarity, in some ways much more infrequent than the Natural Phantoms, even though they were such in their origin.
</p><br><p>Adam might not be as knowledgeable about Baren’s status, but everyone here was well aware of it.
</p><br><p>It didn’t require one to be a high noble, all of the wealthy and influential enough people associated with noble society were aware of the dark ritual that actual firstborns in each great family went through.
</p><br><p>"No way... my boy..." Mariel muttered as tears spilled from her eyes.
</p><br><p>She was one of the women the current head of the Rouzet Family had slept with, so considering that it was Baren who became a firstborn, no.... a True Firstborn, it greatly affected her status, in a good way.
</p><br><p>However, although Mariel was willing to marry Osana off to another man, that didn’t mean she was a cruel, mercantile woman for whom the love and dreams of her children meant nothing.
</p><br><p>She adapted over the years to the noble society in which she, like Osana, had grown up, Mariel understood that there were rules and traditions to follow and not always it could be good news.
</p><br><p>In fact, she, like other women who gave birth to the actual firstborns, did not want to send her child to the Dead Lands, but what could she do?
</p><br><p>Running away or refusing was impossible, there was no place in the Citadel where she could hide from the gaze of the Twelve Branches. Moreover, Mariel knew from the beginning that someday that particular day would come.
</p><br><p>Back then, she didn’t think about status, influence, or anything like that, what she might obtain if her child became a True Firstborn. She was like other women, mothers in the same situation, sobbing with grief and hoping for a miracle to happen, even though she realized the chances were too slim.
</p><br><p>And... he came back.
</p><br><p>The only one who survived, the only one to become a True Firstborn in the current generation, a blessing to an entire great family.
</p><br><p>In front of Mariel’s eyes appeared a scene that was forever burned into her mind.
</p><br><p>A boy, seven years old, stood on a cold stone slab, dust running down his toes, his entire body covered in thick blood, and his always-posh pink hair, was messy and clumped together, framing his face.
</p><br><p>His gaze was no longer joyful like all children his age, it was both empty and deep, brimming with regret, and hatred... it stared directly at Mariel.
</p><br><br><p>Tears streamed from Mariel’s eyes, running down her hot cheeks, inevitably falling to the ground, crashing to the hard floor.
</p><br><p>"Is that really him...?" Zarot muttered in disbelief, trying to convince himself that his eyes were not deceiving him.
</p><br><br><p>"Why...? Why after all this time did he decide to show up only now and why in this way?"
</p><br><p>Nirosh didn’t know every member of the Rouzet Family, there were too many, but as a member of a friendly family, he just couldn’t be unaware of Baren De Rouzet, and his history.
</p><br><p>He didn’t understand the reason Baren came here, but he realized that it wasn’t a good sign for him.
</p><br><p>’No... why am I so unlucky?’ Nirosh gulped glaring at Adam, ’First, that bastard showed up and used The Rule of Power, and now...’
</p><br><p>Nirosh looked at Baren and for a moment at Gladius, ’Here comes a monster, another one... Am I cursed?’
</p><br><br><p>Osana bit down hard on her lip, so hard that a single trickle of blood poured out, but she didn’t do it because she was angry or pissed off.
</p><br><p>She was trying not to cry, not to find herself in the same position as her mother.
</p><br><p>Gladius turned, glancing around the banquet hall, enjoying the shocked looks of the guests. They seemed hypnotized, waiting for Baren to do something.
</p><br><p>And, they didn’t have long to wait.
</p><br><p>Slowly, Baren raised his head, feeling the stares on him before glancing at Mariel.
</p><br><br><p>Baren disappeared, in a heartbeat finding himself in front of Mariel, who could hardly recognize anything clearly because her eyes were drowned in tears, everything was blurry and indistinct.
</p><br><p>But, she felt, she thought, that Baren’s gaze was as cold as before, and his face devoid of emotion.
</p><br><p>With a slight wave of his hand, the tears faded from Mariel’s eyes, swept away by Baren’s fingertips.
</p><br><p>Then, Mariel clearly saw the way her son, her first child, looked at her.
</p><br><p>A joyful smile with eyes shining with delight gazed directly at her.
</p><br><p>"What...?" Mariel unconsciously muttered, not realizing what was happening. She expected something completely different from Baren... she was sure that even after all these years, he wouldn’t forgive her for what she had done.
</p><br><p>"Hi! Good to see you, Mom!" Baren exclaimed before hugging her tightly, not shy in his movements or awkwardness.
</p><br><p>He acted as any person who hadn’t seen his parents in a long time and missed them dearly would do.
</p><br><p>What was Mariel supposed to do in such a situation?
</p><br><p>Well, like any mother she forgot about everything and did what she wanted with all her heart at that moment - to hug her son tightly. It was a moment she wanted to savor forever, something she had waited for but never even hoped to get.
</p><br><p>"Baren... Let me ask you... Why did you come here today?" Mariel asked snuggling her nose into his shoulder.
</p><br><p>Then, she raised her head looking at him, waiting for an answer.
</p><br><p>Baren pointed towards the golden arch with an enthusiastic smile.
</p><br><p>"Isn’t it obvious? I’ve come to save my little sister!"</p>
