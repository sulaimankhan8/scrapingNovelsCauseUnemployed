            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1220: Unbearable Heat</strong></p><br><p>Surviving an attack by hundreds of reinforced Kirani Bugs was an impossible task for most K4-Phantoms.</p><br><p>Fromund was no exception to this rule. As soon as Moroya gave the order and reinforced the monsters, very difficult times began for him.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, he was threatened not only by the Silver Prince and his sword, but also by the many jaws and blade-like legs of the insect monsters.</p><br><p>This couldn’t go on for long.</p><br><p>In less than a minute, Fromund would lose too much blood, and even if he managed to deal with every monster, he would die from blood loss.</p><br><p>It was precisely for situations like this that it was necessary to save one’s strongest trump cards, and Fromund knew it.</p><br><p>Of all the abilities he had used during the battle, he had only one left: the Evolution Vein Order.</p><br><p>Like any K4-Phantom, he could only use this ability together with his Operator, but unlike Adam, who could already use the Evolution Vein several times per battle, Fromund was in a different situation.</p><br><p>The Evolution Vein contained a unique and powerful ability, but it was still just one of the abilities in the Phantom’s arsenal. Each ability differed from Phantom to Phantom, its power and, most importantly, its effect.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, hundreds of Kirani Bugs flew away, feeling the heat coming from Fromund. They didn’t know what was happening, just like Moroya and the Silver Prince, but soon everything became clear to everyone.</p><br><p>Arayna’s spectral form was a clear indication of what Fromund was about to do, and for Moroya, it was bad news.</p><br><p>“FUCK! Kill him, right now!” Moroya exclaimed as several amber crystals appeared next to her.</p><br><p>She tried to attack first, but it was too late.</p><br><p>The energy around Fromund became dense enough to turn into a wandering heat around him, destroying the amber rays and keeping the Kirani Bugs away.</p><br><p>It was impossible to maintain such a level of heat for long, but Fromund didn’t need much time; he only needed to make one attack.</p><br><p>“All of you…” Fromund glanced at them. “You will become nothing but nameless ashes.”</p><br><p>Fromund stretched his arm forward with his palm open.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With a tremor, a tiny orb appeared above his palm, quickly absorbing the surrounding energy and expanding like a growing star.</p><br><p>Fromund and Arayna used their energy to feed the tiny sun growing before them, to create the cruel sun and destroy all their enemies.</p><br><p>In less than ten seconds, the flame orb the size of a seed turned into a massive sun dozens of times larger than Fromund himself.</p><br><p>Unlike his usual active and excited expression, his gaze was now calm, as he knew what fate awaited anyone who dared to stand in his way.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the instincts of all the monsters reached their limit, causing them to flee from the unstoppable force that would inevitably overtake each of them.</p><br><p>At that moment, they were simply unable to think rationally or make a plan. All they wanted was to survive, and their minds were powerless to resist their instincts.</p><br><p>Even Moroya and the Silver Prince were no exception. Something ancient awakened within them when they saw the full majesty of the cruel sun.</p><br><p>They directed all their strength toward defense.</p><br><p>“I must stop this, or else… I will become nothing!” Moroya cried out inwardly, gathering all her strength to create a protective barrier as hundreds of Kirani Bugs flew in all directions.</p><br><p>In an instant, the whole world seemed to stop as Fromund’s words echoed throughout the colony.</p><br><br><p>Then, the cruel sun shone brightly, releasing an explosion as destructive and vicious as Fromund’s sun.</p><br><p>For a moment, a bright flash erupted from the depths, outshining even the light of the stars covering the Corrupted Volcano lands.</p><br><p>A deafening explosion tore chunks of earth, sending debris the size of rocks flying upward, leaving nothing around the cruel sun intact.</p><br><p>The satellites hovering high above the sky struggled to remain operational, and even their cold frames grew hot as they watched the fiery stream erupt from the ground during the explosion.</p><br><p>Naturally, the Kirani Bugs, no matter how powerful they were, were reduced to ash in the first fraction of a second of the explosion. The shockwave simply blew them away, leaving the fire to do the rest.</p><br><p>The Silver Prince managed to withstand the shockwave; it did not tear him apart, but as soon as the flames reached him, his body was burned faster than he could even think about it.</p><br><p>Nothing could stand before the cruel sun, not hundreds of Black Threat Monsters, not the meters of rock and earth surrounding Fromund. Everything around him turned into scorched earth covered with smoldering embers.</p><br><br><p>Fromund collapsed to one knee, breathing heavily while Arayna’s silhouette scattered into many fragments.</p><br><br><p>Everything before Fromund’s eyes blurred. He struggled to remain conscious after such a massive loss of energy.</p><br><p>“Hah, at least now it’s over…” Fromund croaked as he raised his head, only to see his eyes widen in disbelief.</p><br><p>With legs trembling from pain, Moroya managed to remain standing in her spot. Her left arm was gone, and her side was covered in a thick black crust of burnt flesh and chitin, as was half of her face.</p><br><p>However, using all the strength she had left, she managed to survive. Only her skill in creating protective barriers and the enormous amount of energy she had managed to accumulate before the battle began made this possible.</p><br><p>“No… How can this be…?” Fromund muttered with a trembling gaze.</p><br><p>Moroya spat out a clot of blood as her gaze turned to the side.</p><br><p>Behind the stone throne was one of the remaining Twilight Crystals. If she absorbed it, she would not only survive but also win. There was no doubt about that.</p><br><p>In a panic, Fromund tried to get up and catch up with her. He had to stop Moroya while he still had a chance.</p><br><br><p>Fromund hadn’t even taken his first step when he collapsed to the ground. He was too exhausted.</p><br><p>All he could do was watch as Moroya slowly moved toward the throne.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, a shadow appeared out of nowhere, rushing past Moroya.</p><br><p>“Agh…?” Moroya’s eyes flew open.</p><br><p>Then, Marhen grabbed her by the head and, with a swift movement, broke her neck, ending the life of the Kirani Queen.</p>
