            <br><p>"Speaking of my style." Silvana muttered, slowly raising her eyes to Adam, "If you want I can bring back the disheveled hairstyle like during my punishment. It was an interesting experience to admit, no one has ever ordered me how I should look before."</p><br><p>There was no resentment or displeasure in Silvana's voice, instead only mild interest in what Adam would do if he had the desire, but... only she thought so.</p><br><p>Sensing her calm, even as he considered her cold gaze, Adam smiled awkwardly and scratched the back of his head.</p><br><br><p>Adam cast a sidelong glance.</p><br><p>"I was acting on emotion at the time. I don't want to control you, especially in small things like clothes and style."</p><br><p>Without saying anything, Silvana stood up looking at him from bottom to top because of their height difference, but thanks to her sly smirk her gaze towered over him.</p><br><p>"Really? You know, I'm an obedient Operator, I can look any way you want me to. What's more... I don't even know your preference for a girl's appearance."</p><br><br><p>Silvana ran her fingers over his chest, pressing lightly. It had been only one day since Adam had woken up, just yesterday he and Fromund had been emptying the medical department buffet.</p><br><p>But... in that short period of time, something changed in Silvana. She become more confident and assertive.</p><br><p>A wave of embarrassment swept over Adam, about to reveal a shy blush on his cheeks, yet in an instant everything changed.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes intently staring at Silvana.</p><br><p>"Hey, stop kidding around. I'm serious about getting back to work."</p><br><p>For a few seconds, Silvana's face froze, then a slight smile turned wide when she laughed:</p><br><p>"Hahahahahahahaha, sorry, I just thought I'd tease you a little. I hope you won't take offense to that?"</p><br><p>Silvana leaned forward, keeping her arms folded behind her back.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, trying to figure out what Silvana was thinking right now.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, a black car pulled up next to the park.</p><br><p>They didn't pay attention to it, since now and then, even in quiet places like this park, someone would come to rest.</p><br><p>But... soon they had to turn around.</p><br><p>A girl of medium height with blonde curly hair framing her face was heading towards them. Her calm blue eyes were filled with wisdom and knowledge, even though she looked young, like a student in one of the last years of some prestigious university. Enjoy new chapters from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>It was a remote part of the Third Ring, a quiet, unremarkable park, but she was wearing a long white coat and tall black shoes, she tried to seem much taller than she really was.</p><br><p>Stopping in front of Adam and Silvana, the girl glanced at them. She didn't bow or show any respect, nor did she do the opposite.</p><br><p>"Hello. I hope I haven't distracted you."</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana glanced over at each other. They were not familiar with this girl.</p><br><p>"My name is Stina, I am one of the scientists working at the Iron Observatory. I have some important business to attend to."</p><br><p>The girl's words made their eyes grow wide for a moment. Neither Adam nor Silvana had ever been at the Iron Observatory, but after the battle against the Plague Reaper, they learned about how Nessa showed up there despite the black clouds full of plague.</p><br><p>All of this came from the Iron Observatory, whose chief scientist was known for her technological developments that occasionally added to the military's arsenal. It was an enhancement not only for the military, but also for the Harvesters, and could indirectly help the Phantoms due to mobility and utility.</p><br><p>"Iron Observatory..." Adam muttered.</p><br><p>He remembered well his arrival at the Miracle Observatory where Magnus was in charge, there he not only healed his arm but learned about the only hybrid, Nessa, as well as her past.</p><br><p>Stina's lips slowly parted.</p><br><p>"Yes. Mr. Adam Vinter, I know you plan to return to the Dead Lands. It's your job to kill monsters, but as a K2-Phantom you have a right to learn about things that were previously unavailable to you."</p><br><p>Before they could answer anything, Stina shifted her gaze to Silvana, staring at her intently as if she were her opponent.</p><br><p>"The same goes for you, Silvana Desio. You are now Operator of the K2-Phantom, and are now eligible to visit the Iron Observatory for a special procedure."</p><br><p>Quickly shifting her gaze to Adam, Stina continued:</p><br><p>"However, it is up to you to decide whether you will do it now or later and whether you will do it at all."</p><br><p>Confusion was all Adam and Silvana felt. They already knew a lot about the Citadel, Dead Lands, and power levels, especially Silvana, yet every word of Stina's was like a complex riddle that made no sense to them.</p><br><p>Adam ran a hand across his neck, gazing at Stina with a lost look.</p><br><p>"Wait... could you at least explain what you're talking about? And... what is this procedure that requires a Phantom and an Operator? This whole thing sounds kind of weird."</p><br><p>Remaining silent for a few seconds, Stina nodded slightly.</p><br><p>"Sure, but I have no right to tell you anything before you agree and before you arrive at the Iron Observatory. It's a secret that ranks higher than the existence of the Natural Phantoms since only K2-Phantoms and above should be aware of it."</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes. She didn't like this situation at all. She was used to always solving problems for Adam related to information and documents, but... now she didn't know any more than he did. It annoyed her and deep inside scared her.</p><br><p>"Hey, if you want us to agree then give some explanation. You don't have to tell us secrets, you have no right to, but you can give us hints, at least a glimpse so we understand the gravity of the situation."</p><br><p>"Oh, Adam Vinter, your Operator is quite strict, and... it is unknown whether that is good or bad."</p><br><p>At the same moment, Stina's eyes grew deeper, dark as wise sapphires.</p><br><p>"Sooner or later every Phantom has to go through this if he didn't die and managed to make it to K2. But, often Operators turn out to be unprepared, simply unfit."</p><br><p>Then, she shifted her gaze to Silvana. Answering her question:</p><br><p>"If you fail, it could destroy your shared destiny, ruining your relationship as Phantom and Operator - forever."</p><br><p>"Are you satisfied with the answer?" Stina asked.</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip.</p><br><p>"Yes, quite enough."</p>
