            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1180: Obsidian Guard (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Now, Adam and Fromund were much stronger than they had been a few months ago when they fought at the Rule of Power. However, they couldn’t be called weak even at that moment.</p><br><p>After all, they were among the strongest of the K2-Phantoms, and their skills were recognized even by powerful individuals such as Erik Wurhen and Kogen Noukx.</p><br><p>Like Adam, Fromund had many abilities. One of the most memorable was summoning a huge meteor, which Adam had a hard time dealing with at the time.</p><br><p>Over time, some of the Phantom’s abilities disappeared, others changed dramatically, but some abilities only became better and more powerful, largely retaining their former appearance.</p><br><p>It wasn’t always the same ability. Everything was unique to each Phantom, and the final result depended on their choices, desires, and Initial Gene.</p><br><p>Summoning meteors was one of the abilities that only grew stronger over time without undergoing any major changes.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s eyes were wide open as he watched dozens of meteors moving straight toward the volcano beasts.</p><br><p>Soon, the first meteors cut through the dark clouds, leaving red trails stretching behind them like threads.</p><br><p>“Holy shit. Why are there so many of them?!” Adam exclaimed in disbelief.</p><br><p>He remembered well that Fromund could only summon one meteor before. Sure, it was bigger than these, the size of the Moon Colosseum arena, but the current number and the flames coming from each meteor made this ability much more deadly.</p><br><br><p>Fromund laughed when the first monsters noticed the bright dots in the night sky.</p><br><p>“What did you expect to see? That weak, lonely meteor I used against you? That was a long time ago! I’m much stronger now! I’m sure your abilities have changed much more than mine!”</p><br><p>Adam couldn’t argue with that. Since their battle, all of his abilities had undergone significant changes. The only thing that remained unchanged was his needles, although even they were nothing like the simple needles he had fought with before.</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam’s curiosity was piqued.</p><br><p>‘I wonder what kind of Evolution Vein he has. It must be something that connects him and Arayna. Something that brings his abilities to their peak.’</p><br><p>Adam hadn’t worked with anyone on a team in a long time. The last time was at the Fortress of Lone Serpent, although he had avoided it until the very last moment. However, in the end, he and Katrin joined forces against the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>He had yet to see other Phantoms use their abilities in conjunction with their Operators.</p><br><p>Tremble! Tremble! Tremble!</p><br><p>At the same time, the meteors reached the ground, destroying one volcano beast after another. Like real cannons, they were immobile and even clumsy, struggling to run down the hillside.</p><br><p>However, most of them would not survive under any scenario.</p><br><p>Fromund spent quite a lot of energy on this attack, but that was not a problem for him.</p><br><p>He went on this mission to the Corrupted Volcano not only because he, like Adam, needed to find the Twilight Crystal to progress further.</p><br><p>For him, it was the perfect battlefield. There weren’t many strong individuals here like there were at the Corrosive Lakes with Dayra and Kolos, but hundreds of weaker monsters literally filled these lands of soot.</p><br><br><p>Fiery explosions scattered pieces of earth in all directions, tearing the volcano beasts to pieces.</p><br><p>As a result, after just one attack, less than half of the volcano beasts remained.</p><br><p>The results were immediately apparent — the number of Kirani Bugs had increased significantly. With every passing second, new figures appeared on the horizon, quickly approaching the battlefield.</p><br><p>“Yes! Now everything is going according to plan! Let those bugs take the core, and we’ll follow them! I’m sure the Twilight Crystals are in their nest!”</p><br><p>Adam nodded, keeping his composure. They had no guarantees, but it was their best option.</p><br><p>However, Adam soon realized that by killing the volcano beasts, they had made a mistake.</p><br><p>They had freed the obsidian golems that were under constant fire. Their bodies were strong enough to withstand multiple projectiles, but this prevented them from advancing toward the core.</p><br><p>But that wasn’t a problem anymore.</p><br><p>“Fuck! Fromund, look!” Adam exclaimed, pointing to one obsidian golem that had managed to reach the core faster than the others.</p><br><p>The golem was missing its right arm, its shoulder melted from the heat of the shells, but its stride was steady.</p><br><p>The Kirani Bugs accelerated sharply, their wings moving at full speed to catch up and stop the golem, but it was too late.</p><br><br><p>Without wasting a moment, the obsidian golem struck the core directly, causing all the energy to burst out in chaotic streams.</p><br><p>The energy quickly found a place where it could direct all its power into the wounded but determined obsidian golem.</p><br><p>A bright flash covered the dark field, forcing Adam and Fromund, who were watching from afar, to squint.</p><br><p>The other obsidian golems collapsed to their knees due to the overwhelming aura emanating from one of their kin. The only ones unaffected by the flash were the Kirani Bugs.</p><br><p>A bloodthirsty gleam ran across their blades as they pounced on the obsidian golem. His frame was hidden behind bright streams of energy swirling around him in a wild vortex.</p><br><p>Adam and Fromund watched intently, waiting for the Kirani Bugs to finish off the obsidian golem in the final moments. After all, evolution took time. The process was different for each monster, but it couldn’t happen in the blink of an eye.</p><br><br><p>The wide blade of the red-hot axe sliced through the squad of Kirani Bugs that had flown too close.</p><br><p>The wind from a single swing swept toward the tops of the nearest hills, toward the remaining volcano beasts and Adam with Fromund.</p><br><p>Soot mixed with ash followed the wind before settling on the hot ground next to the bubbling lava.</p><br><p>Adam blinked to see more than ten Kirani Bugs at the monster’s feet in dark, heavy stone armor holding flaming axes.</p><br><p>Time was short, but there was enough energy from the core for the obsidian golem to evolve into the obsidian guard.</p>
