            <br><br><p>This ability Phantom gained regardless of how he chose to open the door after opening the first keyhole in his Lock, creating his First Key.</p><br><p>It was an inevitable enhancement after the development of the Initial Gene.</p><br><p>For the most part, the Initial Order was Phantom's most straightforward ability. It reflected his essence, what the monster he absorbed would be capable of if it could get to the same stage of evolution.</p><br><p>Obviously, in Adam's case, it was simple thread control.</p><br><p>True, this was only the beginning. If he could someday fully control all of his threads, he would become a truly formidable creature that no one could even come close to.</p><br><p>But, by nature, they were just strong, sharp silver threads.</p><br><p>That was the essence of the Initial Order - simplicity and great potential.</p><br><p>Sure, there were always exceptions to the rule, but this was the most common.</p><br><p>And... Fromund was in the same situation.</p><br><p>A bright flaming circle hovering behind his back like the halo of an evil sun attracted the attention of all the spectators.</p><br><p>Flame streams emanating from the circle like ropes of fire traveled down his arms, turning into active flows ready to unleash their full power at any moment.</p><br><p>Even though the barrier blocked all the energy coming from the arena, the spectators could still feel the active heat from the slowly rotating circle behind Fromund.</p><br><p>But, they were behind the barrier while Adam was a few meters away from Fromund. An unpleasant sensation passed over his skin as if he was too close to the fire, but without direct contact, Fromund couldn't burn him.</p><br><p>"I must admit, that flame circle looks impressive and threatening..."</p><br><p>Adam raised his hand, pointing to the active flames surrounding Fromund, his voice was low and cold.</p><br><p>In response, Fromund only shrugged, a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Come on. This is my Initial Order, you have the threads and I just have the flames. Should K2-Phantom be afraid of some weak flame?"</p><br><br><p>Without waiting for an answer, Fromund stepped forward putting his hands in front of him. Explore stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>His fingertips touched each other while his thumbs were down, creating an empty space between his palms.</p><br><br><p>The red circle trembled, flames swirled filling the void between Fromund's hands, creating a fire veil.</p><br><p>Preparing for the attack took Fromund only a few seconds and that was the maximum amount of time Adam intended to be careful.</p><br><p>Not wanting to know what would happen when Fromund finished his attack, Adam swung his arms, bringing the threads down on Fromund.</p><br><p>The silver threads like two predatory snakes moved straight towards Fromund, parting the air currents, a deadly weapon ready to kill its target, but... it was too late.</p><br><p>'Adam, you've waited too long.' Arayna thought, the corners of her lips unconsciously lifting.</p><br><p>The threads needed to be dodged, but Fromund didn't budge, he only took a deep breath, his lungs expanding to their limit.</p><br><br><p>Whoooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>In a single movement, Fromund released all the accumulated air, with a force no less than a furious vortex, his cheeks puffed wide.</p><br><p>It was just pressurized air, but... its path passed through the flaming veil between his hands.</p><br><p>Fear mixed with shock filled Adam's eyes as he muttered quietly:</p><br><p>Like the breath of an ancient dragon, a massive stream of flame crashed into the silver threads, filling most of the arena.</p><br><p>Adam was at the edge of the arena, far away from Fromund, but that didn't save him from the fire breath coming straight at him like an avalanche.</p><br><p>Oddly enough... this was no problem for the silver threads. Because of how voluminous the flame stream was, the average temperature wasn't as high as it could have been under pressure.</p><br><p>Thus, once Adam jerked his hands as the threads returned to him, shortening to their limit, barely reaching his fingers.</p><br><p>"You can breathe fire after all, even though you assured me otherwise." Adam shook his head with a bitter smile.</p><br><p>Despite the increasing heat and the impending flames from which he had nowhere to escape, Adam remained calm.</p><br><p>He only cast a glance at his threads before nodding deeply.</p><br><p>"Well, though I did not deceive you, unlike your Initial Order, I did not show you the full power of mine."</p><br><p>Confidence was evident in his gaze directed at the fire that was only a few meters away from him. A few more seconds and the flames would completely engulf him, dooming him to gruesome burns and serious injuries.</p><br><p>"Fire is indeed a formidable force, but... though it tries to hide behind aggression, it's obvious to everyone how fragile flames are. All you have to do is break it into several pieces, and make it lose most of its powers."</p><br><p>At the same moment, a silver ring of dense energy appeared on each of Adam's fingers, then five threads emerged from each ring. They were much thinner than when there were only two, but their sharpness and most importantly their speed remained the same.</p><br><p>"Yeah... I don't know how to control them, but... when the target is that big everything changes. It's like attacking a huge wall - you can't miss."</p><br><p>The corners of his lips went up - forming a sly grin like a child who found a way to cheat and do something previously impossible.</p><br><br><p>Tensing his fingers like a mysterious puppeteer, Adam raised his hands before swinging them in different directions.</p><br><p>Fifty threads received their first direction, but that was only the beginning.</p><br><p>Not wanting to stop, Adam swung his arms a few more times in chaotic directions without thinking about the consequences.</p><br><p>No matter where the threads headed or under what trajectory, he would still hit his target.</p><br><p>'Hahaha! Damn! I'm just doing what I want! This is so cool!'</p><br><p>Delight filled Adam's wide-open eyes as he raised his arms high with one last swing, wanting to turn the flaming breath into nothing more than harmless wisps of fire.</p><br><p>He got the chance to use all his threads and nothing was stopping him from doing it!</p>
