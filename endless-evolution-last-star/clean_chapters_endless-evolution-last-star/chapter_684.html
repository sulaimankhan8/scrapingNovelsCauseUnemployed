            <br><p>’Adam... Be careful, there are more and more monsters...’ Silvana muttered in a trembling voice. Explore hidden tales at NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>She could see the Shadow Walkers and the Dark Watchers appearing from the passageways, she was sure it wouldn’t be long before they caused Adam trouble.
</p><br><p>However, her warning only elicited a slight smile from Adam.
</p><br><p>"Oh, I don’t think you need to worry about them. They won’t attack, not me or my serious opponent, that would be against the rules."
</p><br><p>’Hmm? What are you talking about? Do you think that the light around the arena will stop them?’ Silvana frowned, she was displeased at how careless Adam was, being on a dangerous mission all alone.
</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, one of the Shadow Walkers stepped forward, only one foot crossing the boundary. It was unknown why the monster did this, whether out of curiosity or because he wanted to get energy from the slabs, but it was a big mistake.
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, purple thunder flew out of the sphere, raining down on the weak monster. Before the Shadow Walker could realize anything, it was reduced to a handful of smoking ash.
</p><br><p>"Hah, there’s your answer. They came here because it’s their opportunity to get something at the end when only one of us is left, but for now, I shouldn’t worry about them."
</p><br><br><p>With a whoosh of wind, a tall shadow fell over Adam, covering half of his face.
</p><br><p>Silvana gasped, about to warn Adam, but it was too late, the massive spear was moving straight towards him, from bottom to top.
</p><br><p>However... Adam had been expecting this movement for quite some time. The corners of his lips lifted upwards as white particles flashed before his eyes at the last moment.
</p><br><br><p>The crimson blade slammed into the silver needle, yet the force of the impulse was enough to throw Adam aside.
</p><br><p>He could have slowed down and easily regained his balance, but he purposely didn’t do that since he wanted to see the rules.
</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Adam calmly flew onward upon reaching the barrier, finding himself among the bewildered Shadow Walkers and Dark Watchers.
</p><br><p>"Oh, so there are no boundaries for the fighters, but there are for you guys, right?" Adam muttered looking back at the monsters.
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, realizing that the defenseless Phantom was in front of them, the monsters pounced on Adam, but he just jumped up, dodging the combined attack.
</p><br><p>Looking at the monsters crashing into each other, Adam smiled, fooling them was very easy.
</p><br><p>However, his joy didn’t last long.
</p><br><p>Adam’s mouth opened wide as his face turned pale.
</p><br><br><p>A red flash like a bright star appeared at the tip of the spear, making the twisted blade shudder, scarlet ripples passed forward, faster and faster.
</p><br><p>Then, the Solitary Commander pointed the spear slightly upwards, causing all the unstable energy to burst out in a single launch.
</p><br><p>The fiery ray as dense and hot as the wrath of the sun, raced towards Adam at high speed, the air shuddering unable to withstand the temperature, warping space like a mirage in the desert.
</p><br><p>Adam had less than a second to think. He had to do something. Because of his position, he couldn’t dodge the ray, so his only option was to respond with an equally powerful attack.
</p><br><p>’Shit, I didn’t think I’d have to use it this early, but it looks like I have no other choice.’
</p><br><p>Black electrical discharges flashed before Adam’s eyes, the energy inside him boiling up in a powerful current.
</p><br><br><br><p>Suddenly, something squeezed Adam by the ankle, pulling him down with great desire. Oddly enough, this saved him, as he was now out of the ray’s trajectory.
</p><br><p>Completely baffled by what had happened, Adam looked up, the hot ray swept right over him reflecting in his confused blue eyes.
</p><br><br><p>Adam fell to the ground, glaring at the random Shadow Walker who was greedily holding his leg.
</p><br><p>"You... What the fuck..."
</p><br><p>Then, a fiery ray reached the nearest peak, crashing into the rugged rock that Adam had barely made crack with his punch.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The shudder spread through the fortress in a bright amber flash, blinding a dozen monsters too close to the epicenter.
</p><br><p>The flaming blast shattered the wall’s top into large pieces of rubble, scattering clots of hot magma across the area.
</p><br><p>The first few shockwaves burned the Shadow Walkers and the Dark Watchers standing by the passageways, leaving nothing but charred flesh.
</p><br><p>The possibility of being next in their place caused the monsters to scurry away, as far away from the ruined wall and Adam as possible. Most of the monsters moved to the left edge of the arena, where the Solitary Commander was.
</p><br><p>’Adam! Are you alright?!’ Silvana exclaimed worried lest the flames leave severe burns on his back.
</p><br><p>However, Adam didn’t immediately respond, instead he slowly stood up and turned his gaze not on the Solitary Commander but on the crowd of monsters.
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, he spotted the very same Shadow Walker who dragged him down.
</p><br><p>"Obviously you did it because you just wanted to get to me, but... your stupidity actually saved me. No matter what happens, I won’t kill you, if you can survive to the end of course."
</p><br><br><p>Paying no further attention to the useless onlookers, Adam walked back to the square, meeting the Solitary Commander’s gaze.
</p><br><p>The crimson plates were slightly melted at his right wrist, but that was all the damage the Solitary Commander had received for launching such a devastating blast.
</p><br><p>"I see... The Wild Lands is no joke at all. I won’t be modest though. Most of the K2W0-Phantoms in my place would be dead by now, the pure destructive power that the creatures in this fortress possess is simply abnormal."
</p><br><p>’Yes.’ Silvana nodded deeply, ’After all, this is the Red Zone, I think you should try to dodge attacks to drain the Solitary Commander.’
</p><br><p>She was about to continue, but Adam’s gruff voice interrupted her.
</p><br><p>"Silvana, from now until the end of the fight, not another fucking word. It’s just me and him here, no one else."
</p><br><br><p>Not going to wait for her reaction, Adam stepped forward swinging his needle, the sharp tip leaving a long cut on the ground, shards flying off to the sides.
</p><br><p>Then, his eyes traveled to his weapon.
</p><br><p>"All I want now is to see his brazen head impaled on my needle!"
</p><br><br><p>Solitary Commander let out a short but satisfied wheeze.
</p><br><p>They clearly understood each other’s desires.</p>
