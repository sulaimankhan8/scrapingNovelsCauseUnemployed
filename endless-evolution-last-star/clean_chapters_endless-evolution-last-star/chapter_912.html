            <br><p>The story of the Twilight Palace that continued to Erik's estate had come to an end. As soon as the training and the last meal were over, all six of them went outside, where two cars were waiting for them.</p><br><p>Unlike the military black cars, these were elite sports cars, worth millions of credits and produced in limited editions.</p><br><p>Reinz and Chloe followed Julia, who was heading towards the gray car, while Adam and Silvana followed Erik to the crimson one.</p><br><p>Before getting into the seats, Adam and Reinz turned to each other and exchanged a handshake.</p><br><p>"Thank you... For helping in so many ways..." Reinz muttered, a slight smile on his face, "When we fought at the Twilight Palace, I had no idea where this would lead."</p><br><p>"Hah." Adam laughed briefly. "I'm sorry for scaring your family members and for ruining the lake. I hope everything will be fine."</p><br><p>"Don't worry." Reinz scratched the back of his head. "I think my family had everything back in place the next day."</p><br><p>Then, he looked intently at Adam, with complete seriousness.</p><br><p>"I hope we meet again, Adam Vinter. If you need anything, feel free to ask, I'm sure I can help you."</p><br><p>In response, Adam patted him on the shoulder. "Good to know. When you reach a K4-Level, then I'll have the opportunity to ask one of the elders of the first great family for help, am I right?"</p><br><p>"W-Well..." Reinz awkwardly looked away. "It won't be easy, but I hope I can do it."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply and got into the car.</p><br><p>He'd been in a luxury sports car once before - when he'd performed three Osana's wishes that eventually led to The Rule of Power. But, Erik's car was on a whole other level.</p><br><p>'Damn...' Adam looked around. 'Not that I have much interest in cars, but I just can't deny that it looks cool...'</p><br><p>Erik put his coat aside and gripped the steering wheel.</p><br><p>"Alright, Julia will take Reinz and Julia to the platform to reach Heaven Island and gradually the Void Lake. We, in turn, will travel to your original home, Adam."</p><br><p>"Argh...?" Adam tilted his head in confusion. "We're going to the slums? Isn't the descent at the Lower Ring located there?"</p><br><p>"Well, practically. There are many places where you can get to the Lower Ring, such places are called - the Hollow Spots. One of them is at the Ninth Ring, under the control of the Noukx Family, but... we're not going there." Erik smirked before stepping on the gas, bringing the car into motion.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam and Silvana were pressed into the seats, the speed and acceleration of the car being much faster than they had expected.</p><br><p>"But..." Adam muttered, looking at the buildings flashing outside the windows, "Aren't you on good terms with Kogen Noukx? Why don't we use the Hollow Spot on his land?"</p><br><p>"Because it could be dangerous for you."</p><br><p>Erik explained, descending into a secret tunnel beneath the city where he could ride directly through all the rings.</p><br><p>"There aren't many of the Hollow Spots in the Citadel - there are only two located at the First Ring. One is at the ninth wing, it's usually used by strong Phantoms and higher nobles, though it's rare. The second Hollow Spot is on the government grounds at the First Wing. Apparently, it is used by government representatives, the highest-ranking members.</p><br><p>"Officially, there is no government at the Lower Ring, and to a large extent, that is true. The government doesn't control what is going on down there, except for a few special things... Usually, the top of the Upper Ring and the Lower Ring agree on basic things. Other than that, the government doesn't care what happens down below."</p><br><p>Erik's grin grew wider as the platform lowered, opening up a seemingly endless tunnel in front of them - it would lead them right to the border of the Third Ring.</p><br><p>"The Hollow Spot at the First Wing doesn't work for us, you're not a government representative, nor do I. The spot at the ninth wing is out too, if you go through it you could be in serious trouble - so we'll head for the border between the Third Ring and the slums."</p><br><p>"The border...?" Adam was puzzled. "Has the path at the Lower Ring been this close to my house all along?"</p><br><p>"Well... It depends." Erik shrugged nonchalantly as he continued to pick up speed. "You'd never be allowed at the Hollow Spots even if you happened to find the place. There are a total of four the Hollow Spots on the border between the third ring and the slums, we're heading towards the northern one.</p><br><p>"There are only four more Hollow Spots in the Citadel, two between the Second and the Third Ring, and two more between the Second Ring and the First Ring."</p><br><p>Silvana muttered to herself, counting quickly, "So... So there are only ten places in the entire Citadel from where you can get to the Lower Ring, right?"</p><br><p>"Exactly, but..." Erik nodded, a dangerous glint running across his eyes, "This is the Citadel we're talking about. At the Dead Lands, there are enough hidden paths from where the so-called Dark Phantoms can emerge."</p><br><p>Silvana turned to Adam, his eyes immediately becoming as cold as glaciers.</p><br><p>"Yeah... I remember that very well." Adam wheezed.</p><br><p>He had faced Phantoms from the Lower Ring, and every time, it had ended in multiple deaths on both sides.</p><br><p>"They'd just appear out of nowhere. I don't know where their passageways are, but I'm sure they're well hidden."</p><br><p>"It's just as you say." Erik confirmed. "Furthermore, don't forget about the Bastions. Though you have no reason to go there yet, the Bastions are connected not only to the Upper Ring but to the Lower Ring as well.</p><br><p>"Anyway. We're moving to the border of the Third Ring because I think it's the best place for you - K3-Phantom. You won't be in the center and can start at the edge, gradually moving towards your goal.</p><br><p>"I'm sure you're wondering where the Hollow Spots are, after all, you've lived in slums all your life. Well, you'll see it all soon enough. We don't have more than ten minutes left."</p><br><p>Then, Erik pressed a button, causing his car to accelerate even more, turning into a crimson flash.</p>
