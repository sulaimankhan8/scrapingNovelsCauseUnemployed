            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1500: New Lands (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Every person, without exception, whether a commoner, a soldier, or a Phantom, knew that the Dead Lands surrounded the Citadel.</p><br><p>In people’s minds, the Dead Lands were a deadly place, which was true. It was a region that stretched to the edge of the world, with countless monsters and threats even to strong Phantoms.</p><br><p>Well, not that it changed anything for ordinary people, but that understanding of the Dead Lands was not correct.</p><br><p>As a Phantom grew stronger, he learned that the Dead Lands were divided into the Pacific Lands and the Wild Lands. Despite its name, the far reaches of the Pacific Lands were far more dangerous than the territories near the walls of the Citadel.</p><br><p>However, neither the Pacific Lands nor the Wild Lands that made up the Dead Lands were the greatest threat to humanity.</p><br><p>The strongest monsters that inhabited the Dead Lands, that is, the distant parts of the Wild Lands, were the Black Threat Level Monsters.</p><br><p>Sure, one such monster could easily kill dozens or hundreds of Phantoms if they were weaker, but it still wasn’t the Lord realm of power. And as was known, not all Lords were equal among themselves, far from it.</p><br><p>Unless something unusual happened, it was impossible to encounter a Lord in the Dead Lands, in any part of it.</p><br><p>One of the reasons for this, oddly enough, was Frida.</p><br><p>If she saw that some low-rank Lord had decided to leave the Dark Shore and attack a K4-Phantom or even a K3 one, then that Lord would not live long.</p><br><p>What about stronger Lords?</p><br><p>Well, there was no reason for them to attack such weak Phantoms. It wasn’t worth their time, and even if they were stronger than low-rank Lords, the question remained: How much stronger were they?</p><br><p>After all, Frida was one of the strongest Phantoms. No one wanted to go against her, especially when she had the territorial advantage.</p><br><p>She was located on Azure Island, right above Heaven Island, where Queen Elisa herself was. From this position, she could attack anyone who came within her range and posed a threat to humanity.</p><br><p>Then, when a Phantom took the next step toward power, it learned of the existence of the Tarnished Lands. Adam had arrived at the Dark Shore earlier, but his situation was an exception due to the First Star’s intervention.</p><br><p>The Tarnished Lands were located west of the Citadel and were much less explored than the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>On the opposite side of the Tarnished Lands, to the east, was the Dark Shore.</p><br><p>Only the strongest Phantoms who had reached the upper threshold of power could afford to travel these lands, fight, and win.</p><br><p>But… was that all there was to this world?</p><br><p>We weren’t talking about the Lower Ring, which was also home to dangerous monsters, but it was a fairly small area compared to the Dark Shore and Tarnished Lands.</p><br><p>Well, it was time for Adam, Alexia, and the others to learn more about it.</p><br><p>“New lands?” Adam asked, not yet fully understanding what Damien was talking about.</p><br><p>The others looked at him with puzzled faces, waiting for an answer.</p><br><p>Damien nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“Based on what you’ve told us, the place you’re about to go is definitely in the Primal Lands.”</p><br><p>Alexia and Adam exchanged glances. They had never heard of it.</p><br><p>They knew about the Dark Shote and Tarnished Lands, the most powerful factions that basically controlled the entire power dynamic of the world. Still, the Primal Lands remained unknown to them.</p><br><p>“I understand your surprise, but there’s nothing unusual about that. Until a K4-Phantom has created at least the First Grand Star, even approaching the border of the Primal Lands is too dangerous for him. It’s a wild place where you must act not as warriors or killers to survive, but as hunters.”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam and Alexia just smiled. They still knew too little about the Primal Lands, but it was enough for them to understand the gist.</p><br><p>“There are a lot of wild monsters there, right?” Adam asked.</p><br><br><p>“Not only wild ones, but something you’ve hardly ever encountered before.”</p><br><p>Beth crossed her arms over her chest.</p><br><p>“There are a large, I would say record number of ancient monsters waiting for you there. Well, to some extent, it is because of them, the raging energy, and the wild nature that this region got its name.”</p><br><p>Silvana tilted her head.</p><br><br><br><p>“Yes, monsters that have lived for hundreds of years and whose bodies have been imbued with powerful energy that would be deadly to other monsters from most regions. The oldest of them has been alive for several thousand years.”</p><br><p>She narrowed her eyes, staring intently at Adam, as if he should know something about it.</p><br><p>“Perhaps some of you have already been to places where these monsters once fought or died. The first encounter with such ancient energy must be something memorable.”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam remembered something.</p><br><p>The Silver Beacon, or more precisely, the Hollow Spire Island, where he found the Desire of Beyond.</p><br><p>When he saw Bertrada’s memories of the past, he saw fragments indicating a fierce battle in which Bertrada was weak and helpless. The White Spire, the Ancient Artifact, died in battle against a formidable monster, which was destroyed during the fight by an unknown person.</p><br><p>Adam remembered it clearly because the aura of this human was unlike anything he had encountered before.</p><br><p>‘So, an Ancient Monster is capable of something like that?’ He thought as a shiver ran through his body.</p><br><p>Alexia’s face paled as well. It seemed that there was a similar situation in her story.</p><br><p>“Oh, what’s wrong with your faces?” Beth raised an eyebrow. “You can relax, you won’t have to fight anyone that strong. What you saw were the strongest and oldest monsters, many of which live in the Primal Lands. You’re unlikely to encounter any of them.”</p><br><p>“This…” Adam muttered. “That’s both scary and makes my heart beat faster.”</p><br><p>Alexia nodded. “Yeah, same. We don’t have any other choice but to go to the Primal Lands anyway, right?”</p><br><br><p>“Of course! It will be a long journey so we will help you!”</p>
