            <br><br><p>Making the ground tremble and burning rusty dust, Firebreathing Trinadon gradually approached the Light Rain squad. Its appearance was menacing, and its aura was ready to suppress any Phantom.</p><br><p>Since it was a Prime Type, Iren and her squad paid great attention to the monster's extra saws and took advantage of the fact that Prime Firebreathing Trinadons were always loners.</p><br><p>However... They forgot that Prime Types were the supreme members of their species, possessing supreme physical stats and naturally wielding all the abilities that other Firebreathing Trinadons might not have been capable of.</p><br><br><p>Adam jumped down from Iron Beacon, holding a silver needle. He couldn't sustain a fall from such a height without seriously injuring himself - he should have come down gradually, but he didn't have time for that.</p><br><p>So Adam's gaze was directed to the top of the beacon, as he threw the needle forward with a sharp motion, letting it pierce the iron sheets and catch on them like a hook.</p><br><p>There was no opportunity for Adam to swing for a long jump since the connecting thread was sharp, unlike the ordinary rope, and easily cut through the iron plates.</p><br><p>"Fine, that will be enough." Adam muttered before pulling himself up to the beacon and starting to run along it like some kind of ant capable of walking on walls - the needle holding him up.</p><br><p>Then, descending as low as he could, Adam jumped to the top of the nearest building, doing a somersault.</p><br><p>A bright pain spread throughout his body like several lightning discharges trying to reduce its power.</p><br><p>The height was clearly a bit beyond what Adam's body could withstand, but a properly performed somersault helped him escape injury.</p><br><p>"Shit... If I fell on my feet, I'd definitely break them or hurt my knees. Height is a dangerous thing..." Adam shook his head, walking out to the edge of the building the monster and Light Rain squad were under.</p><br><p>Romeo, Iren and the girl with the staff tried to do something to stop the monster or somehow cool it down, but the scarlet flames were undeterred.</p><br><p>"Their attacks are too weak. Although... I'm not sure even Alexia could put out that iron giant. She wouldn't need to, though. She'd just take it apart." Adam uttered, staring intently at the Firebreathing Trinadon.</p><br><p>'They're trying to weaken his flames, but... it's better to use his fire against himself.' Adam pondered as electrical discharges accumulated in his hand.</p><br><p>"Look! What's that?!" Romeo anxiously exclaimed, pointing to the lightning bolts clustered in the sky.</p><br><p>Irene's eyes went wide, then she quickly realized what was happening.</p><br><p>"Get back!" Iren ordered, moving as far away from the Firebreathing Trinadon as possible.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a mighty thunderbolt appeared behind her back, blue lightning consuming everything. Romeo saw everything through Iren, or rather through the tips of her blonde hair fluttering in the wind.</p><br><p>The first flame particles, like scarlet petals, came in contact with azure electric discharges, as fast as light traveling through worlds.</p><br><p>The next thing Romeo saw was a deafening explosion that grew louder and louder as each wisp of flame released its power, charged with electricity.</p><br><p>Naturally, it was Firebreathing Trinadon who suffered the most, even his sturdy armor couldn't withstand this explosive inferno.</p><br><p>Then, before the shockwave reached the Light Rain squad, Romeo saw the silver needle sweep through the series of explosions like an untouchable entity making its own way.</p><br><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..." Iren rose from the ground, coughing due to the dust and soot caught in her mouth.</p><br><p>She glanced around, and the first person she saw was Romeo - his leg was pressed under a massive stone slab.</p><br><p>"Romeo!" Iren alarmed, quickly freeing Romeo. It wasn't hard for her to lift such a weight.</p><br><p>"Shit... What was that...?" Romeo muttered, clutching his head.</p><br><br><p>Iren wanted to say something else, but...</p><br><p>"ROOOORRGGHHHK!!!!" The monster's mechanical roar distracted her, causing her to turn around sharply.</p><br><p>"What the fuck..." Iren muttered with her eyes wide open.</p><br><p>She carefully watched Phantom, who with a massive needle in his hands, was blocking all of Firebreathing Trinadon's attacks, even though the monster was using its four saws and two paws.</p><br><p>"Wait... Is that K2-Phantom? Who the hell is that? Why... why is he so calm?" Romeo asked bewilderedly, staring at Adam.</p><br><p>"No... It's not K2..." The girl with the staff gulped in a daze, "I know him..."</p><br><p>Iren's gaze turned serious, almost deadly - a sharp glint passed across her eyes.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter... That bastard... What's he doing here?" Iren muttered through gritted teeth. It seemed that the girl with the perfect reputation was quite aware of those who were at the bottom of this subjective ranking.</p><br><p>While the Light Rain squad stared intently at Adam, he too, saw something in front of him, and it wasn't Firebreathing Trinadon at all.</p><br><p>For some reason, his mind was comparing the monster's movements to the Steel Knight's attacks.</p><br><p>Adam literally saw the silhouette of a creature whose gene was in his Evolution Tree. Sure, it was a Power Gene and not an Initial One, but that made a great difference.</p><br><p>'You have four saws, two paws, and the ability to breathe fire - a total of seven attack sources, not considering you can use your legs, shoulders, and body push... However, you still look less dangerous than a creature with two sharp swords and an iron will to fight...' Adam inwardly muttered a slight sadness appearing in his gaze.</p><br><p>Then, electric shocks went through his legs as he, in a heartbeat, found himself close to the Firebreathing Trinadon. Adam immediately felt the heat coming from the monster, but he didn't need much time...</p><br><p>"Your flames won't have time to burn me or my threads..." Adam whispered as the glove on his left hand trembled, turning hundreds of threads into an eternal rotating sphere.</p><br><p>Then, Adam swung the needle from bottom to top, creating a gap in the monster's armor, only to plunge the silver sphere into it.</p>
