            <br><p>The Rule of Power - this is where it all started and would end at Adam's will.</p><br><p>Technically, The Rule of Power could be used by anyone against nobles, especially the higher nobles, because of their reputation's value and importance.</p><br><p>But... in practice, it wasn't that simple.</p><br><p>If the Twelve Branches families were to react to anyone who used The Rule of Power, then it would be an endless series of problems from hundreds or even thousands of people wanting to get even a tiny fraction of the wealth and power of the great families.</p><br><p>Therefore, to use The Rule of Power, one neededs a good and specific reason, clear motives, and a willingness to face the consequences.</p><br><p>For example: if two high nobles could not agree peacefully on some critical issue for their families, then, although very rarely, The Rule of Power was used.</p><br><p>To some extent, The Rule of Power was the last resort when there were no other options left and the issue could only be resolved by force.</p><br><p>Well, even so, if force was needed to determine the winner, it was much more common for nobles to resort to conventional combat, as The Rule of Power was something more significant, affecting not only the outcome of the conflict but also the reputation and perception of others.</p><br><p>However, even a good reason in most cases was not enough for The Rule of Power to take effect.</p><br><p>Those who dared to use The Rule of Power with some reason and justification for doing so also needed to have strong enough protectors - this happened to Adam when he was protected by Gladius, otherwise Mariel would have killed or injured him without giving him a chance to fight in battle.</p><br><p>In general, technically anyone could use it, but in practice, it happened very rarely between nobles and only when it was a last resort, if it was a commoner and a nobleman it required protectors as well, and something really serious had to happen.</p><br><p>But... it was all just a bunch of formalities, sometimes The Rule of Power was just a challenge to a fight that was simply impossible to refuse.</p><br><br><p>"What...? What did he just say?"</p><br><p>"Unbelievable, instead of finishing the fight he decided to do something no one expected..."</p><br><p>"Wait, is that possible? I mean... Technically, it's still past The Rule of Power. Damn, what's even going on here?!"</p><br><p>The crowd was baffled, as well as everyone in the arena. Now, all eyes were not on Adam and Fromund, but on Nirosh, with the occasional glance at Adam. Everyone was curious to see how Nirosh would respond.</p><br><p>After a while the shock was gone from Nirosh's face, changing to indignation.</p><br><p>"Hah?! Do you want to fight me? That's impossible! The previous The Rule of Power isn't over yet, and I'm one of the indirect participants! Fromund is fighting for me!"</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, Adam nodded.</p><br><p>"I see... So Nirosh Marzo is afraid of me."</p><br><p>Nirosh's eyebrow twitched, his face contorted in anger.</p><br><br><br><p>At the same moment, Kogen climbed down from his throne, stepping confidently onto the stone edge of his box. No one noticed it, but his aura appeared, and everyone turned to look at him, this time Kogen was in full control of his powers, and no one was in danger.</p><br><p>His gaze was serious, an excited smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Instead of pleasing my bloodlust, you decided to surprise me? Hah, that was your decision."</p><br><p>Adam quickly looked at Kogen but didn't say anything, his sword was still pointed at Nirosh, only a barrier separated them.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, Adam Vinter is right, it's so funny since Nirosh Marzo is actually terrified, isn't it?"</p><br><p>If it was anyone else, then Nirosh rudely replied, but... it was Kogen Noukx, the head of the great family, the gap in their statuses was too great.</p><br><p>"Look at this funny, even ridiculous scene!" Kogen exclaimed with a wide grin on his face.</p><br><p>The echo of his voice rang throughout the arena like a thunder strike, unwilling to listen to anyone but his orders.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter is injured, used all his abilities, and is literally on the verge of passing out, but Nirosh Marzo is afraid, even though they are both Natural Phantoms and are on the same level!"</p><br><p>Shame was the main emotion Nirosh felt as much as Zarot and his family members gathered at Moon Colosseum today.</p><br><p>"But... As much as I would like to, I can't force another nobleman to accept a challenge to fight. It's his decision."</p><br><p>Despite his words, Kogen only smirked evilly as he returned to his throne and planted one foot on the other.</p><br><p>It seemed that everything was already decided, and they just had to wait. However... only the most powerful and influential knew what Kogen was expecting, for others, it looked as if everything depended on Nirosh's decision.</p><br><br><p>Realizing that things could change for the worse at the very last moment, Osana stepped forward, anxiety in her gaze.</p><br><p>"Wait! Adam, what are you doing? Just finish the fight, and that's it!" Osana waved her hand.</p><br><p>She realized that The Rule of Power was still not complete, and if Nirosh agreed to fight and Adam lost, then the winner would be Fromund, that is Nirosh.</p><br><p>It was a complicated situation, but one thing was crucial to Osana - if this happened, she would become Nirosh's wife.</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam turned in her direction, looking at Osana with one eye hidden under his helmet.</p><br><p>"Shut up, Osana... I've already granted your wishes, now what happens in this fight is only my concern."</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Osana's body, cold sweat was ready to cover her forehead. A few moments were enough for her cunning mind to realize what Adam was talking about.</p><br><p>"But... Just finish the fight and then do what you want!"</p><br><p>However, her desperate cry did not affect Adam, he stopped looking at her, shifting his gaze back to Nirosh.</p><br><p>"And what does that change?"</p><br><p>"Agh...? What do you mean?"</p><br><p>"Did you forget? If I'm the winner then it's up to me to decide what to do with you, whether you become my wife or not will depend on my will alone. Those are your words."</p><br><p>Her face became darker, the goosebumps on her body showed that she understood all the risks.</p><br><p>Silvana, who was listening to their conversation attentively nodded deeply.</p><br><p>'Right, even if he finishes the fight now, Osana's opinion won't affect anything since he can just force her.'</p><br><p>Then, Silvana and Osana, simultaneously looked at Nirosh, a lot depended on him now.</p><br><p>He became the center of attention, not only for Adam, Osana, and Silvana but also for the entire arena and his family members.</p><br><p>"No..." Nirosh gulped.</p><br><p>"This is bullshit! I am not a fighter! I'm like Osana just a representative of a fighter!" Nirosh waved his hand with fear in his gaze.</p><br><br><p>'Unbelievable... his opponent can barely stand on his feet, and he's afraid.'</p><br><p>'How did he even become a Natural Phantom? He is a weakling inside and out!'</p><br><p>An irritated whisper spread throughout the spectator seats, such a reaction from Nirosh could not receive approval from the proud nobles.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, what Kogen had been waiting for happened.</p><br><p>The Moon Colosseum shuddered, and a multitude of blue flashes shot up through the barrier, flying into the sky to strike one specific target.</p>
