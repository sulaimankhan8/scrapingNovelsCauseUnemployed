            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1213: Amber Pond (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Fromund was one of those who only approached his peak form at the end of the battle, when the stakes were highest and every move was accompanied by risk.</p><br><p>That was why he wanted so badly to continue his fight against Marhen when he realized how capable his opponent really was.</p><br><p>However, like Marhen, Fromund had an ally. Their allies were fighting above and should not have been able to influence them in any way, but one move changed everything.</p><br><p>Under the shocked gaze of the monsters, the entire Kirani Colony split in two, from the lower level to the surface, where Adam and Bathild were fighting.</p><br><br><p>The first thing the monsters noticed was the drops of blood falling to the ground from such a height. They had to find out who was wounded.</p><br><p>Fromund and Marhen also looked up. For them, this was important information.</p><br><p>“Fuck…” Fromund muttered, looking at them.</p><br><p>Adam was taller, staring coldly at Bathild, who was holding her left shoulder with an expression of pain. A wide cut ran from her chest to her shoulder.</p><br><p>If a slightly weaker monster had been in her place, even if it had been Marhen, Adam’s cut would have killed it.</p><br><p>Bathild was close to that state. She barely dodged at the last moment so that the wound fell on her shoulder instead of her neck, which was Adam’s original target.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam made this cut through the Imaginary Cut, and he was full of strength, unlike Bathild, who still hadn’t found a way to surpass Adam in anything.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Bathild reached the surface, standing not far from their partners.</p><br><p>“Damn, looks like your fight went a lot further than mine, yeah?” Fromund asked.</p><br><p>Adam frowned. “Yes, and the sudden meteors falling from the sky greatly accelerated the process. Do you know what could be the reason?!”</p><br><p>Fromund smiled awkwardly, scratching the back of his head.</p><br><p>“Come on, everyone makes mistakes. Besides, Arayna said it wasn’t as bad for you as it was for her, right?”</p><br><p>This time, Adam responded more calmly.</p><br><p>“Yes, her storm quickly dissipated because of your meteors. However, she would have lost anyway. It’s inevitable, she’s too weak.”</p><br><p>If the situation had been different, Bathild would have pounced on the arrogant Phantom who dared to speak about her in such a dismissive tone.</p><br><p>But now she couldn’t do anything about it. She was fighting for her life. Adam was too strong for her to even risk approaching him.</p><br><p>She had to do something quickly to change their power dynamic, otherwise, after a few more clashes, he would simply wear her down, and his needle would pierce her heart.</p><br><p>Still, there was no despair in Bathild’s eyes, because she knew she had one trump card.</p><br><br><p>Marhen stepped forward.</p><br><p>He understood the situation, so in his opinion, there was only one right decision.</p><br><br><p>A bolt of lightning shot out from his wings, heading toward the ground.</p><br><p>Adam and Fromund thought it was a clever attack, but they quickly realized that the discharge was not moving toward them. It surrounded them in two lines, moving straight toward the amber pond in the distance.</p><br><p>The electrical discharges simply disappeared into the water, sending a signal.</p><br><p>The response was not long in coming.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A tremor ran across the surface of the lake as the trees around them quickly lost all their light. Whatever was hiding inside the pond was using every second that Bathild and Marhen had gained, as well as all the energy that was in the trees.</p><br><p>Then, a tall figure emerged from the pond, amber liquid dripping from its two broad wings, as if woven from glass.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, staring intently at the new participant in their battle who had been hiding from the beginning.</p><br><p>The tall woman stood knee-deep in the pond, bronze chitin with a golden sheen covering her strong, insect-like body. Her copper hair reached her shoulders, while four amber eyes stared intently at Fromund and Adam.</p><br><p>Unlike the thunder monsters, who looked at the woman with curiosity and even excitement, Bathild was not so impressed. On the contrary, she only frowned more deeply.</p><br><p>“Tsk.” Bathild spat out a clot of blood. “You asked me for help and decided to show yourself only now? What a nasty bitch you are!”</p><br><p>Marhen, on the other hand, was more reserved as he placed his palm on his chest and bowed slightly in greeting.</p><br><p>“It’s good to see you, Queen Moroya.”</p><br><p>The name was not the most common for humans, but for the monster bug queen, it was far from the strangest.</p><br><p>“Bathild.” Moroya’s deep voice echoed through the caves. “I knew who had come to my colony, which is why I decided to take advantage of our contract. To defeat these two Phantoms, to defeat Adam Vinter, we need all the strength we have. No exceptions.”</p><br><p>Adam and Fromund exchanged glances as they took a few steps to the side to face Moroya, Bathild, and Marhen at the same time.</p><br><p>However, none of them rushed to attack, for Moroya had not finished yet.</p><br><p>“I have used the time you gave me wisely. Now, I am almost certain that we will defeat our enemies.”</p><br><p>With these words, she slowly raised her hands as if to summon the guards.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The surface of the pond shook again as the liquid began to rapidly recede, gradually approaching one.</p><br><p>When almost nothing remained of the pond, two energy bursts shot upward, lifting two massive amber crystals above the ground.</p><br><p>Inside each crystal were two male monsters that looked very similar to each other.</p><br><p>Their chitin was as strong as Moroya’s, and each had four wings almost as wide as the Queen’s. They were almost identical except for two important details.</p><br><p>The left monster had silver-colored chitin, while the second had amber-colored chitin. Also, the left monster held a long sword in its hand, while the second was armed with a wide spear.</p><br><p>“I didn’t want to wake them so easily, but I’m afraid we won’t be able to handle them without the help of my Princes,” Moroya announced as she clenched her fists tightly.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, two crystals cracked as the princes’ eyes flashed a dangerous red light.</p><br><p>The silver prince and amber prince were ready to defend their home from the invaders.</p>
