            <br><p>Adam stared at the First Wall for a while before moving his eyes to his right fist.</p><br><p>"Dahla said to hit full force, as hard as I can. Well... I guess now I can use what I've learned here. After all, I've made some progress in two weeks." Explore stories on empire</p><br><p>The First Wall hovered quietly in the darkness, waiting for Adam to take action. After all, the First Wall had no purpose other than to be a barrier for Adam.</p><br><p>Adam closed his eyes as he moved to prepare.</p><br><p>Normally he would use several of his abilities to make a powerful attack, but now all he needed to do was one powerful strike.</p><br><p>Instinctively, Adam adopted a comfortable stance that pretty much mirrored the Plague Reaper's, when the Plague Reaper's fist should have made a hole in his body, but Osana saved him.</p><br><p>Through fights and defeats against Max, Adam got confidence, his body effortlessly repeating the right stance.</p><br><p>Even though he was technically floating in the void, there was a solid invisible surface beneath him. This was his inner space, it was adjusting to his needs.</p><br><p>"Alright, now let's use a new technique." Adam muttered as energy flowed in abundant streams throughout his body.</p><br><p>In fact, the Energy Control was not much different from what Adam used to do all the time before becoming a K2-Phantom.</p><br><p>But, whereas before he could only use energy to activate his abilities, now his control was enough to amplify various parts of his body.</p><br><p>Well, the Energy Control possessed by someone like Damien had many other purposes, but Adam hadn't even figured out the basics yet. The Energy Control over the energy in the body was what a K2-Phantom like Adam should work on.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The muscles on Adam's right fist tensed as he channeled almost 50% of all the energy in his body into his right hand.</p><br><p>If one could see Adam as if through an X-ray they would see the white streams in his body changed slightly. Everywhere else they became a little thinner and weaker, while the streams in his right arm became denser and thicker.</p><br><p>This was the most Adam could achieve now, moreover, he concentrated the gathered energy not in his hand but all over his arm.</p><br><p>"Hah, I still need to work on the area of effect and the maximum amount of energy, but it's not a bad result either. And... it's enough for my body for now." Adam muttered as he cast a glance at his right hand.</p><br><p>His fist trembled slightly, although the area was quite wide, an entire arm, but the energy was still too much for one spot.</p><br><p>Then, Adam took a deep breath, clenched his fist tightly, and brought his hand in for a punch.</p><br><p>Even though he wasn't fighting anyone right now, it was the strongest punch he had ever made. Such an attack would be able to blow a hole in the Plague Reaper's body as easily as he did to Osana.</p><br><br><p>Adam's torso bent forward as he drove his fist with all his might straight into the center of the First Wall.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Tremble energies spread around, traveling all over the First Wall that was trying to absorb the damage from Adam's punch.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Crackle.</p><br><p>At the same moment, cracks began to spread from Adam's fist, running along the First Wall like glass about to break into hundreds of shards from the crushing force.</p><br><p>But... if it was as easy as this, then everyone would easily pass the first part of the First Wall in one try.</p><br><p>When the power of the momentum reached its limit, the cracks stopped growing.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The First Wall shuddered as the cracks shone brightly, the light was bright and blinding, bringing with it a threat, but not to Adam...</p><br><br><p>"What's going on...?" Silvana muttered with a slight fear in her voice. Goosebumps went down her body, she could feel that something was happening to Adam.</p><br><p>Riska placed a hand on her shoulder caringly.</p><br><p>"Don't worry, if something unforeseen happens, Dahla will protect us. Though, it's unlikely Adam's first strike will be that powerful."</p><br><p>Saying the last words, Riska narrowed her eyes staring at Adam intently.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, a dense energy with a pure white light emerged from Adam's body as if it came from the Midnight Crystal.</p><br><p>The energy quickly turned into clots of different shapes, more like projectiles, that shot straight towards the walls.</p><br><p>Several of the blade-shaped blobs moved towards Silvana and Riska, who weren't prepared for such a scenario.</p><br><p>Dahla's eyes went wide as she abruptly stepped away from the wall and stood in the middle of the passage.</p><br><p>'What the hell? Even though I told him to attack at full power, isn't this too strong for a first attempt?' Dahla internally exclaimed before summoning a golden barrier.</p><br><p>The walls were made of strong materials and covered with something special so they were strong enough to withstand this attack.</p><br><p>The energy blobs simply crashed into the walls splitting into tiny particles before disappearing completely.</p><br><p>Dahla's barrier did the job easily, thus protecting Silvana and Riska. Their eyes were wide open, watching the situation unfold.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The last blobs of energy collided with the golden barrier, losing without a chance to the defense of the stronger Phantom, but Dahla was amazed that there was so much energy.</p><br><p>That meant only one thing - that Adam's first strike was far more powerful than they all expected.</p><br><p>Dahla swung her arm, removing her barrier and stepping forward confidently. She was still standing in front of Silvana and Riska, just in case this wasn't the end. She couldn't let the two Operators get hurt.</p><br><p>Looking at Dahla, Riska smiled as her cheeks flushed slightly.</p><br><p>'Agh... Every time I find myself in a situation like this I realize that I made the right choice in refusing to be a Phantom. Many people consider it a weakness, but it's an incredible feeling to be protected by someone strong...' Riska muttered to herself.</p><br><p>Riska realized that Dahla was very strong and that as a Phantom she had a duty to protect the Operators, but this feeling of being defenseless and giving up control to someone else was intoxicating to her.</p><br><p>Silvana, unlike Riska, was not looking at Dahla but at Adam. She wanted to know what happened inside his inner space and how much damage he could do to the First Wall.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Adam, unaware of what had happened in the real world, watched as particles of light came out of the cracks.</p><br><p>They were not in a hurry to disappear as clots, on the contrary, they were heading towards one point - to the top of the First Wall.</p><br><br><p>The light particles accelerated sharply, turning into a multitude of snow-white streams.</p><br><p>Under Adam's astonished gaze, the streams quickly took a shape that would be understandable to Adam.</p><br><p>"What...? Is that the best I can do?"</p><br><p>Adam muttered as his eyes traveled upward.</p><br><p>He was looking at a number that would be a true accomplishment to others, but Adam decided it was a failure.</p><br><br><p>That was how much of the First Wall was covered in cracks after his strike, which was equal to how much of the First Wall he could destroy.</p>
