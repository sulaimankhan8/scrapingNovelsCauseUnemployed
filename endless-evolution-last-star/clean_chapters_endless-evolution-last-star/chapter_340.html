            <br><br><p>Adam leaped forward, quickly finding himself in front of Plague Reaper, who was ready to face him as an equal opponent.</p><br><p>Without waiting for his enemy to react, Adam gripped the needle tightly, thrusting it forward, intending to pierce Plague Reaper's chest.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's eyes narrowed, and he abruptly took a step to the side missing Adam's needle right in front of him. The silver needle whizzed close to his chest, but all Adam managed to accomplish was tearing a piece of cloth off Plague Reaper's coat.</p><br><p>'Shit... I've done this sort of thing a few times when fighting other monsters, but... this was the first time I've been outmaneuvered so easily.' Adam gulped, before changing the grip of his needle, and bringing his needle down on Plague Reaper, pointing his needle to the right.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper let out a light, casual sigh before abruptly bending backwards, letting Adam's needle pass over his nose.</p><br><p>For a moment, the silver needle reflected in Plague Reaper's calm eyes before it was replaced by electric shocks followed by a bare, tightly clenched fist.</p><br><p>It seemed that Plague Reaper had to dodge now in some strange way. His physical capabilities were probably enough for that, but... instead, a slight smile appeared on his face.</p><br><br><p>Adam's fist slammed into Plague Reaper's face with all its might, plunging his head into the ground, breaking the cold hard floor with ease.</p><br><p>Stone shards flew upward, flying apart and falling next to the cracks that spread like spider webs from the point of impact.</p><br><p>"Adam! Look out!" Erla exclaimed with a slight worry in her voice. Right now, Adam was their main hope for victory, but Erla couldn't just stand by and watch him fight alone. She had to take action.</p><br><p>Then, Adam jerked his head to the side, only to see dozens of white projectiles. They were approaching Plague Reaper like a hail of arrows, about to rain down on him from above.</p><br><p>'Hah, looks like we're getting our first successes.' Adam inwardly grinned with an excited expression watching Erla's attack.</p><br><p>He had seen a similar attack once before when he went on a mission with Zera's Squad, but given the circumstances, Erla's attack looked much more spectacular and devastating.</p><br><br><p>Adam tore to the side, moving out of the danger zone.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper was still lying on the ground, his head buried in the ground and a trickle of blood running slowly down his pale skin from his nose.</p><br><p>The snow-white projectiles reflected in his eyes like stars in the night sky, gradually growing larger and larger, making Plague Reaper smile once more.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper slammed his fist against the ground, but not out of anger, his hand moved at a right angle, to a certain point.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A shudder ran through the ground as a stone platform rose up from Plague Reaper's left, literally knocked out of the ground by the impact of his fist.</p><br><br><p>The first shells hit that very platform, shattering it into shards, releasing white flames of explosion outward.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper whipped his coat before leaping forward as a black flash whizzed through the white fire.</p><br><p>"What the hell?!" Erla exclaimed in disbelief, watching as Plague Reaper quickly ran away from her projectiles.</p><br><p>However, a smirk soon appeared on Erla's face as the projectiles from her Second Order were no ordinary projectiles. Aside from being part of one more powerful projectile, they could pursue their original target.</p><br><p>Sure, Plague Reaper was able to get rid of a few of the projectiles by making them crash into the stone platform, but that was only a small fraction of Erla's attack.</p><br><br><p>Before the projectiles reached the ground, they abruptly changed their trajectory, heading after Plague Reaper.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper turned his head back, looking over his shoulder at his undead pursuers. His eyes went wide for a moment, but that was all the reaction Erla deserved from him.</p><br><p>"No way... He's too fast. Erla's projectiles can't catch up with him!" Lero exclaimed, worried about the success of Erla's attack.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's legs were practically undetectable to Lero's gaze. They looked like two shadows that only swayed slightly while they were actually moving at a tremendous speed, allowing Plague Reaper to pass the entire Fume Cathedral in a few seconds.</p><br><p>His silhouette whizzed past the columns that the projectiles occasionally crashed into, unable to change their trajectory as quickly and deftly as Plague Reaper did.</p><br><p>"Hah, you don't have to worry about that. He's really fast, but I wouldn't say it's a problem for us." Katrin smirked confidently before slamming her staff on the ground.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>At the same moment, roots began to emerge from the ground and walls, many more of them than last time, covering everything around like deadly spiky vines.</p><br><p>'Grh, it took a lot of energy, but if I can stop this bastard for even a second, it'll be worth it.' Katrin muttered internally as her gaze grew fainter and bags appeared under her eyes as if she hadn't slept in a long time.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper leaped forward, trying to dodge the roots. The tips of the first roots had failed to catch his legs, but the second time he wasn't so lucky.</p><br><br><p>Several roots curled tightly around Plague Reaper, holding him in one place, or at least they tried to.</p><br><br><p>Being completely obliged by the multitude of roots, Plague Reaper continued to step forward, causing them to tear like ropes unable to withstand such pressure.</p><br><p>Katrin gulped. She couldn't imagine how strong Plague Reaper's legs were if even so many roots were nothing more than weak threads against him, unable to hold the wild beast.</p><br><p>But... Erla's projectiles were too close.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper roared furiously like a true monster, tearing Katrin's roots apart with his hands. The thorns stabbed into his hands, making blood gush, but it was a low price to pay for what he managed to achieve.</p><br><p>In the next moment, Plague Reaper turned into dark smoke, disappearing and ending up far behind Erla.</p><br><p>The next thing Erla saw was her own projectiles coming towards her. And... if she saved Oskar from his sword, can anyone save Erla from its destructive power?"</p>
