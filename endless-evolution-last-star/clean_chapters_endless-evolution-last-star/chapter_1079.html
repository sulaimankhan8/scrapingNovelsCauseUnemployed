            <br><p>Chapter 1079: Shadow Hail (Part 1)<br>
The twenty young wing monsters didn’t stand out for anything, they all had one goal: to capture Adam and force him to lead them to the Twilight Crystal.</p><br><p>At least that’s what he thought until he ran into Lexa.</p><br><p>Something about her had struck him as odd from the start.</p><br><p>Any other monster would have joined the trio to help them deal with Adam. At the very least, stand by watching the events unfold.</p><br><p>But Lexa had only a moment to make a decision and kill one of her kind. There was no cruelty or any savagery in her movements, no… she got rid of the obstacle in her way, nothing more.</p><br><p>Now, when Adam asked his question, Lexa’s calm expression was gone, replaced by a frantic flame in her eyes.</p><br><p>“You only have one wish?” Adam asked, wary.</p><br><p>Just because Lexa killed one of his enemies didn’t make her his ally. It only showed how unstable a person she was.</p><br><br><p>Lexa flapped her wings as she appeared in front of Adam. His hand trembled, but he didn’t attack.</p><br><p>“I don’t need the Twilight Crystal. The First Star…” Lexa gasped. “It summoned you, so the Twilight Crystal is rightfully yours. It’s your mission, but…!”</p><br><p>Suddenly, Lexa touched Adam’s shoulders, nailing him to the wall. His grip around the needle only grew stronger.</p><br><p>“Please!” Lexa exclaimed. “Let me see the Twilight Crystal! Let me witness what part of the First Star looks like!”</p><br><br><p>This was not a request he was expecting from one of the contestants.</p><br><p>“Is that all you want?”</p><br><p>Lexa’s eyes sparkled. “YES. Just get me in there! I’ll be your partner! I’ll help you! Just don’t turn me down!”</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam got the answer to who Lexa was.</p><br><p>Unlike all the other monsters at the Soaring Chain Islands, deep inside, she had long ago made a decision on which faction she would follow. It was obvious.</p><br><p>‘Damn, she’s like Kenward, the monster of the Free End, but much younger and crazier. If he’s like a guardian who protects the will of the First Star, then she’s just a fucking fanatic who’s just about to take that route.’</p><br><p>Who was Adam to turn her down?</p><br><p>“Hah, fine, but if you try to attack me, I’ll do anything to kill you. So you won’t see the Twilight Crystal.”</p><br><p>Joy and genuine fright were reflected in Lexa’s eyes.</p><br><p>“S-Sure! Don’t worry! I won’t become your enemy! I just want to see the Twilight Crystal… I don’t need anything else!”</p><br><p>‘Adam, although the situation has changed, this girl is not just still dangerous, she’s become much more dangerous than she was a moment ago.’</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes, scrutinizing Lexa’s gaze.</p><br><p>‘Back then, we didn’t know she was insane.’</p><br><p>Adam shrugged, heading forward towards the mushroom he had to move away from.</p><br><p>“Come on, let’s not waste any time. By the way.” Adam turned around over his shoulder. “What’s your name?”</p><br><p>“Lexa! And…” her eyes dipped lower, by Adam’s stride, she understood. “If you need to go down to the river, I can help.”</p><br><p>Adam ran his gaze over her wide wings as a smirk formed on his face.</p><br><p>“Well, that’s a good idea. Yeah, the dark route leads me down. Somewhere on the far side of this gorge is the Twilight Crystal, that’s what the Twilight Crystal is showing me.”</p><br><br><p>Lexa flapped her wings, lifting Adam above the ground.</p><br><p>“Guide me. I will be your wings.” Lexa’s serious voice boomed out.</p><br><p>“Here.” Adam pointed downward. “Put me down by the river, then we’ll see where to go next.”</p><br><br><p>A few minutes after the incident, the rest of the wing monsters figured out where Adam was most likely headed. This was possible since they explored almost all the caves. Also, the corpse in one of the caves was a sign of the right path.</p><br><p>Soon, more and more monsters were in the underground gorge. The three corpses at the bottom shocked them.</p><br><p>It showed how powerful the Phantom they were after was.</p><br><p>They didn’t know that one of the trio was killed by Lexa, a member of the trial like them. Adam and Lexa disappeared into the depths of the underground gorge, approaching the Twilight Crystal while time was running out for the others.</p><br><p>“Damn it! What was Mr. Saegar letting Phantom have a chance to get what should belong to us, the monsters!” the young man exclaimed, clenching his fists tightly with anger.</p><br><p>The girl soared up beside him, running her gaze all over the gorge.</p><br><p>“I don’t think challenging our Lord’s actions is the smartest decision. It’s been long enough, we must hurry if we don’t want to embarrass ourselves and our Lord!”</p><br><p>The other young monsters looked over at each other. Fighting spirit was evident in their eyes, they made a common decision that it was necessary to keep moving.</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A violent shudder of unprecedented power reached this deep. Stalactites collapsed down with chunks of walls breaking off, several monsters had to duck to keep the debris from nailing them to the ground.</p><br><p>“What the hell was that?!” Someone exclaimed in panic.</p><br><p>The girl looked up, a great frown covering her face.</p><br><p>“Shit. Looks like the Twilight Crystal and the Phantom hunt isn’t the real purpose of this trial.”</p><br><p>“But, does that mean we have to go back up there?”</p><br><p>Many people were confused. They all had only limited information.</p><br><p>“I don’t think so. We are most likely in a safe place right now. Where the threat is at the top… Fuck…”</p><br><p>Adam and Lexa, who were in the depths of the underground gorge, also felt a shiver.</p><br><p>‘Bad, we need to speed up.’ Adam narrowed his eyes, watching the dense particles of darkness in front of him.</p><br><p>The dark route had almost turned into a single trail resembling a string.</p><br><p>“Lexa, I think we’re almost there.”</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward confidently, plunging into the dark part of the caves where there was barely any light from the sparse blue mushrooms.</p><br><p>“I think a few more turns and we’ll see the Twilight Crystal.”</p><br><p>Then, he sighed heavily.</p><br><p>“The important thing is to survive until then.”</p>
