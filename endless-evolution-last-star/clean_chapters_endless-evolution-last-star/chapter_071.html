            <br><p>In a hurry, Adam finally reached the Black Shell. It was a tall, dark building on a street corner, lit by pleasant square lights that seemed to levitate in the air.</p><br><p>"Adam! You've finally arrived!" Zera exclaimed happily when she saw him, "Damn, I thought you weren't coming anymore. Honestly, I was worried."</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh.... I'm sorry, something just happened on the way over. I wasn't counting on it and completely forgot about the time." Adam replied, coming to his senses.</p><br><p>Zera gave him a questioning look.</p><br><p>"Some idiot from Proud Wing crashed into me and made a real show of blaming me for everything! Well, it's a good thing the cops handled it all quickly, and I didn't have to waste any more time." Adam explained.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Zera's look completely changed as if she had seen something repulsive and hateful.</p><br><p>"Proud Wing... Shit, I hope those stupid bastards all die one day. They just don't know what they're doing! Phantoms are the past, present, and future! We need to evolve as quickly and efficiently as possible to protect the Citadel, and they want to limit us! Tsk.</p><br><p>It's a good thing only fanatics and idiots support them." Zera snorted with a great grimace.</p><br><p>Adam didn't comment on that in any way, he just nodded slightly. He thought that for Zera, who was a member of the Crimson Path, this was a normal, expected reaction.</p><br><p>"Agh, alright, I don't want to think about it. We should be resting today! Let's go, the others have already started without us! We have to hurry, or else they'll eat everything!" Zera vigorously said, took Adam's hand, and went inside.</p><br><p>Scarlet River Squad took up the entire left side of the bar, several tables were filled with various food and alcohol, all for a lively evening.</p><br><p>Adam sat at the same counter as Zera, Dargo, and Hazel. Adam didn't often drink alcohol, so tonight was a new experience for him since he had never tasted so many kinds of beer before, along with some interesting appetizers.</p><br><p>Phrase by phrase, everyone found some topic to discuss, and Adam was no exception. Mostly, they talked about their past missions, the accomplishments of other Phantoms, and their plans for the future.</p><br><p>Phantoms, like ordinary people, needed to rest because emotional well-being was more important than physical health in most cases. It was impossible to fight well when depressed.</p><br><p>"Alright! It's about time we went to the shooting range!" Hazel exclaimed as she abruptly stood up with her eyes burning with anticipation.</p><br><p>"A shooting range?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><br><p>"Sure! It's the best thing ever!"</p><br><p>"Adam, have you ever shot a gun before?" Zera asked, looking at him with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>Adam shook his head. He had never held a gun in his hands, he wasn't military, so he did not need for it, especially after becoming a Phantom.</p><br><p>"In that case, I think you'll like it. Come on. What's more, whoever can earn the most points will get a prize from Black Shell!" Zera offered as she held out her hand.</p><br><p>Adam hardly had a choice, so he only smiled back, though he didn't mind. In fact, he was even slightly curious.</p><br><br><br><p>The massive shooting range was directly below the Black Shell, a few floors below. It was a spacious room, fully soundproofed to avoid disturbing the others and concentrate on the task.</p><br><p>Not all members of the Scarlet Rivel Squad chose to participate, so three lanes with a few people in each lane was enough for them.</p><br><p>"Alright! Rules as usual." Dargo said, clapping his hands, "Everyone takes seven shots three times, totaling twenty-one shots. Whoever scores the most points wins! Hitting the outer ring is one point, hitting the inner ring is three points, hitting the center is seven points!"</p><br><p>"Hell yeah! Let's get started already!" Hazel exclaimed happily, getting first.</p><br><p>At the same time, Dargo and Zera were also firing.</p><br><br><p>The first round began as they quickly executed their seven shots since they only had ten seconds to do so. They fired the same revolvers.</p><br><p>"Yes! As always I'm the best!" Hazel jumped up, clenching her fist.</p><br><p>In seven shots she was able to get 32 points, Dargo 25, and Zera 19. They went back to the end of the line, and the next ones started shooting.</p><br><p>Soon, Adam had the revolver in his hands. He was a little surprised at how heavy it was, then nodded and aimed.</p><br><br><p>Adam, as a complete beginner, only hit a few times and totaled 11 points. It wasn't bad for the first time, but Adam wasn't satisfied, at all.</p><br><p>'Damn! That's practically the lowest of the lot! There's no way I'm winning this way!' Adam inwardly exclaimed, staring intently at the target.</p><br><p>He did this until it was his turn again, his only desire was to hit the center as many times as possible.</p><br><p>When he picked up the revolver again, for some reason his Evolution Tree trembled, and his Power Gene - Steel Knight, shone brightly.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam felt strange, as if the world had slowed down, the revolver became lighter, and the target seemed to be much closer.</p><br><p>He gripped the revolver more comfortably and fired seven quick shots.</p><br><p>"Wow, beginner's luck, right?" Zera smirked, looking at Adam's second result - 35 points out of a possible 49, a total he already had 46.</p><br><p>"Not bad, maybe if you get lucky again you might even be able to outrun Hazel!" Dargo chuckled, "Normally, we don't stand a chance against her, but she's had so much booze that there's still hope!"</p><br><p>"Hey! I'm not an alcoholic! I just wanted to rest!" Hazel exclaimed displeased.</p><br><br><p>"Well, I'll try, I have one more try!" Adam replied with a slight smile on his face and walked back.</p><br><p>Then, a shiver ran through his body as he felt the effects of his Power Gene. He was holding the revolver for the first time but was already learning faster than the others. It was real!</p>
