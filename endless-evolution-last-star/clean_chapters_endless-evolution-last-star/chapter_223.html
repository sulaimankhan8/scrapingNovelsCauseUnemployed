            <br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The creature with the strongest defense among the Purple Threat Level was making every possible effort to hold its defense in front of K2-Phantom, who was diligently trying to reveal it.</p><br><p>"Come on! I can't waste any more time on you! I've been doing this forever!" Prago uttered, gritting his teeth while trying to pull apart the edges of the Obsidian Armadillo's protective form.</p><br><p>Prago was doing his best to open the Obsidian Armadillo, his muscles were tense, and his hands were shaking, like a man who couldn't open a tightly twisted jar even though it seemed like an easy task.</p><br><p>'A little more! I can already see a gap!" Adelia exclaimed encouragingly. She realized that if Prago succeeded, it would be all over for Obsidian Armadillo.</p><br><p>However, Obsidian Armadillo also understood that. That was why it curled up into a protective form so that it wouldn't have to fight against Prago directly.</p><br><br><p>A long tail covered in sharp dark crystals wrapped around Prago's arm, stabbing deeply and causing trickles of blood to rush out.</p><br><p>However, this did not frighten Prago at all, on the contrary, it brought a wide grin to his face, for if Obsidian Armadillo went to such desperate measures, then he was at his limit!</p><br><p>"Alright, all I have to do is push a little harder!" Prago exclaimed before abruptly thrusting his arms in different directions.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a loud crackling sound was heard from the breaking crystals that were overlapping each other due to Obsidian Armadillo's body bending at an unnatural angle.</p><br><p>"RRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!"</p><br><p>Obsidian Armadillo let out an annoyed wheeze as he tried to stop Prago with his fog and tail, but it was already too late.</p><br><p>Prago's pupils narrowed as a spiked tongue emerged from Obsidian Armadillo's mouth with the speed of a harpoon.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Prago jerked his head sharply to the side, missing the tongue on the left side of his neck, and several spikes left bleeding scratches.</p><br><p>Then, Prago stepped forward sharply, placing his foot on the lower edge of the Obsidian Armadillo's shell. In doing so, Prago freed one of his arms.</p><br><br><p>Before the Obsidian Armadillo could get its tongue back after the failed attack, Prago grabbed it tightly, not allowing the Obsidian Armadillo to budge.</p><br><p>"Oh, looks like I finally managed to catch you, didn't I?" Prago uttered in a calm voice before jerking his hand sharply, effortlessly ripping out the long tongue of the Obsidian Armadillo.</p><br><p>Streams of blood rushed from the monster's mouth, flying in front of Prago's cold eyes as his lips came into motion:</p><br><br><p>Cutting through the wind currents, Prago's palm, like a spear, headed for the monster's chest, piercing through the protective plates and severing Obsidian Armadillo's insides into a bloody mess.</p><br><p>Obsidian Armadillo's eyes shifted downward, looking at Prago's arm covered in dark blood that soon headed upward, splitting the monster in half.</p><br><br><p>On the other side of the battlefield, a flaming whirlwind rose up from Tirana's wings that flapped rapidly, driving away the Ladies rushing to help their leader.</p><br><p>"Bitch! I warned you!" Tirana said menacingly, thrusting her sword into Jade Lady's scarred back.</p><br><p>Jade Lady had no mouth, so she couldn't scream from the horrible pain, but it was obvious from her quivering four pupils how much agony she was in at that moment.</p><br><p>Completely uncontained in her cruelty and bloodlust, Tirana smoothly cut off Jade Lady's wings with her sword, while her own wings created a vortex protecting her from the Ladies.</p><br><p>There was nothing Jade Lady could do, for as soon as Tirana fell to the ground with her first powerful attack, she completely seized the initiative and began to dominate their battle.</p><br><br><p>A torrent of blood rushed out as Tirana ripped the first snow-white wing from Jade Lady's back, revealing an unprotected area on her body.</p><br><p>There was no solid layer of jade here, meaning Tirana could easily thrust her sword deep into the flesh, burning Jade Lady alive.</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that Tirana had a limited amount of time, otherwise the Ladies would have made it through the flame vortex. She had time to do her thing, though.</p><br><br><p>The vortex dissipated, as well as Tirana's wings.</p><br><p>She looked around tiredly, watching the Ladies falling to the ground with empty eyes. Their leader, Conqueror Jade Lady, was defeated and literally burned.</p><br><p>Tirana smiled contentedly. Her plan worked perfectly, and her fire was proving to be the right tool for the battle against Jade Lady.</p><br><p>"Fine... I still have a trump card left, even though I'm pretty tired, but with this, I should be able to kill Adam Vinter..." Tirana muttered with a bitter smile, clutching her amulet tightly.</p><br><p>"By the way..." Tirana blinked a few times, "He's supposed to be fighting against Thunder Demon, I wonder what's going on there. I'm sure he'll show his full potential in this fight if he's going to survive..."</p><br><p>Then, Tirana looked in the direction where Thunder Demon had last been, and a shiver ran through her body.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon, holding Adam firmly by the head, ran forward quickly, raising waves of salt.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Thunder Demon definitely had a target - one of the three main anomalies. It seemed that even Thunder Demon was hesitant to be in the epicenter of such a powerful anomaly, and that was exactly why he was going to throw Adam!</p><br><br><p>Adam was hitting Thunder Demon's paw, with his needle and fist as hard as he could, leaving some pretty deep wounds on the monster's body, but it wasn't enough to slow Thunder Demon down even a little bit!</p><br><p>'Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! He's going to kill me with an anomaly!' Adam inwardly exclaimed, starting to panic slightly.</p><br><p>He realized that even with Elemental Root, he had no chance of withstanding such powerful lightning bolts, they would just tear him apart and turn him into dust!</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Adam's Evolution Tree trembled as his gaze traveled to his hands, more specifically his gloves.</p><br><p>Adam only had a few seconds to make a difficult decision, because if he used his Nexus now, he wouldn't be able to do it again!</p><br><p>'Fine... Even if I do... I lose one trump card just like you!' Adam exclaimed internally, threw the needle away, and put his palms together as his eyes shone brightly, allowing the gloves to form a rapidly spinning sphere of hundreds of silver, sharp threads.</p>
