            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1482: Purchasing a Home and the Way Forward</strong></p><br><p>The following evening, after viewing apartments for the first time, a woman emerged from one of the skyscrapers with a satisfied smile. It was a real estate agent who had been assisting Adam and Silvana with their selection yesterday and today.</p><br><p>The skyscraper she had just left was located to the left of the other skyscrapers, but not at the very edge, and looked like a majestic monolith reaching for the heavens.</p><br><p>It was the Obsidian Tower, one of many skyscrapers in the very center of the First Ring.</p><br><p>A few minutes ago, the penthouse at the top of this skyscraper had a new owner, namely Adam Vinter.</p><br><p>All documents, keys, ID cards, and so on were now in his possession. Sure, it would take a few more days to complete some legal formalities, but the main documents had already been drawn up, and all parties had accepted each other’s terms.</p><br><p>“Yay!” Silvana happily twirled around, while Adam held the main document of ownership with trembling hands.</p><br><p>His eyebrows twitched when his gaze fell on the price of this penthouse — 45,000,000 credits.</p><br><p>“Shit, 45 million. Silvana, where am I even going to get that kind of money?” Adam asked. “Will I have anything left after this purchase?”</p><br><p>“Hah, you’re worried about that now? Weren’t you the one who gave this penthouse a 95 out of 100? It was your choice!”</p><br><br><p>“Pffft, didn’t you like this one better than all the others, too? It was a joint decision and nothing else.”</p><br><br><p>“Sure, this house isn’t as big as the others, although… its size is still impressive. It’s almost like a castle on top of a tower! Everything else is just top-notch: the best materials, design, electronics, security system, appliances, and so on.”</p><br><p>She paused to glance at the document in Adam’s trembling hands.</p><br><p>“Still, even all that doesn’t fully justify the $45 million price tag. That’s insane money.”</p><br><p>“Well…” Silvana flopped down on the sofa. “Considering how many monsters you killed in the Dead Lands, you earned a lot of money. Moreover, don’t forget the several duels you participated in. As a fighter, you always received a small percentage of the bets. I mean, when you fought against Reinz and the Alderran Family territory, just one Erik bet 700 million on your victory.”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened in realization. He remembered that day well, and the battle at the end of it was when his family got their current home.</p><br><p>“Hah, and I complain that this luxury penthouse costs 45 million? Where did he get so much money?”</p><br><p>Silvana waved her hand dismissively.</p><br><p>“He’s the strongest person in his family, the Wurhen Family. Don’t forget that they’re one of the Twelve Branches. Also, he’s a Second Rank Phantom and has probably lived through several World Wipes. If you don’t have a few billion in your account after all that time and under those conditions, then you’re clearly doing something wrong.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded as he sat down next to Silvana. He put the document aside and looked at their new home.</p><br><p>Everything was beautiful and stylish, but it was obvious that it would take them a long time before this luxury penthouse turned into a cozy home.</p><br><p>“We have a lot of work ahead of us, right?” Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>Silvana rolled her eyes and hugged him from the side.</p><br><p>“Of course. I don’t want our home to look like a typical property for sale. The next time you return from the Dead Lands, there will be a robot vacuum cleaner moving across the floor, a bunch of useless appliances in the kitchen that I’ll use once a year, and an army of stuffed animals on the couches.”</p><br><p>“Hah, sounds good, I’d even say great. By the way, since we now own such a cool house, would you mind if I invited my family over? I know you keep in touch with them, but it’s not the same as having dinner together.”</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Silvana’s gaze became more serious.</p><br><p>“Oh, that’s a good idea. I don’t mind, I even support it, but… don’t you dare do it without warning! I have to think of what to serve. I mean, I have to impress them!”</p><br><p>Adam shrugged. He knew it wasn’t necessary. Whether Silvana cooked something or not, would not affect how their evening went.</p><br><p>But he didn’t try to talk her out of it either. She was a good cook, and he was always hungry.</p><br><p>Who would turn that down?</p><br><p>They were silent for a while, thinking about everything that had happened to them over the past few days and months. They had both changed a lot, not only as a Phantom and Operator, but as two youths trying to figure out how to navigate this chaotic world.</p><br><p>Of course, they had grown closer to each other. There was no doubt about that. Sooner or later, most Phantoms and Operators came to the same conclusion.</p><br><p>“We’ve done all the important things, haven’t we?” Silvana murmured, pressing herself against his chest.</p><br><br><p>“We have no reason to rush. I mean, we don’t have much time, but overall, a few days or even weeks won’t change anything if it doesn’t prevent us from becoming stronger.”</p><br><p>Silvana smiled bitterly. “Still, there’s a lot of work ahead. Soon you’ll be back at the Dead Lands, but before that, you have something to do, don’t you?”</p><br><p>“Yeah, I wanted to do it a long time ago, right after the battle against Menax, but… Huh, that bastard impressed me. Especially his last request.</p><br><p>I don’t know if I would have the courage to ask the person who killed me to burn my body…”</p><br><p>“Hah, knowing you? You wouldn’t want weaker fighters to gain any advantage from your defeat. Watching you, I realized that it’s better to lose to a worthy opponent than to defeat a weakling.”</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head.</p><br><p>“Well, I don’t know how true that is, but I think that’s pretty much how it is. Back then, many hunters came after me, but only Menax was able to give me a worthy fight.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Silvana bit her lip.</p><br><p>“It’s time to move on and find out, right?”</p><br><p>Adam nodded confidently as his gaze deepened.</p><br><p>“Yes. I must see the next conditions, the conditions for the Third Grand Star.”</p>
