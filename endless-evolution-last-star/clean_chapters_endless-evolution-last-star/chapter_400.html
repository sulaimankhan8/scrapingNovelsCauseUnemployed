            <br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The chamber shook, from the destruction brought by Damien. Douglas and Dahla's eyes went wide with momentary surprise.</p><br><p>Sure, unlike Adam and Silvana, they had seen Damien fight many times, but he didn't often participate in such experiments, lowering his power level to spar with someone.</p><br><p>For a K2-Level, inflicting such devastation with energy and physical strength alone seemed impossible. Moreover, Damien had set his power level at the lower limit of the K2, so it appeared even more intimidating.</p><br><br><p>Damien was confidently approaching Adam.</p><br><p>"Hey, don't tell me you're scared. Just like you wanted me to, I started using the energy, but that has its consequences."</p><br><br><p>Without waiting for Adam's response, Damien swung the black rod, bringing its tip down to the ground. The stone slab cracked, rapidly crumbling under the great power.</p><br><p>"What are you going to do? Try to run away or take the fight?" Damien asked threateningly, slowly approaching Adam.</p><br><p>Adam didn't answer anything. He was trying to figure out what to do, he had to somehow block Damien's attacks or dodge them.</p><br><p>Damien nodded, realizing that he wouldn't wait for an answer.</p><br><p>"Well, in that case, let's see what you can do!" Damien exclaimed vigorously charging at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes narrowed as he arched sharply, dodging Damien's attack.</p><br><p>A black rod whizzed over his head, crashing into the wall a moment later. Dust covered everything in front of them, but Damien wasn't about to stop.</p><br><p>With each attack, he was getting faster and more confident, the situation for Adam was the opposite. It was harder for him to dodge, so... soon he had to take a risk, a forced one.</p><br><p>'Tsk... If it hits me straight on, it won't just break my arm, it'll rip it off my body. But... I think I can block his attack if I do it right.' Adam pondered for a moment before stopping.</p><br><p>He took a step back, trying to give his stance the most resistance, then his needle came into motion appearing in front of him for the sole purpose of protecting him from the coming threat.</p><br><p>A slight smile appeared on Damien's face as he made a sharp turn, diagonally attacking. The black rod slammed into Adam's needle, into its flat part.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The impact threw Adam aside, throwing him into the wall.</p><br><p>But, this time, it was a lot harsher than usual.</p><br><p>Splashes of blood gushed from Adam's mouth, while trickles of blood flowed from behind his back, his flesh ripped and his ribs cracked from the impact.</p><br><p>"What... How did that happen..." Silvana muttered in disbelief, "Even if it's Damien... Was the momentum from the collision with the wall so powerful to cause such wounds?"</p><br><br><p>Douglas sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"No, you misunderstood what just happened."</p><br><p>Douglas shook his head with frowning eyebrows, showing that Silvana was badly mistaken.</p><br><p>"Earlier, Damien already hammered Adam into the wall, these wounds are not from colliding with the solid stone slabs, but from Damien's energy and the force of the attack that went through Adam's entire body in a moment."</p><br><p>Dahla nodded, taking a step back, it seemed she was ready to go to the rescue again.</p><br><p>"Most likely, if it wasn't for his threads absorbing part of the damage, his organs would have exploded, though... from what I can see, his organs are badly damaged." Dahla narrowed her eyes looking at Adam, who had fallen to the ground with his eyes wide from shock.</p><br><p>Adam leaned his hands on the floor, while blood continued to flow from his mouth in a powerful stream. His limbs and bones were intact, but... it was the internal wounds that could be the most dangerous.</p><br><p>"Hey, Adam, if you take this long to recover, you're going to die in your next fight in Dead Lands." Damien smirked, finding himself right in front of Adam.</p><br><p>His powerful aura and threatening words made Adam flinch and despite the pain, he immediately sprang into action.</p><br><p>Instinctively, Adam raised the needle above him, going to block Damien's attack, it was the best thing he could do in this situation.</p><br><p>"Well, well, I can't say it's the right decision, but it looks like you just don't have any other choice." Damien said before doing something that caused Adam's eyes to go wide, filling with fear.</p><br><br><p>Damien gripped the black rod tightly with both hands, his forearms straining to the limit, covered in swollen veins.</p><br><p>"No..." Silvana whispered.</p><br><p>She couldn't stop Damien or somehow affect their fight, but she realized that Adam couldn't block this attack, not even with his needle and thread.</p><br><br><p>Whizzing through the wind currents like a divine punishment, a black rod came crashing down on Adam's needle.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, the long, strong needle, capable of piercing any barrier, snapped in two like a matchstick, thin and fragile.</p><br><p>Then, before Adam could realize anything, the rod plunged into his stomach, turning his organs into a bloody mess.</p><br><p>The force of the attack shattered the stone slabs beneath Adam into small pieces, allowing him to sink into it as if it were loose earth rather than solid ground.</p><br><p>But... Adam wasn't thinking about any of this at the time.</p><br><p>One part of his needle flew off to the side, while the other was knocked out of his hand when Damien's attack reached its target.</p><br><p>So the two parts of his needle were in different areas of the chamber, his weapon was destroyed.</p><br><p>Adam must have felt intense pain, but his mind chose to ignore it, using all of his body's strength and resources to stay alive as long as possible.</p><br><p>The current wounds were different from the ones Damien inflicted before, without an arm or leg it was possible to live for decades, but if the organs were damaged, life could be over in a few minutes.</p><br><p>"3:1, looks like you won't be able to reach a draw, though it was hardly even possible." Damien smirked, stepping aside.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Adam was plunged into darkness, but... it wasn't long before a golden light seemed to descend from the heavens and bring him back. Dahla did her job as she was supposed to.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Why is he inactive?" Douglas was confused.</p><br><p>Dahla completely healed him, she had already returned to the spectator room, but Adam still didn't get up from the ground, continuing to lie with his eyes closed.</p><br><p>"Hey Adam, I know you are conscious. Dahla fully cured all your wounds. If you don't do anything, I'll just attack you."</p><br><p>Damien wasn't lying. Immediately after his words, he strode with a confident gait towards Adam, who was lying in the middle of the chamber.</p><br><p>And... more importantly, Damien was right, Adam could hear him clearly.</p><br><p>'What am I supposed to do...?' Adam internally muttered, 'Use First Order again and summon the needle? 'No... It's useless. He'll just break it, but what option do I have then?'</p><br><br><p>With each of Damien's steps, a slight tremor echoed, growing stronger as if counting down for Adam, showing that he was running out of time.</p><br><p>"It's your decision." Damien shrugged before bringing the rod in for an attack.</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Damien rained the rod straight down on Adam, putting just as much force as before.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam's body came into motion as he got down on one knee and raised his right arm.</p><br><br><p>A purple flash passed through his eyes like a root.</p><br><p>Then, Adam gripped the black rod tightly, effortlessly stopping Damien's attack when purple energy waves appeared around his hand for a moment.</p>
