            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1399: Red Eye Arena (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>When anyone found themselves in a new place and unfamiliar situation, they needed to find a starting point for themselves.</p><br><p>In Adam’s case, it was the Raven Beak and meeting Helasa and Reyla. But that wasn’t enough. He needed to become part of the city, to find his place here, even if he wasn’t going to stay in Izardo for too long.</p><br><p>Fight clubs were a great solution. This way, Adam could not only earn money but also attract the attention of the Hybrids, which was practically his goal for coming to this city.</p><br><p>Sure, in theory, Adam could have done it himself, without Helasa’s help, but that would have been problematic. The idea might not have occurred to him, and what’s more, he didn’t know where the fight clubs were located or which one would be best to go to.</p><br><p>Helasa not only had connections in the city but also knew every important place in Izardo very well. It was her duty as a long-time resident of this city.</p><br><br><p>About 30 minutes after their conversation, Helasa and Adam were heading towards an inconspicuous building somewhere in the middle of Izardo. This alley was not far from the main streets, but it was not popular with citizens and looked rather intimidating.</p><br><p>It didn’t matter that most of the monsters in the city were at the Black Threat Level, among them were many, much weaker monsters, and if they were all roughly equal in strength, then they all posed a danger to each other.</p><br><p>In general, dark alleys like these in Izardo were no different from the streets in the slums of the Citadel, where Adam had spent most of his life. If you weren’t prepared to be in places like this, you would be robbed at best and killed at worst.</p><br><p>Before going out into the city, Helasa tidied herself up. Her disheveled hair, red robe, and dark circles under her eyes were replaced by shoulder-length hair, a sharp, serious gaze, and a long dark coat that showed her importance.</p><br><p>“Hey, I have one question,” Adam asked.</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Helasa raised an eyebrow. “Speak quickly. We’ll be there soon.”</p><br><p>“When we met, you said it was good that I hadn’t told anyone my name before, but aren’t we going to do the same thing? I mean, as soon as I get into the arena, everyone will know my name, it’s part of our plan!”</p><br><p>Helasa nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“That’s right. Because now the situation is different. Now, it will do more good than harm, otherwise, you’ll waste a lot of time and energy just to face a Hybrid, let alone find someone who will come and fight you.”</p><br><br><p>“Don’t forget. You came for the Dark Heart, not just for a regular sparring match. The stakes are high, which means we need as much attention as possible. Fortunately, with your name, that won’t be a big problem. I’m sure of it.”</p><br><p>Helasa pointed to herself with a satisfied smile.</p><br><p>“Also, you’re with me now, which makes things much easier for you. In the worst case, if we run into trouble, we can use Norax’s token. At Izardo, such things are valued and feared, but everything should go smoothly. You and I should be enough.”</p><br><p>She was right. Even though Adam arrived at Izardo with no money, he had Norax’s token, something that even the richest and most influential monsters of Izardo did not have. Now, that token belonged to Helasa, as payment for her help.</p><br><p>They stopped as Helasa pointed to the stairs leading down.</p><br><p>“Here. Follow me and don’t do anything strange. We’ll register you as a new fighter, and I’ll be your first sponsor.”</p><br><p>“Hmm? Sponsor?” Adam tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>Helasa nodded. “This is the Red Eye Arena, one of the largest and most famous arenas for Elder-level fighters. Considering that you are a K4-Phantom, this is our best option. Since it is a prominent arena, more people want to participate and watch than the arena can accommodate.</p><br><p>“Therefore, if someone wants to become a fighter, they must have a sponsor who is obligated to bet a large sum on their fighter’s victory in the very first fight. If you want to be a spectator, there is a similar fee, but it is significantly less.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam nodded as a glint ran across his eyes.</p><br><p>“Hah, that sounds like a great place to make money.”</p><br><p>Helasa chuckled. “That’s what I told you earlier!”</p><br><br><p>They descended a wide staircase for a long time, with only a few amber crystal lanterns lighting their way.</p><br><p>Then, they came to a passageway that ended with a large red door, in front of which stood a tall, two-meter-tall man. His body was large, and his hands and cheeks were covered with sparse stone plates, indicating that his human form was not as perfect as that of the High Elders or Lords.</p><br><p>Still, the management of the Red Eye Arena would not have put him in charge of guarding the entrance to the arena if he couldn’t do his job.</p><br><p>“Ms. Helasa?” The guard raised his thick eyebrow. “I haven’t seen you in a long time. Have you finally decided to watch the fights?”</p><br><p>Helasa shook her head as she pointed to Adam. “Nah, big guy, I brought a fighter here. I assure you, he will be the star of tonight’s arena. No one has seen anything like him in a long time.”</p><br><p>The guard shifted his gaze to Adam. He didn’t see anything remarkable in Adam as his aura was completely hidden.</p><br><p>“That’s unexpected, especially from you, but alright. I need a name, faction affiliation if any, and the entry fee, 10,000 tarnished coins.”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened at such a large sum, but Helasa just handed the guard a pouch with ten four-scar coins. Each coin was worth 1,000 one-scar coins.</p><br><p>“As for the name… Can you write it down with initials? I promise he’ll perform under his full name in the arena.” Helasa purred.</p><br><p>The guard rolled his eyes, but finally nodded.</p><br><p>“Alright, what should I write?” He asked.</p><br><p>Helasa licked her lips as her gaze fell on Adam.</p><br><p>“A. V. That will be enough, won’t it?”</p>
