            <br><br><p>The doors opened as Greg, Adam, and Risha entered the elevator area, moving towards one of the platforms.</p><br><p>Adam turned around looking at the workers about to relax after a hard day's work. They were laughing loudly, patting each other on the shoulders and talking about something.</p><br><p>A slight smile appeared on Adam's face.</p><br><p>'Looks like the Lower Ring is far from hell, doesn't it? I'm sure those guys have dangerous jobs, but they know what they're doing.'</p><br><p>Then, Adam raised his head looking around.</p><br><p>There were rails to some of the platforms as workers continued to extract resources from the second and third floors.</p><br><br><p>With a slight shudder, one of the platforms rose, revealing five silhouettes. Each of them was a Phantom coming from the deeper floors.</p><br><p>Unlike the workers, there was no joy on their faces, instead, they were hurt and greatly disappointed in themselves. Two of them with dark faces were holding their mate who was passed out and lost his left arm.</p><br><p>Risha turned to Adam.</p><br><p>"What do you say? Ready to lose your arm during a fight like this loser? Hah, you may beat me, but I'm sure it's all because of your talent."</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Adam didn't react in any way though Risha hoped he would. He only stuck his hands in his pocket and glanced up.</p><br><p>"If that happens you'll have a chance to see my reaction."</p><br><br><p>A few steps later, Greg stopped at one of the far platforms.</p><br><p>"Here, I was told to send you to the middle level of the Red Zone. I understand you're going to hunt S3 and even S4 monsters. So..." Greg's voice became lower. "You'll definitely find them there. If you can manage it, of course."</p><br><p>Risha frowned, a heavy stride entering the platform. "Pfffft! Don't you dare underestimate me? One day I'll be a K4-Phantom and captain like my brother!"</p><br><p>Greg smiled bitterly looking at the arrogant girl.</p><br><p>"Sure, I'm sure Mr. Orel will be pleased to see you in that position."</p><br><p>Without further ado, Greg walked over to the panel and lowered them down.</p><br><p>Adam looked up, watching as the ring of light above grew smaller and smaller as they descended.</p><br><p>"It looks deep. How long did it take the workers to drill this tunnel?" he asked looking at the shaft covered with metal plates.</p><br><p>Risha crossed her arms over her chest. "It wasn't the workers who did it. Well, I don't know for sure, it was done long before I was born."</p><br><p>Adam was stunned at first but then nodded deeply. Risha was a young one, just like him.</p><br><p>"I used to ask my brother about it and he always said it was done by one of the heads of the Four Beasts. Maybe it was ours, maybe one of the Green Dragon, or whatever it is."</p><br><p>Adam's pupils went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>He realized that if it was the head, such a person wasn't doing it with a pickaxe or a drill.</p><br><p>'Hah... If you remember Orel's words about the battle between the Second Rank Phantoms, then everything falls into place,' he clenched his fists tightly as the platform continued to descend. 'I, with my stamina and ability would have taken years to do this.'</p><br><p>Only two minutes later, the platform came to a smooth stop, sliding into the puzzle.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the temperature had risen considerably, and bursts of flame were ready to scald anyone.</p><br><p>Adam stepped off the platform, turning around with curiosity in his eyes.</p><br><p>He expected to see narrow caves or abandoned mines, but instead, he was greeted by a myriad of scarlet crystals shining in the darkness like stars in the night sky. Lakes of lava bubbled in the distance, while magma flowed in wide furrows among the hot black stone, long since dried and devoid of even a drop of water.</p><br><p>Once they were here, Risha's attitude changed. She looked around warily, afraid that some monster might be ambushing them.</p><br><p>Then, goosebumps ran through Risha's body, she noticed something.</p><br><p>"Bastards! I see you!" she shouted pointing at the seemingly unremarkable stone peaks.</p><br><br><p>It seemed that Risha's instincts were wrong.</p><br><p>But, just as she intensified her aura, the rocks suddenly came into motion.</p><br><p>Several lizards with scales as black as stone scattered to the sides, surrounding Risha.</p><br><p>Out of habit, Adam reached up to his ear to ask Silvana what those monsters were, but before he could touch the nonexistent microphone, he heard her voice.</p><br><p>'Hello! Hehehe... I'm still not used to communicating like this, but I should let you know that these are the Obsidian Lizards. There's nothing special about them, they can do everything the same as other fire monsters, though their defense might be a problem for many K3-Phantoms.</p><br><p>'This is Red Zone, so almost all monsters here are Red Threat Level, these lizards are no exception. It's an S2 monster, so I think Risha should be able to handle them on her own, though you can help her if you want.'</p><br><p>With an excited smile, Adam was about to say something to her when a rumbling sound came from outside.</p><br><br><p>The rock fell to the ground with a rumble, but no splinters flew sideways. The rocks shook, revealing a massive lizard that was several times larger than the others.</p><br><p>Two red streaks ran from its predatory red eyes, and along its tail was a fiery line ready to burst into flames at any moment.</p><br><p>"Oh, I take it this is a Prime Obsidian Lizard?" Adam suggested nonchalantly.</p><br><p>Silvana didn't answer right away, she turned around over her shoulder looking at Misa who was drinking coffee.</p><br><p>With a slight smile, Misa nodded, and then she showed three fingers.</p><br><p>'Yes...' Silvana mumbled uncertainly. 'And, it looks like it's an S3 monster. Now, this will be a serious challenge for Risha. Not all S3 monsters are equal, but she had a hard time defeating such an opponent last time. I suggest you help her out.'</p><br><br><p>Adam uttered and walked over to the nearest rock. With a wave of his hand, he brushed away the dust and sat down with one leg thrown over the other.</p><br><p>It wasn't just Risha who was stumped, but the lizards as well, they were preparing to fight against the two Phantoms.</p><br><p>"Go Risha! You can win! I believe in you!" Adam mockingly encouraged her.</p><br><p>"You... You piss me off more and more each time!"</p><br><br><p>The two lizards wasted no time and pounced on Risha - this was their chance.</p><br><br><p>Risha pulled out of his pocket a ring with a crystal inside, the same one the three thugs had.</p><br><p>It was what Adam was waiting for.</p>
