            <br><p>Monsters and humans alike met death at one point, some did so with pride, some desperately tried to fight for their lives, and some simply accepted their fate.</p><br><p>The Blind Commander was no exception to this rule, except for one detail - he wasn't going to die.</p><br><br><p>As soon as the ice walls shattered under the hail of blades, the Blind Commander ran forward, about to emerge from the crimson cloud.</p><br><p>Yet, even though he had an impressive speed, he was not fast enough.</p><br><p>The blades were going to shred his back, the Blind Commander realized that, so he turned around to block at least some of them with his sword.</p><br><p>However, in the next moment, something happened that he didn't expect, or rather, he couldn't calculate it since he saw this ability for the first time.</p><br><p>The blades cut through the air as well, so in a short period of time there were many gaps, the vacuums where the air soon rushed to fill the voids.</p><br><p>Many air pockets, tiny swirls caused them to simultaneously disperse, returning the area to its normal state and throwing out a wind blast.</p><br><br><p>The Blind Commander tried to sprint away, despite his body being covered in dozens of cuts and blood running down his legs, yet he didn't have time.</p><br><p>The ice sword fell out of his hands, clattering off the stone platform while the shockwave threw the Blind Commander off the spire.</p><br><p>This time there was no debris or any object he could bounce back to the battlefield, and... he didn't seem to have the strength to do so.</p><br><br><p>With a deafening rumble, the Blind Commander slammed into a pile of sacks, the wooden crates below cracking under the pressure.</p><br><p>Several of the Shadow Walkers looked back, watching the strongest monster in the fortress, its defeat, and its blood flowing down the nearest staircase.</p><br><p>The Blind Commander made no attempt to rise, he was drained of his powers, his weapons, and had failed the challenge he created himself.</p><br><br><p>A stream of flame with a hovering rune appeared not far from the Blind Commander as if trying to bring him to his senses, to help him return to his rightful place. Continue your journey on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>The Shadow Walkers glanced over as they took a few steps back in a frightened way. Even though the Blind Commander was badly injured, they were not going to compete with him for the rune.</p><br><p>Yet, the Blind Commander didn't even turn his head, he breathed slowly, not wanting to fight anymore.</p><br><br><br><p>Adam walked slowly, feeling a muffled pain echoing throughout his body.</p><br><p>His hands shook, barely able to withstand the power he was using to defeat him.</p><br><p>"Agh... I don't know what exactly happened now, but as strange as it sounds, I've become stronger during this fight."</p><br><p>Then, he glanced at his hands, looking closely at the black rings.</p><br><p>Unconsciously, Adam found himself in his inner space, not far from the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>"What? You want something from me?"</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree had not expected such a reaction from Adam. Well, its confusion did not last long:</p><br><p>[Hahaha... Why are you so disgruntled...? Though I can't know that for sure... but... I doubt that kind of thing most Phantoms do with their Two Walls...]</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, the Evolution Tree's powerful voice filled his mind.</p><br><p>[Adam... You insolent... arrogant bastard... and... it elevated you to the next stage...]</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head with a frowning eyebrow.</p><br><p>"Are you praising me or scolding me? I can't figure it out."</p><br><p>[Both... Next time, you might not be so lucky...]</p><br><p>A smirk slowly traveled across Adam's face, taking Evolution Tree's words as a challenge.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you might be right, but I might also get even luckier. Luck can't be controlled, someone can get lucky ten times in a row and there's no guarantee that it won't happen on the eleventh."</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree grunted, unwilling to accept that Adam was right, at least mathematically.</p><br><p>[It doesn't matter... no one gets lucky all the time... sooner or later you're going to get a low odds and then you're in serious trouble...]</p><br><p>In response, Adam only shrugged nonchalantly before glancing back over his shoulder.</p><br><p>The First Wall was hovering amidst the darkness as before, while the Second Wall was in the seal.</p><br><p>Unlike the Evolution Tree, Adam couldn't see what had happened here but could sense that it was connected to them.</p><br><p>Realizing what Adam was thinking, the Evolution Tree trembled:</p><br><p>[When the time comes... you'll understand... you've already taken a few steps forward before it should happen...]</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand:</p><br><p>"Did you want something from me? From the looks of it, the Blind Commander will not return, but I must move on. I'm still alone among dozens of monsters."</p><br><p>[Sure... It won't take long... I just think... That you should look at what's important right now...]</p><br><p>At the same moment, something caught Adam's gaze.</p><br><p>Quite close to the Evolution Tree, hovered two black rings, his Nexus. Then, Adam's eyes headed in the other direction towards his changed artifact.</p><br><p>'Wait... I'm not sure if it makes any difference, but... The artifact and Nexus moved much closer to the Evolution Tree and each other...'</p><br><p>[Hah... I can see by the look on your face that you're curious... In that case... what are you waiting for? Look at your new Nexus...]</p><br><p>"Oh, come on, do you really think I'm not familiar with my weapon?"</p><br><p>With a confident smirk, Adam extended his right hand forward, palm open.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, at his will, the two rings found themselves in his hand.</p><br><br><p>Two rings created in a burst of pain by an entity incapable of feeling pain, in the despair and anger of their future owner, thanks to his will - all to quench his desires.</p><br><p>It is proof of movement along a chosen path. Two intertwining hands, different yet stuck together in an endless circle.</p><br><p>Still, these are violations of the future, violations of the course of one personal destiny...]</p><br><p>A short laugh escaped Adam's lips.</p><br><br><p>He gripped the rings tightly, with a confident stare.</p><br><p>"This is pretty scary, but, it's time to get back to the real world."</p><br><p>At the same moment, his eyes reflected the ice sword, waiting for someone to pick it up to get the last key.</p>
