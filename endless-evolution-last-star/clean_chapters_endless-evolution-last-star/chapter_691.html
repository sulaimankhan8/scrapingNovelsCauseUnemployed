            <br><p>Whether Adam liked it or not, he needed to activate two more statues to go further - those were the rules of the External Artifact here and he couldn't ignore them.</p><br><p>For some people the extra quest would not be a serious problem, it might be good news to take a break and think about the situation, yet Adam was not one of them.</p><br><p>He wanted to find out what was behind the statues as soon as possible, and he wasn't attracted to the idea of wandering around the huge fortress looking for purple spheres or anything like that.</p><br><p>It seemed that his wish was granted - the intimidating monster was staring right at him, not about to refuse the challenge to fight.</p><br><p>Like Adam, the monster didn't want to waste any time, if they could face each other now, then so be it.</p><br><br><p>Bouncing off the ceiling, a massive shadow swept before Adam's eyes, crashing to the ground like a meteorite.</p><br><p>A cloud of dust rose high up, slowly dispersing to reveal the creature in all its glory.</p><br><p>It was the Mighty Commander, a monster as strong as or even stronger than the Solitary Commander.</p><br><p>In addition to what Adam already realized thanks to the shadows covering the monster's outline, he could see its tough hide covered in some key places by protruding stone outgrowths.</p><br><p>Mighty Commander's legs and paws were devoid of sharp claws or protective scales, but the muscles and bones were so large and dense that it was enough to cause an earthquake with its stomp.</p><br><p>It was obvious that Mighty Commander wouldn't slash Adam with his claws or try to sink his sharp fangs into him, which he didn't have.</p><br><p>Mighty Commander had one weapon - brute pure force.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes intently looking for what on Mighty Commander could be the key, and soon he found the answer to his question:</p><br><p>Two stone bracelets covered the Mighty Commander's wrists, a few cracks running from one edge to the other, but it wasn't enough to shatter them.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Are these his shackles or his weapons? Either way, I doubt he's here for no reason. He's been following me from the moment I entered the caverns and...'</p><br><p>Adam ran his gaze over the Mighty Commander's huge body before frowning.</p><br><p>'He's so big, strong, and heavy, and yet I only felt him, but I couldn't see, hear or notice him. That's alarming... I guess his impressive size doesn't make him a slow, lumbering giant.'</p><br><br><p>As if unwilling to wait any longer, the Mighty Commander let out several loud growls like a beast, splashing his saliva around.</p><br><br><p>With a loud crunch, the Mighty Commander turned his head more than 180 degrees, effortlessly making several full rotations.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Heavy paws pounded against the ground, while powerful jaws and blunt teeth clattered rapidly, emitting a frightening echo that was just the epitome of the Mighty Commander's impatience.</p><br><p>A slight smile appeared on Adam's face as he placed his hands at his sides.</p><br><p>"Hah, you're so eager to start fighting, and yet you don't attack? You're pretty damn polite, for a monster, I can't help but admit it."</p><br><p>Then, his expression shifted in a moment, becoming cold and focused. Instead of summoning the needle or using any of his other abilities, Adam took a step back and leaned forward deeply.</p><br><p>He spread his legs and arms wider, changing his center of gravity for the greatest stability. It was the kind of stance an experienced man would use to stop a fast and strong beast of suitable size and strength.</p><br><p>Some strongman might have taken the risk of using such a stance to stop or at least slow down a real bull, but... the Mighty Commander was clearly a creature from a completely different league.</p><br><p>Moreover, unlike the Solitary Commander who was even smaller than the Dark Watchers, the Mighty Commander was much larger. If they were to fight, the Mighty Commander would crush the Dark Watcher with a single blow of his fist.</p><br><br><p>The Mighty Commander abruptly returned his head to its normal position, his eye wide open in a baffled look at Adam.</p><br><p>"Come on. You're not stupid enough not to realize what I want to do."</p><br><p>Adam's fingers spread as he exhaled a cold vapor passing in front of his blue, focused eyes.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, the Mighty Commander pulled out his long tongue licking his mouth as if he saw something very tasty or something that caused him to be excited.</p><br><p>His joy was understandable to anyone, he even trembled slightly with anticipation.</p><br><p>"Hah, you remind me of a certain monster. That bastard ate my right arm... I hope I won't have that problem with you."</p><br><p>'Adam... Are you sure?' Silvana's lips quivered, she was scared looking at the difference in their size.</p><br><p>A sly grin covered his face with a dangerous glint running across his eyes.</p><br><p>"Sure, we're both sure of that, aren't we?"</p><br><br><p>Not willing to wait another moment, the Mighty Commander tore forward, waves of dust left behind his dash.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Every time the Mighty Commander's limbs touched the surface, the ground shook, a tremor traveling all the way to the top, making the stalactites quiver and the light from the bright crystals ripple.</p><br><p>As Adam had expected, despite his size, the Mighty Commander was not slow, on the contrary, it was one of the fastest opponents he ever faced. Find your adventure at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>The Mighty Commander carried forward like a shadow, appearing in all its majesty in front of Adam in a matter of seconds.</p><br><br><p>Opening his jaw wide and raising one paw upward, the Mighty Commander prepared to attack Adam, who seemed too stunned by his speed to have time to do anything about it.</p><br><p>Yet, before the Mighty Commander could finish his attack, purple streams of energy reflected in his large eye.</p><br><br><p>A black flash swept forward, smashing straight into the Mighty Commander's face.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, as if the Mighty Commander weighed no more than a sack of sand, his huge body flew dozens of meters back from Adam, with such speed and force that his silhouette once again turned into a shadow.</p><br><br><p>The Mighty Commander's broad back pierced the waterfall's stream, disappearing into the depths of the solid wall that shattered under the momentum of Adam's punch.</p>
