            <br><p>Prime Thunder Demon had almost reached the center of the volcano, Adam, Katrin and the others had little time. They had to quickly decide what to do and their plan had to be simple and effective.</p><br><p>"Sure. There's already a plan, in fact, nothing tricky, but I wouldn't say it's going to be easy." Katrin smirked throwing a glance at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, listening to her intently.</p><br><p>"Pretty much. It's simple. Let him dive inside the volcano and devour the larva king. Anyway, our main objective is to prevent the emergence of the Igno Ant King, so if there is no larva there will be no king." Katrin waved her hand.</p><br><br><p>"Sure, it's risky because Thunder Demon can evolve and then all we have to do is run away and pray that the monster doesn't catch up with us, but..." Katrin's corners of her mouth went up, "It takes a long time to evolve, so we'll have time to kill it."</p><br><p>"How?" Adam asked in a calm voice, while his hair fluttered slightly, either from the lightning or from the light wind currents.</p><br><p>Katrin glanced at Oskar as she sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"Right after Thunder Demon sinks into the lava, we'll just unleash all of our most powerful attacks on it. The volcano will explode, the energy will tear Thunder Demon apart and we'll finally be done with this ant story." Katrin explained.</p><br><p>"Good, then we'll start right now. I take it you guys are ready now, right?" Adam asked looking at the Golden Light Squad.</p><br><p>Oskar, Erla, Lero, and Osana nodded. While they were running here they had already discussed the plan in detail, so each of them knew what they had to do.</p><br><p>Then, they quickly headed towards the top of the volcano to which Thunder Demon had already run up carrying a huge larva king.</p><br><p>"Damn, that bastard actually looks threatening. And... You had to defeat a stronger Thunder Demon to survive in Salt Village, didn't you?" Oskar asked staring at Thunder Demon, who was on the other side of the volcano.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon glanced at the squad, smirked, and jumped right into the center. By his logic, everything had happened exactly as he'd planned - he'd made it in time and the Phantoms were too late.</p><br><p>Thus, all he had to do was eat the larva king using the lava layer for protection and evolution. After that, none of the Phantoms could do anything to him.</p><br><p>Well, Thunder Demon's idea was amazingly thoughtful for a monster, but, he didn't take into account one important detail - by diving inside the volcano, he was making this place his prison.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon was only going to get out of the volcano after devouring the larva king and evolving, which meant that all this time, he would be trapped here.</p><br><p>"Lero, get started." Oskar said seriously.</p><br><p>"Sure." Lero nodded and opened his books again.</p><br><p>This time, the scarlet light was much brighter and more active, showing that this ability surpassed the last one by several magnitudes.</p><br><p>Lero frowned as he clenched his teeth tightly. The supports helped others, but there was a price to pay.</p><br><p>Then, in the depths of the volcano, covering all the lava beneath it, a massive scarlet magic circle appeared.</p><br><p>It might have seemed that Lero's Nexus Traits were very similar to each other, as both abilities featured red magic circles. Well, that wasn't quite the case.</p><br><p>Last time Lero had used his ability to strengthen Oskar, now he had created a magic circle that would make every attack that passed through it much more powerful.</p><br><p>Around the edges of the magic circle were six transparent crystals, showing that the magic circle could only amplify six attacks, after that its energy would run out and Lero would have to create a new one. .net</p><br><p>Considering that he had used his Nexus twice in less than ten minutes, he needed a rest to avoid facing serious consequences.</p><br><p>"Well done, Katrin, now you. You promised you would use your Second Nexus Trait." Oskar said glaring at her.</p><br><p>Katrin rolled her eyes, snorting irritably.</p><br><p>"Fine, I'm only doing this because Thunder Demon is there. I still need to save my powers for the battle against Scarlet Pyromancer, you know?" Katrin sighed heavily before tapping her staff on the ground.</p><br><p>Her eyes sparkled as the green energy traveled along the staff quickly sinking into the ground.</p><br><p>It was unlikely that anything could grow right on top of an active volcano with only ash and lava flows everywhere, but that was no obstacle to Katrin's ability.</p><br><p>'Soon there will be nothing left of these abilities. Well, maybe it's not a bad thing that I have a chance to use them now.' Katrin internally muttered as her gaze became exhausted.</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Katrin removed her staff from the ground. She like Lero had already used two Nexus abilities, so... for now, she could only rely on her Orders.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The ground shook, releasing a multitude of roots that headed towards a single point. Thick roots became the base, while small ones wove around the thick ones like vines.</p><br><p>Soon, not far from Katrin appeared a massive flower with six yellow petals bearing several brightly colored stamens that emitted pollen.</p><br><p>But... the pollen had a precise purpose - to fall on Katrin's allies.</p><br><p>Slowly but surely, like snowflakes or tiny particles of honey, the amber pollen fell on Adam, then on Oskar, and soon reached Erla and the others.</p><br><p>Everyone felt a surge of strength as their bodies grew stronger and the amount of energy increased.</p><br><p>"Wow... What are the effects of this pollen?" Lero asked with some admiration. He couldn't boast of such abilities.</p><br><p>Katrin narrowed her eyes, not wanting to say anything since she didn't like her abilities, but when she saw Lero's sincere smile, she changed her mind.</p><br><p>'Well, it won't do any harm if I satisfy his curiosity.' Katrin internally muttered before catching a piece of pollen.</p><br><p>"A general increase in physical capabilities, but that's just a nice bonus. The main purpose of the pollen is to increase your energy and speed up its recovery. So it'll take you less than an hour to use Nexus again, instead of several hours like normal." Katrin said quickly.</p><br><p>Adam glanced at the pollen, nodded slightly, and stared at Osana.</p><br><p>"Hey, are you going to participate?"</p><br><p>Osana smiled sweetly.</p><br><p>"Nah, I've already used my enhancement on you. My other abilities are for other purposes." Osana tilted her head examining Adam.</p><br><p>"Well, we, the supports..." Osana glanced at Katrin who frowned heavily at her words, "We've done all that was required of us. Now, it's your turn."</p><br><p>Adam, Oskar, and Erla nodded before walking over to the volcano, looking at the bubbling lava through the magic circle.</p><br><p>'Hey, you can use your Nexus. I think it'll be a lot more effective than a needle throw.' Silvana said in a calm voice, 'With all the reinforcements you have on you right now, this will be your most powerful attack ever.'</p><br><p>Adam nodded as he looked at his fingers amongst which electric shocks occasionally passed through.</p><br><p>'Damn... My new artifact ability is much stronger than the last one, but in this situation, I could use my lightning strike from the sky. That ability helped me win more than one battle.' Adam internally muttered, channeling energy towards his gloves.</p><br><p>At this time, Oskar and Erla proceeded to prepare their abilities. They had time, but they still had to hurry, for the Thunder Demon was about to start devouring the larva king.</p>
