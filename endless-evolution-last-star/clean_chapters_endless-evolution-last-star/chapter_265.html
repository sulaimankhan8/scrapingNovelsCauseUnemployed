            <br><br><p>Pod fell to the ground while the protective glass slowly lowered, finally releasing Snow Follower from the cage.</p><br><p>However, from Magnus's telling it was now clear that Snow Follower desired to stay here. They, unlike most monsters, did not fight for strength or survival, but to satisfy their interest.</p><br><p>In a way, their image suited them perfectly, especially their weapon, the katana. No greed, no rage, no madness, just patience, waiting, and even a kind of nobility that literally emanated from them like an invisible aura.</p><br><p>Snow Follower, looked around. First, he looked at Magnus and nodded slightly, as if thanking him for the opportunity.</p><br><p>In fact, it was possible to understand Snow Follower. He acted differently from the other monster in his place, but considering that interest was the most important thing to him, it was clear.</p><br><p>It was hard for Snow Follower to find a more interesting fight than against the world's only hybrid.</p><br><p>If he had killed Nessa a year ago, he would have lost a unique opportunity. For this fight, he was willing to wait as long as it took for Nessa to become strong enough.</p><br><p>Then, Snow Follower's blue eyes, while his snow-white hair rippled, headed towards Silvana.</p><br><p>Snow Follower frowned slightly, it seemed he was not pleased that someone unworthy was here.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Snow Follower's aura came out, exuding a coldness and intense pressure that caused Silvana to shiver all over her body.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide, she found it hard to breathe as she clutched at her heart and was ready to fall to the ground at any moment.</p><br><br><p>Silvana's eyes reflected a white gleam as she felt light, all the pressure instantly evaporated and she was surrounded by the white flame that radiated from Adam.</p><br><p>"Hey, you came here to fight a hybrid, not a mere human who even has trouble breathing in front of you. Is there any interest in this for you? I find that hard to believe." Adam said calmly.</p><br><p>Snow Follower tilted his head slightly.</p><br><p>His serene eyes slowly traveled over Adam, then the monster nodded and his aura calmed.</p><br><p>Adam turned to Silvana.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah... thank you..." Silvana answered intermittently, trying to normalize her breathing.</p><br><p>Then, Adam looked around and his gaze stopped on Magnus.</p><br><p>'How strange... This is his lab, but he's still a simple man, isn't he? Not only was he not afraid of Golden Spearman and Snow Follower, but unlike Silvana, he had no problem with withstanding Snow Follower's aura. Hmm... that bastard clearly still has a lot of secrets, however, it's not surprising.' Adam pondered.</p><br><br><p>Nessa took a step forward. It looked uncertain, but with each further step, her stride grew stronger and there was only determination in her gaze.</p><br><p>"I didn't expect my father to make me fight you today. After all, you're far above my level, but... I won't lose this time. That's for sure." Nessa said seriously, stopping right in front of Snow Follower.</p><br><p>Nessa was a rather tall girl, but Snow Follower was still taller, so... he looked down at her serenely. So far, not considering her worthy.</p><br><br><p>Magnus clapped his hands together drawing attention to himself.</p><br><p>"I understand that you're already anxious to fight, but... I think you realize that this isn't the best place for a battle of this level." Magnus spoke with an excited smile as he waved his hand.</p><br><br><p>Snow Follower came close to him, glaring threateningly at Magnus, but that didn't make the smirk go away from his face.</p><br><p>Then, Snow Follower slowly swung his katana pointing at the dozens of pods that contained kids, mostly girls.</p><br><p>It was as if Snow Follower was saying, 'I don't care about them. I don't intend to wait any longer. I will destroy them if I have to.'</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, I understand you, but if you do that, that guy's going to be pissed." Magnus pointed at Adam, causing Snow Follower to turn around.</p><br><p>Their gazes clashed. Snow Follower's eyes narrowed, glaring at Adam's cold stare.</p><br><p>"I doubt that instead of fighting Nessa, you want to be beaten by him. Hahaha." Magnus chuckled, enjoying the situation.</p><br><p>"Alright, everyone follows me. There's a suitable place for the two of you here." Magnus waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><br><p>A few passages later, after descending one floor below, they found themselves in a huge room large enough to be an airplane hangar or a giant supermarket with several floors.</p><br><p>The room, walls, floor, and ceilings, were made up of white blocks that gave off a strange aura, showing that they weren't made of ordinary materials like stone or concrete. This was something special.</p><br><p>Nessa and Snow Follower stood twenty meters away from each other, waiting for a command from Magnus.</p><br><p>Silvana, Magnus, and Adam were in a room at the top of the hall. They were far enough away that random attacks wouldn't hit them, moreover, they were protected by a special barrier.</p><br><p>"Hey, you said that the mission department gave Snow Follower Top-9 as an advance. They don't have enough data for a more accurate ranking, but... what's your opinion? What is Snow Follower capable of if he fights at his limit?" Adam asked.</p><br><p>He was fully confident, especially after their auras clashed, that Snow Follower could even enter the Top-5.</p><br><p>Magnus looked up at the ceiling thoughtfully rubbing his chin.</p><br><p>"Well... it all depends on the situation, but I would say that under certain circumstances, Snow Follower could defeat North Keeper. However, we don't have any record of those two monsters fighting, so this is all just my speculation." Magnus waved his hand carelessly.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes widened for a moment.</p><br><p>After all, North Keeper was a Top-4 monster while Snow Follower was a Top-9.</p><br><p>There should be a serious difference between the two.</p><br><p>"Well, I won't keep you waiting any longer." Magnus said into the microphone, his voice filling the room.</p><br><br><br><p>However, Nessa and Snow Follower did not budge.</p><br><p>Nessa clenched her fists tightly, getting into a fighting stance, glaring intently at Snow Follower. He like any Crown Monster was most dangerous in close combat, however, that was also Nessa's strong point.</p><br><br><p>Snow Follower took a few steps, but not forward, but backward. He glanced at Nessa, then looked at his katana and thrust his weapon into the floor, showing that for now, he didn't need it.</p><br><p>"Damn, is he messing with her?" Adam uttered, not noticing the slight smirk that appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"Well... Over this year Nessa has honed her skills, last year's defeat was a big lesson for her. However... I'm not sure it will be enough to defeat one of the Top-10 of the Purple Threat Level monsters." Magnus said seriously, "That would be Nessa's milestone..."</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes. It seemed to him that Magnus was hiding something about Nessa, until now.</p><br><p>'Hopefully, that secret will come out in this fight.' Adam thought shifting his gaze to Nessa.</p><br><p>Snow Follower's action had infuriated her.</p><br><p>"Bastard! You think I'm weak?!" Nessa gritted her teeth and lunged forward, intending to attack first.</p><br><br><p>Before she could realize anything, Snow Follower appeared in front of her, grabbing her hair with one hand as his fist plunged into her stomach, piercing her steel abs.</p><br><p>"Argh!" Nessa's eyes went wide at the bright pain running through her entire body.</p>
