            <br><p>After meeting Adam and Silvana a few hours later, Glara went to the store to get groceries, she wasn't in the mood for that, but there was no way out since the stress of the last few days caused her and her parents to eat almost everything they had.</p><br><p>In fact, she decided that it would help her to let go of her heavy thoughts, there was no point in going deeper and deeper into grief, Glara realized that, but it was hard to get away from such a tragedy so quickly.</p><br><p>But... there was more than one meeting waiting for her today, Glara only found that out when she crashed into a man in an elegant suit, however, it was the kind of clothes that were perfect for him, who looked impeccable, cunning and attractive, like a butler of some important person.</p><br><p>If some experienced Phantom or military man had been in Glara's place, they would have immediately sensed the strange aura emanating from this man, the danger would make them wary.</p><br><p>However, that was hardly possible for Glara. She was a simple person who wasn't even going to connect her life with Dead Lands, as she studied not at the academy to become an Operator or military, but at the institute. In a way, she was innocence itself.</p><br><p>"Morton Observatory...? What is this place?" Glara tilted her head in confusion, taking the man's hand.</p><br><p>Slowly and carefully, the man lifted her off the ground, then without saying anything he bent down and gathered up the food scattered on the ground, taking the bag in his hand.</p><br><p>"I have come from there to escort you to one of the smartest people in our world. So, what is your answer, will you follow me?" The man leaned over, extending his hand to her with a sly smile on his face.</p><br><p>Glara gulped, she didn't expect such an offer from a man she didn't know at all.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry, but I'll probably decline, maybe sometime later? Now is not the best time for random encounters... Moreover, I don't even know your name." Glara cast her gaze to the side, she was both confused and embarrassed.</p><br><p>The man in front of her had all the necessary qualities to make a young girl like her blush.</p><br><p>"Oh, right, how uncultured of me." The man smiled gently taking Glara's hands in his. Their gazes met, she could see her reflection in his blue, clear-as-the-sky eyes.</p><br><p>"My name is Gladius, nice to meet you Glara."</p><br><p>Glara blinked a few times, about to introduce herself in response, but soon her eyes went wide with realization.</p><br><p>"What...? How do you know my name?"</p><br><p>Gladius answered nothing, instead, he pointed to his belt where somehow there was a red book, Lero's Nexus.</p><br><p>"Agh...? How? I definitely left it at home..." Glara muttered in a trembling voice, gradually she began to realize that she better avoid this encounter.</p><br><p>Gladius smirked, releasing Glara's hand.</p><br><p>"Well, I decided to pick it up beforehand so I wouldn't have to go back and waste time." Gladius explained before glancing at his watch.</p><br><p>Glara didn't know it, but then Gladius looked at his NEP, which was different from the NEPs of the other Phantoms, it was black with a purple frame. It seemed that the appearance of his NEP didn't have any hidden meaning, it just went well with his appearance that he carefully chose.</p><br><p>"Oh, I'm sorry, but our time is coming to an end. Well, you weren't going to agree anyway, so don't blame me for what happened." Gladius shrugged nonchalantly as if it was no big deal, they were just in a hurry.</p><br><p>"No... Get away from me... I don't want to be a part of anything weird!" Glara uttered, taking steps back and away from Gladius.</p><br><br><p>Gladius's free hand turned into a shadow. A gleam flickered in Glara's eyes as the thin needle plunged into her neck, a second later the syringe was empty and Glara's eyes clouded over.</p><br><p>Her legs went limp as she fell to the ground.</p><br><br><p>Stepping forward, with a deft movement of his arm, Gladius caught Glara like a dancer catching his partner during a complex movement, his gracefulness was enough for both of them.</p><br><p>"Phew, made it in time. The last few weeks have been quite challenging for you, haven't they?" Gladius smiled, looking at the already sleeping Glara who hadn't heard him.</p><br><p>Stepping aside, Gladius carefully placed Glara in the car, in the back seat, remembering to put the grocery bag next to her.</p><br><p>No one could interrupt him, as Gladius specifically chose this spot, where it was dark and people rarely passed by. Moreover, he did everything quickly.</p><br><br><p>Closing the door, Gladius got behind the driver's seat and the car touched off, heading towards one of the farthest points of the Citadel - Morton Observatory.</p><br><p>"First your birthday, then your brother's death, when you met with Adam Vinter something happened to you... It's quite curious." Gladius muttered, pondering the situation.</p><br><p>Even though he just kidnapped Glara, he wasn't a villain or a criminal, he was simply doing his job where his personal interest was involved.</p><br><p>Gladius was one of those people who helped Aiden Henk bring his crazy ideas and assumptions to life.</p><br><p>Gladius cast a final glance at the sleeping Glara before the car disappeared into the shadows.</p><br><p>"Hmm... It's entirely possible that this isn't the end for the Fratto Family, not that I care, but this is an unusual situation."</p><br><br><p>The hot steam from two cups of coffee drifted in front of the two people who felt the tension even though they shouldn't have.</p><br><p>"So... You want to end our relationship, did I understand you correctly?" Jena asked looking at Adam, there was a slight, expected sadness in her gaze.</p><br><br><p>"Mostly I agreed because it was something new and unexpected for me. I think I was driven by interest since I didn't develop any powerful feelings for you that I could call love."</p><br><p>Jena smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"Well, it's good that you finally said that. You may not be my man, but you are a man. I get it, you're probably thinking about Dead Lands and monsters right now, not relationships, and you're younger than me." Jena smiled, she took this news much easier than Adam expected.</p><br><p>Then, before Adam could say anything, Jena walked over to him and took him firmly by the collar, sitting down on his lap.</p><br><p>"You're not ready for a serious relationship yet, for a variety of reasons, but... that doesn't mean we should stop communicating. What's more, a young man like you needs regular sex!" Jena exclaimed with an excited expression before kissing him deeply, leaving no room for argument.</p><br><p>Perhaps, Adam wanted to pull Jena away from him, but the desire to feel pleasure and relax in the gentle embrace quickly consumed him.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, his hands found themselves on Jena's body, giving him complete freedom of action.</p><br><p>Fighting against Plague Reaper, the deaths of his fellows, and killing hundreds of monsters in dangerous situations was a heavy stress for any Phantom, Adam was no exception.</p><br><p>His mind and body desperately wanted to rest and relieve himself of the heavy weight and... when Jena herself moved into action, he could no longer stop.</p>
