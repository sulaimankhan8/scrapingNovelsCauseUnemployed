            <br><p>Snow Follower had received wounds, not fatal, especially for him, but it showed that he could no longer be careless.</p><br><p>With every clash, a small fight between the two of them, Nessa grew stronger. Moreover, Magnus's words raised her morale and enhanced Nessa's abilities.</p><br><p>Even the greatest warrior, sometimes needed support, especially if it came from someone important.</p><br><p>Once the katana was firmly clutched in Snow Follower's hand, the whole situation changed completely.</p><br><p>Nessa felt the invisible pressure coming from Snow Follower because unlike him, she had no weapon. Only her body and instincts.</p><br><p>"By the way... He's called Snow Follower for a reason, isn't he? I mean, I can see snow particles coming from his katana, but I don't really see how snow can be a weapon." Adam muttered scratching his cheek.</p><br><p>He had fought many opponents and some of them had unusual abilities. Sure, water, earth, or fire wasn't anything surprising, but sound, glass, or gravity could be a shock to inexperienced Phantoms.</p><br><p>But... What about snow?</p><br><p>Snow, ice, and steam were all water, but were in different states. Technically, snow was also ice, because it was made up of snowflakes, tiny crystals with fancy patterns.</p><br><p>However, snow is not as strong and hard as ice, but not as liquid as water, because snow was transformed into ice not from liquid but from vapor.</p><br><p>Usually, the process of becoming snow takes place high above the ground - in the clouds.</p><br><p>Even children knew that whether it rained or snowed depended solely on the temperature, both below and above.</p><br><p>Snow could be dangerous during a blizzard or as a harbinger of severe frost, but was it possible to use snow as a weapon? Maybe one should have thrown snowballs at the opponent? Nah, a really strong snowball is partially composed of ice, not brittle snow.</p><br><p>The snow was completely useless as a weapon, but... only regular snow, not the one filled with the energy of a Top-9 Purple Threat Level monster with superior control over both his body and abilities.</p><br><p>If snow was a useless weapon, it was an excellent tool, and any tool could be a dangerous weapon if it was sharpened and used properly.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Snow Follower's katana trembled as thin streams of snow composed of a million tiny crystals came out of it.</p><br><p>Snow Follower reached forward and pointed the tip of the katana towards the ground, allowing the streams of snow to spread around.</p><br><p>The snow quickly spread throughout the room, reaching even the snow with moving tips as if it were alive.</p><br><p>"Wait... Don't tell me they all obey him..." Adam's eyes went wide. He realized how dangerous a weapon it was.</p><br><br><p>"Sure. And that's not all. Though he's already picked up his weapon, he's still not sure if Nessa is worthy of him fighting her at full strength."</p><br><p>"Tsk. That's so arrogant." Silvana snorted irritably. Bit by bit, she began to cheer for Nessa, Silvana wished that she had won.</p><br><br><p>"Indeed. But... No one can say Snow Follower has no right to act like that. He's strong, and only if Nessa can fight back against him will Snow Follower consider her an equal."</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip. Then, she glanced at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam didn't need to fight or show his abilities for Snow Follower to recognize him as worthy, in his case just releasing his aura and a few words with a cold stare was enough.</p><br><p>'Nessa has to fight and show the best of her abilities for Snow Follower to gradually become more serious... Damn, the strong ones see each other from afar, don't they?' Silvana pondered with a slight frown, not noticing that she had been actively biting her nails for some time now.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, staring at Silvana puzzled and at her slightly mussed hair, making her face look less stern and harsh.</p><br><p>'Well, well... looks like I was hasty with my last punishment. She really is nicer this way though.' Adam thought with an unnoticed smile on his face.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Snow Follower made the first move. He pointed his katana at Nessa, but he didn't move himself, instead dozens of snow streams performed that task.</p><br><p>Nessa's pupils narrowed as a shiver ran through her body. She realized that even though it was snow, at this density and abundance of energy, it was like living blades striving towards her.</p><br><p>Nessa tilted her body and lunged forward, a moment before a torrent of snow hit her spot, leaving a crater on the floor. Then, several more streams tried to get her, but Nessa successfully dodged each time, quickly approaching the Snow Follower who didn't see her as a threat.</p><br><p>'Great, snow streams are dangerous and fast, but... from the looks of it, he used them all to attack. He's defenseless now!' Nessa internally exclaimed before attacking.</p><br><p>Her fist swiftly headed towards Snow Follower's face, whose azure eyes were calm and serene.</p><br><br><p>Out of nowhere, two streams of snow appeared that clutched around Nessa's wrist, stopping her hand right in front of Snow Follower's face.</p><br><p>Snow Follower's eyes narrowed as he slowly raised his katana, towering over Nessa.</p><br><p>Nessa gulped, realizing that if she didn't get out of the grip now, she would know the full power lurking in Snow Follower's weapon.</p><br><p>'Oh... Perhaps I rushed...' Magnus said inwardly looking at Nessa's confused face.</p><br><p>Her legs came into motion, she tried to run away from Snow Follower as fast as she could, but... her legs wouldn't move. The snow had already enveloped them like the roots of an ancient tree, powerful and unbreakable.</p><br><p>Even by fully tensing her muscles, Nessa was unable to break free from the dense snow.</p><br><p>'Agh... Just smash them... you still have one free hand, don't you?' Adam said to himself, while a frown was increasingly showing on his face, 'Your opponent is showing off, not considering you worthy, giving you plenty of opportunities to attack, but... you can't take advantage of any of them...'</p><br><p>Adam was a spectator in this situation, and spectators tended to comment and judge, especially those who were losing. However, Adam was stronger than Nessa or Snow Follower, so his competence was enough for that.</p><br><p>"Shit! Shit! Shit!" Nessa shouted, trying to break free from Snow Follower's grip, but it was impossible.</p><br><p>At this time, Snow Follower seemed to realize that Nessa was hopeless, so... his slow-moving katana became faster, slicing Nessa's chest diagonally.</p><br><br><p>Nessa's eyes opened wide in disbelief, looking at the drops of blood that flew in front of her face.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Nessa felt no pain, for... the intense cold coming from Snow Follower's katana reduced Nessa's pain to a minimum, though the wound was gruesome.</p><br><p>Only her strong body and sturdy bones saved Nessa from death, otherwise, Snow Follower would have cut her in two and the fight would have been over. </p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, about to intervene. Strangely enough, he was willing to break the rules of the fight so that Nessa would survive.</p><br><br><p>Magnus's hand blocked his path.</p><br><p>"Wait. Don't you dare stop her from growing? You should know there's nothing like your own blood flying before your eyes on the brink of death. It's a catalyst for change."</p>
