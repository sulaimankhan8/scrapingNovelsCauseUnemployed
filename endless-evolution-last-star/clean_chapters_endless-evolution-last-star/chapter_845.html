            <br><p>Every energy had an attribute. Sometimes, it was something obvious. Examples like fire and water were known even to a child who had only recently learned to read.</p><br><p>Lightning, wind, or stone weren't capable of surprising anyone either. Nevertheless, this was only the tip of the iceberg, below hid a bottom with no borders.</p><br><p>It seemed that Tron's ability to use glass as the main material had to be the limit. It wasn't a standard attribute, it wasn't even a combination of standard attributes, for glass was derived from fire and sand.</p><br><p>However, all of this was irrelevant in real combat, any ability was energy, and energy had properties - that was what distinguished one attribute from another in isolation from appearance.</p><br><p>Blue fire and red one looked the same, only the color was different, but one flame froze, and the other burned everything in its path.</p><br><p>Something similar worked for all abilities of all Phantoms or monsters, no matter what form the energy took.</p><br><p>Thus, what was Adam looking at now?</p><br><p>What were the countless stars floating in front of him capable of?</p><br><p>Eager to know the limits of his Global Gene, Adam reached forward with a detached gaze. He expected the stars to do something.</p><br><br><br><p>Confusion reflected on Adam's face. He didn't fully understand how his Global Gene worked, and there was no way he could make any progress on it.</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree couldn't stand by, it decided to help its stumped partner.</p><br><p>[Look... You have to realize that Global Gene has no restrictions, but it does have limits...]</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"Do you even hear what you're saying? This is bullshit! What the fuck does that even mean?!"</p><br><p>[Hmm... Fine, let's take a random Phantom as an example. One of this Phantom's abilities can create a fire spear...]</p><br><br><p>[Flaming Spear, that's his ability, I think it makes sense. Then, this Phantom gains the Global Gene and its attribute is fire. He can now create fire projectiles at will, cause flames to burn down a forest, or even trigger an explosion to destroy a rock.]</p><br><br><p>[Although it is a Global Gene, it is still a fire, it cannot freeze or cool something. It will be weak against water of the same power and cannot be harder than a stone. Sound or gravity will have no trouble affecting fire, but not the other way around.]</p><br><br><p>With a deep gaze, Adam stared pensively into the void. He pondered the Evolution Tree's words with an occasional nod.</p><br><p>After a few minutes, with a final nod, his voice rang out:</p><br><p>"I think I get it. The Global Gene doesn't make you omnipotent, you can't melt ice with water, but... nothing is stopping you from compressing water into a spear and smashing an iceberg."</p><br><p>[Yeah... Something like that. However... don't think your imagination is the only thing holding you back from becoming invincible. The mastery, stamina, and energy are important components.]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree decided to warn before Adam did something reckless:</p><br><p>[First, try doing something simple and effective, something that fits your attribute, energy, and strength exactly...]</p><br><p>"Something simple, right?"</p><br><p>Adam's primary weapon has always been the needle, from the beginning, and still is. He used his needle as a sword most of the time, but the form and style of combat were similar.</p><br><p>What was the simplest movement when using a sword?</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, allowing the energy to surround him. He closed his eyes to settle on the shape and form.</p><br><p>Then, Adam nodded deeply and held his right hand out to the side.</p><br><p>The Global Gene shuddered once when at Adam's will all the energy headed towards his palm. The white stream accumulated in a dense layer along his hand, enveloping the surface.</p><br><p>"Well..." Adam muttered looking forward, "What could be simpler than this?"</p><br><br><p>Adam executed a horizontal arm swing, releasing all the energy in one motion. He imagined doing it, and it worked.</p><br><p>The broad blade swept through the darkness, leaving behind a smooth trail like a natural wave. There were no obstacles or opponents ahead, so soon, the blade dissipated into particles.</p><br><p>Still in shock, Adam lowered his eyes. His fingertips trembled, a mad delight, silent but wild, ran along his body, not reflected on his face but reaching into his gaze.</p><br><p>"I don't know how powerful this blade is, but... when I was a K0 or K1 Phantom this simple swing would be rated as a full-fledged ability. The shape, density, and energy, and there's an intent... everything needed to be an ability from a gene, branch, or artifact."</p><br><p>[Looks like you're finally getting somewhere...]</p><br><p>After a long silence, Adam took a deep breath, then he glared at the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>A bitter smile slowly appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"Yeah, that looked like something promising. The Global Gene... It seems to be the most complex and multifunctional weapon in my arsenal."</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree grunted.</p><br><p>[If I were you, I'd think of it as a tool. You still have energy... That slash was very simple.</p><br><p>Try doing something more complicated, and... you'll realize it right away.]</p><br><p>Adam took some time to think about it. He had many ideas, but he understood that most of them were impossible to do, even if he had a limitless energy supply.</p><br><p>Then, energy reappeared out of nowhere, surrounding his arm up to his elbow in a turbulent torrent. Wasting no time, Adam assumed a fighting stance, he drew one leg back and tilted his torso forward.</p><br><p>Gradually, the energy took the form of a spiral or even a massive drill moving at high speed.</p><br><p>'This is much more serious than what I did earlier... Let's see what happens.'</p><br><p>With those words, Adam shifted forward, thrusting the void.</p><br><p>No sooner had his arm reached the final point than a shiver ran through the energy, in a heartbeat, the vortex covering his arm dissipated into particles.</p><br><br><p>Adam collapsed to one knee as if all his energy faded away in an instant.</p><br><p>[Well... Well... We have a lot of work ahead of us, and it's only the Zero Orb...]</p>
