            <br><p>Adam didn't have time to sort out the details of what happened, he didn't know how or why Silvana decided to do this, but he knew it happened.</p><br><p>She had taken his wound for herself, completely healing his arm. It was the Operator's one-time opportunity to correct the Phantom's mistake, at least while Silvana was so weak. Unlike Adam, her real path had only recently begun.</p><br><p>Still unable to believe what was happening, Adam gripped his left shoulder tightly. It was real, not an illusion or ability, something else.</p><br><p>"Damn, how I long to know everything, but you're right Lone Blaze, I have to fulfill Silvana's hopes."</p><br><br><p>Without a moment's hesitation, Adam flapped his wing, bursting out of the damaged courtyard of the fortress.</p><br><p>He didn't see Katrin's dazed face. She wanted to ask him how he healed his wound, but Adam had no answer.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch had not expected this development as well.</p><br><p>"Unbelievable, his Operator, she was able to do it on that level?"</p><br><p>Then, he nodded deeply, recognizing Silvana's sacrifice at the highest level.</p><br><p>'Looks like my decision not to kill him but to capture him turned out to be the right one.'</p><br><p>The monarch's deep crimson eyes fixed intently on Adam, rushing towards him in a fiery flash.</p><br><p>'Oh, Adam Vinter, I have to take you away from humans and your Operator too, but that's not the priority. Otherwise, you could destroy the world, completely... It's far worse than our, unfortunate situation.'</p><br><p>Toward the end of the Crimson Monarch's musings, Adam appeared in front of him. His wing was wide open, his rings glowing with red energy, and Lone Blaze was wielding his needle.</p><br><p>"The Crimson Monarch, it's time to call it a day."</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam's fists came down on the majestic monster. He reacted immediately, stopping Adam's hits, his gauntlets were strong enough for that, and in terms of speed, he was not inferior.</p><br><br><p>A red-hot needle pierced the Crimson Monarch's shoulder, then in a lightning-fast sweep split his chest.</p><br><p>Before the Crimson Monarch could react, Adam grabbed him by the collar, his veins filling his arms in a tight grip.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's eyes went wide for a moment, regeneration was actively healing his wounds, but that was not Adam's goal.</p><br><p>Adam's gaze grew darker as he flapped his wing, flying high up.</p><br><p>"I already told you that I'm going to throw you to the ground, you arrogant bastard!"</p><br><p>They glared at each other, the Crimson Monarch trying to loosen Adam's grip, yet Adam's hands would rather tear off than his fingers unclench. This was his best opportunity, he couldn't fail.</p><br><p>Disappearing behind a layer of dark clouds, for a split second Adam soared through the air. He made enough mistakes, that no one else could help him.</p><br><p>Streams of energy traveled down the Crimson Monarch's gauntlets, he was going to destroy Adam's arms, for he would not die from it.</p><br><p>At the last moment, gritting his teeth, Adam lifted the Crimson Monarch above him before throwing the Crimson Monarch down with all his might.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch expected Adam to do this, so he didn't worry. He started flapping his wing vigorously, aiming his arms at Adam, ready to fire a shot of scarlet lightning.</p><br><p>But, instead of dodging, Adam's wing came into motion throwing him into the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>In the blink of an eye, the distance between them shortened so much that in the event of a direct hit, the blast would have killed them both.</p><br><p>Adam's risk was justified.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's eyes went wide, he prepared to block Adam's attack, soon a flaming needle reflected in his eyes.</p><br><br><p>The sharp blade slashed into The Crimson Monarch's gauntlets, sparks flew off to the side, the needle was unable to pierce his armor.</p><br><p>The truth was that it was a distraction.</p><br><p>With the next breath, Adam's fist full force from his Nexus, plunged into the Crimson Monarch's belly.</p><br><p>Sure, if he attacked to the head, it would have dealt the Crimson Monarch's damage much more seriously, but that wasn't Adam's goal.</p><br><br><p>A ring of wind spread around with a thud. The shockwave threw the Crimson Monarch straight down like a cannonball.</p><br><p>Despite the intense pain and damaged organs, the Crimson Monarch immediately tried to regain his balance.</p><br><br><p>His lone wing flapped violently, wanting to take control of the wind currents. Perhaps, if he had two powerful wings he would have succeeded, but... in his situation, the attempts were hopeless.</p><br><p>The momentum was too strong, the only thing that awaited the Crimson Monarch was a violent crash to the ground.</p><br><p>The monsters watching the fight from the surface quickly scurried away. No one knew what would happen next.</p><br><p>With a pillar of black sand mixed with snow, the Crimson Monarch crashed into the ground.</p><br><p>Before he could get up, a fiery burst of flame rained down on him in his wake, Adam wasn't about to slow down. This was his opportunity to seize the advantage.</p><br><p>Then, one Phantom in the fortress jerked.</p><br><p>"They're on the ground..." Katrin muttered in disbelief, "Right, he did it."</p><br><p>Viron and Gnash glanced over. They couldn't help Adam, at least not as long as the Crimson Monarch had at least a tenth of his strength, but Katrin had that opportunity.</p><br><p>"Go ahead... You've been waiting for this moment." Viron nodded slightly, going to watch the fight, he achieved his victory already.</p><br><p>His eyes grew deeper, and coldness and curiosity mixed into an unknown emotion.</p><br><p>"Not all of us get a second chance, but you get a third one. Take full advantage of it."</p><br><br><p>Gnash walked over to her and swung her staff, gravity plates, purple stones full of energy ended up on her wrists and ankles.</p><br><p>Seriousness with hope filled her rare eyes.</p><br><p>"I'm not a support, but I can help with some things thanks to my plentiful abilities. You'll be faster and stronger, the recoil weaker, but only as long as my gravity works on you."</p><br><p>Glancing at them, Katrin nodded firmly, pressing her fist to her chest.</p><br><p>"Thank you, both of you. Unlike me, you have won your battles. I'll do my best."</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Katrin rushed forward, jumping off the north tower to head into the most dangerous fight of her life.</p>
