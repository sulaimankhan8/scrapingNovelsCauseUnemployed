            <br><p>Adam's eyes slowly clouded over, the blood was rapidly leaving his body, and he could feel himself weakening, completely bewildered and lost.</p><br><p>However, as soon as Zera's lips came into motion, emitting a low whisper, everything changed.</p><br><p>The crimson blade of the scythe that had pierced their bodies shuddered, turning into blood and heading towards Adam, to his chest.</p><br><p>The blood turned into a scarlet cross from which many red threads emanated, they covered Adam's body and stuck into the places where he was wounded.</p><br><p>Adam immediately felt better, power spread through his body as if he got a second breath.</p><br><p>"Good luck... I've bet everything on you, and I'm sure you won't fail, but... you have to remember. You only have fifteen minutes." Zera muttered before collapsing.</p><br><p>Adam caught her gently with both hands, for his fracture was no longer a thing. The scarlet cross and red threads worked like an exoskeleton, they would maintain his condition and give immense strength until the energy ran out.</p><br><p>"Thank you. Now I not only understand you better but also what some of us are fighting for..." Adam muttered with a deep gaze.</p><br><p>He jumped aside, leaving Zera far away so that she would be safe, because soon he would have to fight a very dangerous opponent.</p><br><p>Adam didn't notice it, but as he stepped back, Zera opened her eyes slightly. She didn't have a drop of energy left, she was exhausted, but she was still conscious. Even if she had used all her will, she wouldn't have been able to move a finger.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The ground shook, and soon a massive shadow appeared in the distance.</p><br><p>Adam stood confidently on his feet, waiting for the monster that was last in the cluster of anomalies.</p><br><p>"ROOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAARRRR!!!!"</p><br><p>There was a furious roar as the huge silhouette leaped forward, smashing through the iron building, effortlessly destroying everything in its path.</p><br><p>"Oh... You must be pretty damn strong, aren't you?" Adam muttered, feeling the monster's eerie aura that was definitely above the blue threat level.</p><br><p>Adam looked at the Blizzard Harbinger, Purple Threat Level, and White Book.</p><br><p>Monsters of such power shouldn't be in the east of the Rusty Ruins, however, the anomaly cluster was adjusting the general rules. Normally, only in the north or center could someone so dangerous appear, but the present could not be changed.</p><br><p>Blizzard Harbinger possessed a long body with four legs like a beast from the myths. Hundreds of ice scales were his defense, impregnable, able to repel any attack. Sharp claws leaving long streaks on the ground spread the threat.</p><br><p>A thick, broad tail with a massive ice crystal like a hammer could bring down the enemy of the Blizzard Harbinger to turn it into nothing.</p><br><p>From the monster's powerful jaws came curved fangs, created not to cut, but to tear flesh to shreds.</p><br><p>Blizzard Harbinger turned its head with two long horns, staring intently at Adam as if trying to figure out if he was his opponent.</p><br><p>"Come on! I'm ready to fight you!" Adam exclaimed as he swung his hand, summoning the needle.</p><br><p>The Blizzard Harbinger bared its fangs, accepting Adam's challenge and heading forward, the ice breaking beneath the massive monster.</p><br><p>Adam was completely focused, watching Blizzard Harbinger's every move.</p><br><p>Then, Blizzard Harbinger's claws dug into the ground, and eyes wide open, he was ready to attack, and Adam prepared for it.</p><br><p>However, Adam soon realized that there was no intimidation in the monster's gaze, only desperation and pure pain.</p><br><p>"ROOOOAAAAAARRRRRRR!!!"</p><br><p>Blizzard Harbinger roared as something dragged Blizzard Harbinger backwards.</p><br><p>Yes, that's exactly what happened, the monster that must have weighed more than a few tons was being dragged backwards as if Blizzard Harbinger was not a predator but someone's next victim.</p><br><p>Then, the monster's thick tail flew off to the side, sliced off at a perfect angle as if it had been done by someone who had been wielding a sword for decades.</p><br><p>"No fucking way..." Adam muttered in disbelief as a gray flash swept through the entire Blizzard Harbinger.</p><br><p>Two sharp blades sliced apart Blizzard Harbinger's flesh, turning the monster's insides into a bloody mess.</p><br><p>In fact, it wasn't even a battle or a decent kill. Blizzard Harbinger was simply cut like a piece of meat, like a pig in the hands of a butcher, neither escaping nor resisting was impossible.</p><br><p>Blizzard Harbinger was still alive despite all the wounds, but he was bleeding out fast, and only a couple minutes remained before he would die from his wounds. The mysterious predator didn't bother to finish him off, after all, it wasn't Blizzard Harbinger who was its target.</p><br><p>"You... It's you..."</p><br><p>Adam shuddered, for, strangely enough, he had previously met the one who just slashed Blizzard Harbinger.</p><br><p>Dark drops of blood, like scarlet rain, fell on the majestic armor, only to head for two long swords, sharpened on both sides.</p><br><p>Through a slit in his helmet, amber lights could be seen - the eyes of the Steel Knight, who stared intently at Adam, waiting for him to acknowledge.</p><br><p>"I see... You didn't get the chance to fight me then, though you certainly wanted to, didn't you? You were able to wait, but your patience has come to an end." Adam said with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>He didn't know why, but seeing the Steel Knight again made him smile as if everything had fallen into place.</p><br><p>Blizzard Harbinger was not the 'final one' that Adam had been thinking about for some time. However, now all doubts were gone.</p><br><p>Their fight had not yet begun, but since Blizzard Harbinger was dying, soon Mirage curse would be broken, and the members of the Scarlet River Squad would be free.</p><br><p>However, it would be later than Adam's fifteen minutes would come to an end, by which time - the outcome of their fight would already be settled.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>Without warning, the Steel Knight rushed forward, holding his swords tightly.</p><br><p>Adam was wary. He was more worried not about how strong the Steel Knight really was, but about the two swords. Previously, Adam hadn't fought such opponents since this was his second Crown Monster, though... it was more than most K1 Phantoms.</p><br><p>Silver threads covered his arm tightly, preparing for a clash.</p><br><p>Then, two swords rained down on Adam from top to bottom, leaving him only a second to react and defend himself.</p><br><p>The ground beneath him cracked, and his veins swelled with tightly clenched teeth.</p><br><p>'Holy shit! What kind of abnormal power is this!?'</p><br><p>In this case, it was important to realize that Adam was now much stronger than usual thanks to Zera's ability. At this moment, his body was at the Resonance level, roughly speaking, Adam was one step higher than in the common state.</p><br><p>'Despite all this... One attack is enough to suppress me!' Adam internally exclaimed, trying to throw back the Steel Knight who was pressing down on him with all his might.</p><br><p>Whoooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>The Steel Knight abruptly turned around, kicking Adam and knocking him dozens of meters aside.</p><br><p>After smashing his back through several ice crystals, Adam stopped in a pile of metal next to a building.</p><br><p>The Steel Knight was in no hurry, he stepped slowly, giving Adam time to realize the kind of situation he was in.</p><br><p>"No... At this rate, I won't be able to last even one minute..." Adam muttered, then his eyes went wide as he realized something.</p><br><p>Adam's gaze went to Blizzard Harbinger, who was going to die of bleeding in a few seconds.</p><br><p>Then, Adam rushed straight for Blizzard Harbinger.</p><br><p>If he could participate in the killing of the Blizzard Harbinger, if he could somehow connect his Evolution Tree to it, he could absorb some of the genes! The three of them were roughly equal in strength, so it wouldn't break any rules!</p><br><p>It wouldn't be enough to unlock the Second Trait of his Nexus, but... only one gene was enough for the Third Trait of his artifact.</p><br><p>'Other than that, I need three more Zero Rarity Artefacts, but that shouldn't be a problem!' Adam inwardly exclaimed, knowing that the Harvesters had enough artifacts. He just needed to get to the trucks and get them.</p><br><br><p>Adam threw the needle, plunging it straight into Blizzard Harbinger's head, finally killing the monster just moments before Blizzard Harbinger would die its death.</p><br><p>'Nice! All that's left is...!'</p><br><p>The iron fist came crashing down into Adam's face, immediately breaking his nose and tossing him aside again.</p><br><p>However, it was as if Adam had been expecting this as he abruptly pulled the thread, dragging himself towards the Blizzard Harbinger and whizzing past the Steel Knight.</p><br><p>'When I upgrade my artifact, you're finished!'</p><br><p>Adam's eyes flashed as electric sparks flew between them.</p>
