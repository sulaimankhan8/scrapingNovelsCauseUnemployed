            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1109: View from Above (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Adam fought monsters and other Phantoms countless times. He also had clashes with humans, both before and after he became a Phantom. One notable example was Max, who worked for the Dark Order, one of the three major forces in the Citadel.</p><br><p>However, Max was more of an exception than a real rival, as it all happened during training.</p><br><p>But… even against Max in the simulation, Adam didn’t feel as shocked as he did when Douglas’s palm slammed into his chest.</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam got up, still not believing what had happened.</p><br><p>Then, he turned his gaze to Douglas, who was standing next to Silvana with a broad smile.</p><br><p>“His aura… What is it?”</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana saw the same scene.</p><br><p>White, dense energy, pure as the beginning of the world, emanated from Douglas’s strong frame. There was no hint of anything else in Douglas’s energy, nor was there any trace of the opposite element—darkness—which monsters and phantoms like Adam possessed.</p><br><br><p>Adam slowly moved forward, with each step the pain in his chest becoming less significant and his curiosity growing.</p><br><p>“So, at the Twilight Palace, I wasn’t imagining things, right?”</p><br><p>His gaze swept over Douglas.</p><br><p>“Andreas, you… and maybe there are others. You’re not ordinary people, are you? Not monsters, but not Phantoms either, and yet…” Adam gulped. “You possess such great power. How the hell is that possible?”</p><br><p>“Well.” Douglas waved his hand. “That’s one of the reasons I brought you here. I’ll tell you everything, but… Don’t you want to know how strong I am before that? I’m sure you and Silvana will be tormented by this question for a long time if you back out now.”</p><br><br><p>Adam’s curiosity was as great as Silvana’s.</p><br><p>Douglas had played a rather important role in both their lives, even though he only appeared at the right moments.</p><br><p>Efficiency and precision — what else could be expected from a high-ranking military officer?</p><br><p>Was he even a military officer?</p><br><p>Adam brushed the dust off his shoulder, and his expression completely changed.</p><br><p>“What can I use? I mean, I don’t want to hurt you or damage the queen’s land. Considering how important it is… considering what I know now. Every stone here is a treasure, right?”</p><br><p>“Hahaha!” Douglas laughed out loud. “Yeah, it’s an important place, but… Adam.”</p><br><p>Suddenly, Douglas’s voice became darker as a shadow hid his menacing figure.</p><br><p>“Do you really think you can damage the queen’s land just because you’ve become a K4-Phantom? I’m sure Wilfred told you that you’re back at the bottom of the food chain!”</p><br><p>“Yeah, I know that.” Adam nodded weakly. “One day you’re the strongest among the weakest, and the next you’re the weakest among the strongest. Like everything else I’ve heard, that’s not the best news.”</p><br><p>Douglas shrugged as his frame trembled.</p><br><p>In the shadows, Douglas found himself to Adam’s right as his large fist moved straight toward Adam’s face.</p><br><p>Adam reacted equally. He ducked as Douglas’s fist swept over his shoulder.</p><br><p>Then, Adam’s eyes flashed as his fist, full of energy, slammed into Douglas’s chest.</p><br><br><p>Douglas’s eyebrow twitched as his aura trembled. A slight shockwave receded as a ring of air caused the grass around them to tremble.</p><br><p>“Not bad, for a beginner!” Douglas exclaimed, grabbing Adam by the wrist.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br><br><br><p>Douglas threw him aside and ran after him to jump higher than Adam while they were both still in the air.</p><br><p>Adam could use his abilities, but he didn’t want to.</p><br><p>It was pride, the one thing that could get him into trouble.</p><br><p>“Until he proves that he’s dangerous, I’m not going to do it.”</p><br><p>Adam thought, looking at Douglas, who had clenched his hands into a single fist.</p><br><p>“Has he finally decided to show his strength because I became a K4-Phantom and now have access to most of the secrets, or… because if I become even stronger, he won’t be able to surprise me with his strength?”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, both of Adam’s assumptions were correct to some extent.</p><br><br><p>Douglas’s blow hit the ground as a pillar of dust rose.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, two shadows flew out as Adam and Douglas clashed in hand-to-hand combat.</p><br><p>Earlier, it had been difficult for Silvana to follow Adam’s movements and those of his opponent because they were too fast, but now everything was different.</p><br><p>‘How? They move so smoothly…’ Silvana thought.</p><br><p>She saw every movement, no trick, blow, or step to the side went unnoticed by her.</p><br><p>Not only Adam’s but Douglas’s attacks as well.</p><br><p>She didn’t need to use the shared vision; now her strength was enough.</p><br><p>Unconsciously, a smile appeared on her face.</p><br><br><p>For almost a minute, Adam and Douglas exchanged a barrage of countless blows. Most of the punches were blocked or dodged, but from time to time they hit their target.</p><br><p>It seemed that Adam and Douglas’s bodies had the same strength, even though Adam was a K4-Phantom and Douglas was… who was he?</p><br><p>“Alright, old man, it’s time to end this! You’ve given me a reason to take revenge for your deception!” Adam frowned as energy covered his legs in a white whirlwind.</p><br><p>He found himself behind Douglas, ready to end it all with one precise blow to the neck.</p><br><p>But before Adam could attack Douglas’s right arm turned into a shadow, grabbing his ankle tightly.</p><br><br><p>Douglas slammed Adam to the ground like a puppet, causing the stone to crack.</p><br><p>But… Douglas didn’t move anymore. He couldn’t.</p><br><p>Douglas’s eyebrow twitched as his eyes dropped lower.</p><br><p>Adam’s palm was like a sharp blade right at his throat. If Adam had wanted to, Douglas would already have choked on his blood.</p><br><p>“Well, well…” Douglas gulped. “Looks like you won, right?”</p><br><p>He held out his hand to Adam to help him up.</p><br><p>“Yeah, it looks that way. Although…” Adam narrowed his eyes, staring intently at Douglas as if he were hiding something. “You didn’t… Never mind.”</p><br><p>Silvana ran up to them, concerned.</p><br><p>“Is everything okay?”</p><br><p>They both nodded as Douglas took a deep breath.</p><br><p>“Alright, that was a good warm-up. Now it’s time for you to find out who I am and the few other people like me.”</p>
