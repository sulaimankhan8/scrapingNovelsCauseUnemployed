            <br><br><p>Plague Reaper slowly walked forward, his footsteps echoing around, instilling fear and terror in anyone who wasn't prepared for a deadly battle with the strongest Purple Threat monster.</p><br><p>Now, there were no more obstacles left. All the monsters were dead, those monsters that remained outside of the Fume Cathedral could not enter and were greatly frightened by the eerie aura that emanated from this gothic building.</p><br><p>Katrin took one last glance at Scarlet Pyromancer and shook her head.</p><br><p>'No, I can't demand them to help me kill Scarlet Pyromancer right now, that's impossible. First, we have to deal with him.' Katrin pondered while staring intently at the Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>The mere posture of the Plague Reaper was enough to show how confident he was in his powers, but... unlike Oskar, Erla, and Lero who were frightened and consumed by his influence, Katrin felt no fear.</p><br><p>She realized that Plague Reaper was an unusual monster, moreover, it was a Crown Type, which showed its power in battles, especially in closed areas.</p><br><p>'Fine, although these three are weaker than us, but me, Osana and Adam are more than strong enough to withstand the competition. Adam defeated Essence Thunder Demon, Top-2, so... fighting Top-1 with the supports shouldn't be too difficult, right?'</p><br><p>Katrin pondered while looking at Adam and Osana from time to time.</p><br><p>'And... Osana, that bitch wasn't as easy as the others. I hate to admit it, but as a support, she's definitely much better than me. Moreover, from her snake-like gaze, it's clear that she's hiding something. She's got a trump card.'</p><br><p>Adam stepped forward, not at all afraid that Plague Reaper would resort to dirty tricks. Lero and Erla glanced anxiously at Fume Armors, thinking that they would soon attack them from behind.</p><br><p>However... until Plague Reaper gave the order, Fume Armors would continue to stand still in the remote parts of the Fume Cathedral, blending in with the shadows.</p><br><p>Furthermore, even if Plague Reaper is in real danger, the Fume Armors will not defend him unless Plague Reaper gives the order.</p><br><p>Lero, Erla, and the others didn't know this, but Adam realized that there was no way Plague Reaper would use Fume Armors in their battle.</p><br><p>Adam smirked, pointing his needle at Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>"Getting those monsters to attack me and my mates would be a real humiliation for a great warrior like you, wouldn't it?" Adam smirked, understanding the nature of the Crown Type monsters.</p><br><p>Crown Types went through many battles to come to their peak form and become creatures of a special group.</p><br><p>Maybe not immediately, but gradually they understood what a decent fight meant and how they could get the most out of it to become even stronger.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper didn't answer anything, he just continued walking forward, staring intently at Adam as if he were his only opponent. It seemed that Plague Reaper saw Adam as the only real threat, and didn't care about the others.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper's foot touched the ground and his silhouette shuddered, disappearing after a second and leaving behind only a puff of black mist.</p><br><br><p>Lero's eyes went wide as a shadow fell upon him from the towering figure before him, whose calm gaze looked at him as nothing more than an insect that stirred beneath his feet.</p><br><p>Before Lero could react, the Plague Reaper's fist was headed for his face, bringing with it currents of wind and explosive power capable of blowing his skull to pieces.</p><br><br><p>Another silhouette appeared in front of Lero, with electric shocks running through its body and a red magic circle shining brightly on its chest, powering the roots that coiled around its body.</p><br><p>With a hurried glance, Adam placed his palm under the Plague Reaper's strike, pressing his hand against his stomach to minimize the power of the momentum.</p><br><br><p>The shockwave traveled through Adam's body, causing every muscle in his body to contract and feel the concentrated physical power Plague Reaper possessed.</p><br><p>'Shit... Even with all the reinforcements and the fact that I had enough time to prepare a block, I could barely stand on my feet.' Adam internally muttered before lowering his gaze.</p><br><p>There were two black lines on the stone floor, rather short, only a few centimeters long, but it meant that Plague Reaper could move Adam that far with his punch.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper lifted his chin, as his eyes grew a little wider.</p><br><p>'Adam, do it now...' Silvana said quickly.</p><br><p>Adam had no reason to doubt Silvana's words, so as soon as she finished speaking, Adam abruptly grabbed Lero and jumped aside as if he was trying to keep him from something.</p><br><p>But... Plague Reaper despite all his deadliness wasn't attacking right now. Then who was Adam saving Lero from?</p><br><br><p>A white projectile flew from the long muzzle of the sniper rifle, coming at high speed toward Plague Reaper, whose gaze was now fixed on Adam.</p><br><p>Erla was burning Plague Reaper with her stare. She was afraid to fight such a dangerous monster, but that didn't mean she was going to stand idly by.</p><br><p>Unlike Plague Reaper who was alone, they worked in teams and had Operators with whom they could quickly come up with plans of action and turn them into life.</p><br><p>A second ago, Plague Reaper didn't even realize that Erla was up to something, he was going to continue attacking Adam, but now a powerful projectile was heading towards him, it seemed impossible to dodge.</p><br><br><p>Sweeping through the streams of wind like an extremely sharp blade, Plague Reaper's palm came into motion. A black mist covered his white bandaged hand before he placed his palm under the blow.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Plague Reaper jerked his arm sharply, guiding the projectile over his palm and forcing it to change its trajectory.</p><br><p>Some of the bandages on his palm tore, revealing his pale skin where a scratch remained, but... the threat had passed.</p><br><p>Adam's and everyone else's eyes went wide, staring at Plague Reaper in disbelief as if he had done something impossible.</p><br><p>'Fuck... What was that?!' Katrin inwardly exclaimed, gritting her teeth, 'That projectile should have at least ripped his face apart, but instead, he just threw it away with his palm? He just reflected Erla's ability?!'</p><br><p>At the same moment, a white projectile with a disrupted trajectory reached the corner of the Fume Cathedral.</p><br><p>The shockwave caused torrents of wind to blow away everyone in its path before a blast of white flames shook the entire Fume Cathedral. Waves of fire spread around, quickly escaping through the wide hole created by the explosion.</p><br><br><p>A few stone debris fell down, shattering the cold floor into splinters and letting the moonlight seep inside.</p><br><br><p>Oskar's enthusiastic voice shattered the fleeting silence, appearing next to Plague Reaper and sheathing his sword that was already endowed with light energy.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Several roots with sharp spikes grew out of the ground, completely immobilizing Plague Reaper, only for a moment, but it seemed to be enough.</p><br><p>"Die!" Oskar angrily exclaimed, tightly clutching the hilt of his sword that was already close to Plague Reaper's neck.</p><br><p>Then... Plague Reaper's coat which looked like plain old clothes began to shake like a living creature.</p>
