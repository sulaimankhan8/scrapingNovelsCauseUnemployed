            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1205: Power of the storm (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Clash! Clash! Clash!</p><br><p>About a minute ago, Adam and Bathild made it to the surface. For both of them, it was a suitable battlefield, although Adam benefited the most from the change in area.</p><br><p>He didn’t have to watch the passages and worry that Bathild might use the nearest wall to bounce off it and end up behind him.</p><br><p>All he had to do was keep attacking while his rods gradually heated up.</p><br><p>Sure, when he was facing only one opponent, he couldn’t use all the features of this ability, but that didn’t mean he would lose.</p><br><p>Bathild always won and gained an advantage over others thanks to her speed. To her horror, she discovered that Adam was not slower. They were fighting on equal terms.</p><br><p>“Shit, this is harder than I thought…!” Bathild exclaimed inwardly as she blocked another of Adam’s lunges.</p><br><br><p>Then, Adam clenched the two rods tightly, bringing them down on Bathild from above. She had no choice but to put her halberd in the line of fire.</p><br><p>A lone, dark shard flew off the hilt as Bathild’s eyes followed it. Her pupils narrowed in disbelief, unable to believe that her weapon had suffered such serious damage.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam’s rods weren’t indestructible either, but it was a skill. If Adam had enough energy, he could create new rods or needles at any moment. It wasn’t a big deal for him.</p><br><p>Usually, no matter how fierce the battle was, none of the fighters lost their weapons. It happened too rarely to be a case.</p><br><p>At the Second Circle level, it was practically impossible.</p><br><p>Each monster, or more precisely, each Lord, had their own special weapon — the Arc. As an Elder, Bathild had nothing like it, but she still longed for it.</p><br><p>Even if several Elders were fighting her and all their attacks were aimed at her halberd, her weapon would only get a few cracks at most.</p><br><p>At that moment, Bathild realized that if things continued at this pace, Adam would simply destroy her halberd.</p><br><p>‘Fuck! It’s all because of his energy, right?’ Bathild exclaimed internally as she swung her halberd, throwing Adam aside.</p><br><p>Adam did a somersault and landed on the ground.</p><br><p>Hot steam emanated from his rods as the dark threads around them turned red, red-hot and ready for battle.</p><br><p>“What are you going to do now? It seems you have nothing left that could hurt me, right?” Adam asked, but his voice was mocking Bathild’s attempts.</p><br><p>Strange as it may seem, he saw her as much less of a threat than the Essence Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>It wasn’t just because Adam didn’t have much experience at that point.</p><br><p>He didn’t feel that Bathild could kill him.</p><br><p>When he fought against the Crimson Monarch and Arnoth, he knew that every mistake could be his last.</p><br><p>Now… He saw before him a monster that was stronger than the others, but not more dangerous.</p><br><p>“Very soon, I will destroy your halberd, Bathild. I’m afraid you won’t be able to do anything to me with your claws, and your tail… I’ll cut it off at the next opportunity.”</p><br><p>It didn’t sound like a threat. Adam’s voice was as if he were stating obvious facts, whether Bathild wanted to hear them or not.</p><br><br><p>Bathild said nothing, but as soon as Adam took a step forward, she raised her halberd and grabbed the hilt with both hands, close to the edges.</p><br><p>“Hey, you absorbed the Twilight Crystal at the K3 Level, didn’t you?” Bathild asked, something in her had changed.</p><br><p>This alarmed Adam, but he couldn’t understand what had happened.</p><br><p>“Yes. That’s why you’re hunting me, isn’t it? I know that now I’m a real walking treasure for every monster. However, for starters, someone like you needs to defeat me, and that turned out to be not as easy as you thought. Am I right?”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Bathild nodded.</p><br><p>“Sure. However, I just want to get my title. Your energy isn’t my goal, but… this will be my chance to survive this battle!”</p><br><p>It was unclear what Bathild meant by her last words, but Adam didn’t have time to think about it.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Bathild snapped her halberd in two, throwing the two pieces away like useless trash.</p><br><p>She didn’t want to wait for her weapon to break at the worst possible moment. That could lead to her defeat.</p><br><p>“Adam Vinter, I can see in your eyes that you think I made a mistake bringing you to the surface, but this is the best battlefield for me!”</p><br><p>Tremble! Tremble! Tremble!</p><br><p>The rumble of thunder reminded them of its presence. While they were deep underground at the Kirani Colony, the storm intensified, thickening the lightning.</p><br><p>This could have been a threat to weaker monsters here on the borders of the Dead Lands, where a powerful thunder strike could reduce even the Black Threat Monster to ash, but that was not true for Bathild.</p><br><p>She had brought the storm from her lands here and intended to use it to defeat one of the most famous young Phantoms of this century.</p><br><p>With a bright flash, the thunderbolt struck Bathild directly. Her horns worked like a lightning rod, drawing the dangerous power toward her.</p><br><p>She was unharmed, on the contrary, the electrical discharges ran through her body, filling her with energy.</p><br><p>Bathild leaned forward, her claws glistening.</p><br><p>“I’m ready to admit it, Adam. I probably couldn’t defeat you in a simple arena or even in the caves, but you can’t handle me when I have thunder on my side!”</p><br><p>As before, Adam didn’t take her threats seriously.</p><br><p>That was a big mistake.</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could even realize what was happening, Bathild appeared to his right. A moment ago, she had been ten meters ahead of him, but now her fist was moving straight toward him.</p><br><p>The lava lakes ahead and the dark earth turned upside down, as did the huge volcano.</p><br><p>But nothing happened to the earth. It remained in its place, motionless. It was Adam’s body that bent from Bathild’s fist hitting him straight in the face.</p><br><p>In a split second, the impact passed through his body, throwing him dozens of meters to the side.</p><br><p>And Bathild was ready to follow him and tear him to pieces while she still had the power of the storm.</p>
