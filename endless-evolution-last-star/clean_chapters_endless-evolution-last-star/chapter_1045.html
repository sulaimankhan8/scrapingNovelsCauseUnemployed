            <h4>Chapter 1045: Key Spark (Part 2)</h4><br><br><p>Adam approached Rosana, who stared at him with great frown. Her face was pale, she spent a lot of energy trying to inflict at least one serious wound on Adam, yet it didn’t happen.
</p><br><p>’Shit, Arnoth...? Who the fuck is he talking about?’ Rosana gritted her teeth, climbing out of the ruined tree. ’Whatever, even if he seems too strong, he has to have a weak spot, doesn’t he?’
</p><br><p>With a slight nod, Rosana decided to change tactics. Speed and regeneration didn’t work against Adam, meaning she needed strength and a suitable weapon.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>All the blood and jaws in one stream headed towards Rosana’s right hand, taking the form of a great sword of constantly flowing blood and snapping jaws arranged along the blade.
</p><br><p>Adam lifted his chin, unimpressed.
</p><br><p>"You know, when I first saw a regenerative monster, I thought it was cool. I mean, you can’t lose if you can heal any wound in a moment, right?
</p><br><p>"But, that turned out to be stupid. You have nothing but regeneration. Those jaws look intimidating, you control them pretty well, but... It’s not enough."
</p><br><p>There was no reply, Rosana only gritted her teeth.
</p><br><p>She understood this much better than Adam did.
</p><br><p>’I just needed some time... Stupid Phantom! That human doesn’t even realize what monsters like me at the peak of my power can do!’
</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.
</p><br><p>On the other side of the lake, Risha, Heret, and Vorx gradually managed their task. Defeating the two Blood Crushers and the pack of the Voracious Beasts was not easy, but the longer they fought, the stronger they became.
</p><br><p>Heret was especially affected by this.
</p><br><p>The Voracious Beast, with its jaw wide open, appeared behind Heret, who was breathing heavily. Blood was dripping from the wound in his side from the Blood Crusher’s recent strike.
</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, Heret turned around, greeting the Voracious Beast with an excited expression. Green flames flashed before his eyes as his frame shook.
</p><br><br><p>Heret found himself on the other side, leaving behind the blasted Voracious Beast. The flames were actively burning away parts of the beast, and for some reason, it could not recover quickly.
</p><br><p>Wearing a sly grin, Heret clenched his jaws, ripping the Voracious Beast’s heart into pieces and swallowing quickly.
</p><br><p>Sure enough, the heart of the regenerative monster tried to attack Heret from within, but that was no problem for him.
</p><br><p>His flames could burn through far faster than the Voracious Beasts regenerated.
</p><br><br><p>Heret licked his lips, looking at the two badly wounded Blood Crushers.
</p><br><p>’Vorx turned out to be right. I was actually missing that. There’s nothing wrong with being a leader and making plans, but... first and foremost, I’m a monster!’
</p><br><br><p>Risha stepped forward, cutting off the Blood Crusher’s arm as before she swept Heret, who, like a wild beast, leapt at the great monster, leaving jagged wounds. After each of his leaps, a stream of blood was left flooding the ground.
</p><br><p>"Damn!" Risha exclaimed with eyes wide with amazement. "He looks completely different from how he did in training! If he fought like this before, he could have beaten Kreyna!"
</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.
</p><br><p>Their pace was actively increasing while the regenerative monsters were running out of energy. Because of the nature of their battle, Heret and Vorx could easily restore their energy by killing another Voracious Beast.
</p><br><p>In theory, Risha could have done the same, because even Phantoms could absorb the energy of the regenerative monsters, but she never did. It was too risky.
</p><br><p>Realizing that their imminent victory was inevitable, Risha glanced ahead, at Adam who was approaching trembling from fear, Rosana.
</p><br><p>Adam stopped, tilting his head. "What? You won’t even try to attack me?"
</p><br><p>Rosana gulped, clutching her bloody sword tightly.
</p><br><p>"You are my enemy... You should be the one to attack. Do it first if you dare!"
</p><br><p>And... Adam remained where he was.
</p><br><br><p>Something was wrong.
</p><br><p>Could Rosana win? No. Adam was as sure of that as she was. However, what made him suspicious was that he didn’t see any dread of death in her eyes.
</p><br><p>All she was afraid of was losing again.
</p><br><p>"What are you doing here?" he asked, normally. "You don’t seem to belong here. You’re alone and very different from the other monsters."
</p><br><p>Before Rosana could somehow reply, Adam leaned forward as his low voice broke out:
</p><br><p>"Tell me - did you come from the Dark Shore?"
</p><br><p>Rosana’s eyes went wide.
</p><br><p>It was her mistake that Adam managed to guess that. It was largely due to her reaction to Adam’s past words about the New Wave monsters.
</p><br><p>"What if I did?" Rosana frowned. "This place is too far away for you to worry about. Instead of asking me questions, you’d better start fighting!"
</p><br><p>With a fiery shout, she swung her sword, covering the ground in dark blood.
</p><br><p>"Alright. I would do it anyway."
</p><br><p>A second needle appeared in Adam’s hand as he appeared in front of Rosana - too fast for her to put up a defense.
</p><br><p>Then, he ended up behind her, tearing her apart with a small path. Rosana didn’t see this power, so she tried to recover quickly, but Adam kept attacking again and again.
</p><br><p>Very quickly, Rosana’s energy headed for the bottom. She realized that she wouldn’t last even half a minute at this rate, and she would run out of energy.
</p><br><p>’Fuck! I’ll have to do it!’ Rosana exclaimed as she tore out her left eye.
</p><br><p>Adam bounced to the side. He didn’t realize what she was doing.
</p><br><p>A small, strange orb with carved runes fell out of her empty eye socket. Adam lunged forward in an attempt to stop her, but it was too late. Rosana destroyed the orb.
</p><br><p>With a bright light, the air behind her shook as a multitude of bloody hands dragged her into an unknown dimension.
</p><br><p>Instead of Rosana, what remained was a red spark that quickly flew into Adam’s chest - completing the second condition for the creation of the final key.
</p><br><p>A bemused but happy grin covered Adam’s face until he noticed something strange.
</p><br><p>A dark mist was passing at his feet and hands, unfamiliar and frightening.
</p><br><p>He turned around sharply only to see a torn-apart space releasing the mist.
</p><br><p>Then, the mist engulfed him, quickly disappearing like a black flash.</p>
