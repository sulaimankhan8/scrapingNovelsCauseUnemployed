            <br><p>Ivar and Osmer were the strongest monsters at the Sacrificial Waterfalls, even though they were only Elders. It was a very high rank, they were comparable to Valdris at the Soaring Chain Islands, but it wasn't enough to own a large territory at the Dark Shore.</p><br><p>The reason was that the Sacrificial Waterfalls had a Lord like almost any region at the Dark Shore, but Ivar and Osmer's situation was unusual.</p><br><p>While they and their apprentices reported directly to the Befallen Crown, their Lord remained inactive most of the time and did not participate in their lives. The Lord of the Sacrificial Waterfalls was more like a landlord than a ruler.</p><br><p>Gladius killed all the monsters, but it didn't bother the Lord of the Sacrificial Waterfalls in any way.</p><br><p>But... What if Gladius wanted to take over the land?</p><br><p>It was rare, but as the Second Rank Phantom, especially of his level, he had that option.</p><br><p>Well, that could not be allowed to happen. There was an urgent need for intervention.</p><br><p>What about Osmer, Rosana, Ivar, and the others who died?</p><br><p>It wasn't that important. There would always be new regenerative monsters that would want to fill the Sacrificial Waterfalls, agreeing to terms just to reap the benefits of this place.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The surface of the river trembled, drawing Gladius's attention.</p><br><p>A pillar of blood rushed upwards, dark streams swirling in an active vortex, slowly revealing someone's silhouette.</p><br><p>Gladius's eyes went wide for a moment as the corners of his lips curved upward.</p><br><br><p>A small foot touched the cold ground as a red cloth dangled above the ankle.</p><br><p>A girl of medium height with pale skin and very long fangs protruding slightly from her mouth directed her gaze at Gladius. Her scarlet hair swept down in waves just below her bare shoulders, while her dress covered her lean frame.</p><br><p>Her eyes were large and colorful like blood rubies, with round, human pupils.</p><br><p>"How strange..." the girl muttered, running her gaze over Gladius. "Such a strong Phantom, yet we don't know each other. What's your name?"</p><br><p>Gladius blinked a few times. He was surprised at the girl's calm reaction.</p><br><p>She could easily see his real power, his aura, even though he was hiding it. Regardless, no new emotion appeared on her face. It seemed that even Gladius's true power could not make her tremble in fear.</p><br><p>Even among the Lords, that was rare.</p><br><p>Naturally, it only piqued Gladius's curiosity.</p><br><p>He put his palm to his chest and bowed theatrically.</p><br><p>"Gladius, my name is Gladius, young lady."</p><br><p>"Hmm? Oh, perhaps I should have been more precise. I want to hear your full name given to you by the Dark Shore," the girl uttered, Gladius's antics not working on her. "There's no way a Phantom of your power doesn't have a title. What's more... Apparently, you're a frequent visitor at the Dark Shore."</p><br><p>A predatory gleam ran across Gladius's eyes as he straightened.</p><br><p>"Hah, with all due respect, but what makes you think you have the right to hear my title? Just because you're a Lord and could see my aura doesn't mean anything."</p><br><p>Without saying anything, the girl raised her hand slightly.</p><br><p>At the same moment, out of the void formed a wide blade that headed towards Gladius, cleaving everything in its path.</p><br><p>With a whistling wind, Gladius easily dodged it.</p><br><p>"Decided to attack without warning? Well, that only proved my point. If you couldn't get me now, then we're not equal."</p><br><p>Once again, the girl silently pointed to the ground.</p><br><p>Gladius's eyes went wide, reflecting the few black hairs that fell from his bangs.</p><br><p>Xyrea licked her lips. 'She got you.'</p><br><p>"Damn, looks like it."</p><br><br><p>The girl stepped forward, raising her gaze upward due to the large difference in their height.</p><br><p>"In that case, I'll start first. My name is Menis, the Scarlet Bloom."</p><br><p>There was no response, only confusion.</p><br><p>"Hah, looks like you're a real hermit, right?" Gladius scratched the back of his head. "It's one thing that you don't know me, but... a strong Lord I've never heard of? That's very rare."</p><br><p>Menis tilted her head.</p><br><p>"If I surprise you, in that case, you'll introduce yourself properly."</p><br><p>'Come on!' Xyrea rolled her eyes. 'Some girl completely outplayed you! Accept defeat with honor!'</p><br><p>Gladius tried to maintain his sly expression, but Xyrea's words made his brow twitch.</p><br><br><p>With a light shudder, in Gladius's hand appeared a purple knife of energy as darkness engulfed his figure, leaving only his blue eyes visible.</p><br><p>"As you wish, Menis. My name is Gladius, Chef of the Devil. Are there any other wishes?"</p><br><p>"Yes." Menis nodded weakly as she glanced at the dozens of corpses off to the side. "Are you going to take over these lands?"</p><br><br><p>Menis's lips parted. "Do you plan to stay here for long?"</p><br><p>"No. If you hadn't shown up, I would have left by now."</p><br><br><p>Menis nodded deeply before asking her final question.</p><br><p>"Do you want to fight? Honestly, I'd rather go back to sleep. From what I've found out, we have no reason to."</p><br><p>Once again, a quick reply followed.</p><br><br><br><p>Menis turned around, about to disappear into the bloody river from which she came. The fate of the monsters that died at Gladius's hand did not concern her.</p><br><p>"Wait. I'd like to ask one question before you leave, as well." Gladius's low voice came from behind.</p><br><p>Like a robot, Menis turned around.</p><br><p>"I'm listening to you."</p><br><p>Gladius's eyes sparkled. "Let's go on a date. I know a few good places, but if you want, you can pick one yourself."</p><br><p>'Hey! What the fuck?!' Xyrea's scream echoed through his mind, but Gladius ignored her.</p><br><p>"No," Menis replied dryly. "I like obedient men. Things are easier with them."</p><br><p>"Oh, how straightforward. If need be, I can be very obedient," Gladius purred.</p><br><p>Menis's eyes narrowed. The first emotion on her face.</p><br><p>"That's unlikely. Taming you won't just be difficult, it's..." she stumped as she saw much more than was hidden behind Gladius's aura.</p><br><p>A multitude of demons with cruel smirks peered out of his darkness, their eyes narrowed into slits and someone chuckled predatorily, capable of sending shivers down almost any Lord's spine.</p><br>
