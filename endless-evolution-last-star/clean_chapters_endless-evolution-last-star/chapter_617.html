            <br><p>The reunion with their loved ones was a success, after a few minutes, the joy ceased to be so bright and uncontrollable and a quiet period ensued.</p><br><p>The Operators, Silvana and Arayna did not stand by and found out how their Phantoms were feeling, not forgetting to talk to the others from time to time.</p><br><p>But... Osana was not an Operator or family member to any of them. Could she have been the one? Well, it was a possibility, but it wasn't up to her to decide.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Osana stepped aside, hiding in the darkness of the far corner of the spacious hall. It didn't stop the others from watching them, but hearing their quiet voices was impossible.</p><br><p>Unwilling to wait any longer, Osana stared intently at Adam and her lips came into motion.</p><br><p>"What have you decided? You've had ten days to think about it."</p><br><p>A bitter smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"Ten days...? Hah, you know I've been asleep the whole time and woke up less than an hour ago, right?"</p><br><p>"Agh... Sure, of course, you know."</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Osana's hands, her tightly clenched fists trembling slightly.</p><br><p>"You're just nervous, but strangely enough I'm completely calm."</p><br><br><p>Leaning forward, Adam's palm fell against the wall next to Osana's face, his blue eyes staring intently into her pink ones.</p><br><p>"Didn't you want to be free and get rid of Nirosh Marzo? In the end, your fighter even exceeded your mission, didn't he?"</p><br><p>Osana gulped, feeling a shiver at his words. Adam was right - the death of the Nirosh Marzo was a dream come true she hadn't even counted on.</p><br><p>"In that case, what else do you want from me?"</p><br><p>Taking a step forward, Adam moved closer, the tips of his hair almost touching Osana's soft skin.</p><br><p>"Fine, I won't torture you anymore. I understand and I made my decision before the fight was even over."</p><br><p>Then, Adam's gaze became light and gentle, while not tolerating objections.</p><br><p>"Osana, I do not love you, nor do I have any romantic feelings for you. In my world, a man like that can't be in a relationship with someone let alone something as serious as a wedding. But... I consider you as a friend."</p><br><p>Adam glanced up with a faint smile on his face.</p><br><p>"You're cunning, calculating, a good manipulator, and a little crazy, but you're not a bad person and I need that kind of battle buddy."</p><br><p>Osana was silent for a while, her eyes wide open, occasionally sparkling. It was unclear from her reaction what she was thinking or how she was feeling. She could have been upset or angry, or maybe she didn't care?</p><br><p>Shaking her head, keeping her eyes closed, Osana grinned ironically:</p><br><p>"Hah, I don't remember asking for my characterization, but... I heard you. One fiancé is more than enough for me."</p><br><br><p>Moving Adam's hand out of her way, Osana stepped forward before glaring at him over her shoulder.</p><br><p>"In that case. I'll meet you next time in the Dead Lands. I'm not Osana De Rouzet for you but... just Osana, the random Phantom who saved you from the Top-1 Purple Threat monster."</p><br><p>Adam crossed his arms over his chest, lifting his chin confidently.</p><br><p>"Pfffft, I could do it without you. You did it on purpose, I was part of your plan even then."</p><br><p>No response followed, Osana only smiled weakly. They both realized that without Osana's help, Adam would definitely die and it didn't become her plan until later.</p><br><p>Then, Adam returned to the others, while Osana stood aside, not far from Silvana, for now, she didn't want to leave.</p><br><br><p>After a few minutes, a loud belly rumbling sounded simultaneously from the two spots, causing everyone to look at either Adam or Fromund.</p><br><p>Adam smiled awkwardly, scratching the back of his head.</p><br><p>"Well... We've been treated and given all the nutrients we need these ten days, but... It seems no one has fed us."</p><br><p>Arayna tilted her head, looking closely at Fromund, at his prominent cheekbones and clearly thinner face.</p><br><p>"Damn, you two need to eat! Right now!" Arayna said sternly, placing her hands at her sides.</p><br><p>Silvana joined her, she nodded deeply thoughtfully holding her chin.</p><br><p>"Yes, there is a dining room here. It's not a restaurant, but the food here is wholesome and healthy, that's what you need right now!"</p><br><p>Not wanting to agree, Fromund and Adam glanced over at each other. They were Phantoms, and in truth, their condition was almost unaffected by what food they ate and how much they ate. Their bodies were too strong and the energy was constantly purifying them.</p><br><p>But... when Adam wanted to say something, a tall, menacing silhouette with glowing demon-like eyes appeared behind them.</p><br><br><p>Leona's hands fell on their shoulders, squeezing tightly, making no favors for her son.</p><br><p>"Boys. I don't know what you're thinking, but your Operators are right. I'm sure you wouldn't turn down an offer to eat a healthy meal, would you?"</p><br><p>Adam and Fromund shuddered, goosebumps running down their bodies.</p><br><p>Elva, Tilda, and Liv who realized where everything was going, raised their heads looking at Fromund.</p><br><p>"Bro, is there going to be cheese pizza?"</p><br><p>"What about burgers? I want burgers!"</p><br><p>"No! I want something sweet! There will be cakes, right?"</p><br><p>This was the first time Elva, Tilda, and Liv were in the hospital. Sure, Fromund had been badly injured many times, but usually, he met them when he left the medical department, but this time was different.</p><br><p>Fromund was taken by surprise, he sighed heavily and shook his head:</p><br><p>"I'm afraid not. But... I think we can find something tasty even here."</p><br><br><p>Quite soon, wide, devious grins appeared on the two faces as they looked at the great buffet unfolded before them with food of all types!</p><br><p>"Hahaha! Fuck, there's more than just pizza in here! There's fucking tons of pizza here!" Fromund exclaimed happily.</p><br><p>Continue your journey with My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Adam shared his joy, pouring himself the biggest glass of soda, going to drink it all in a few gulps.</p><br><p>Elva, Tilda, and Liv, who thought this was how it should be, just looked around, not knowing what to choose, saliva dripping from their mouths.</p><br><p>At the same time, Silvana, Arayna, and Leona stood aside with stunned looks.</p><br><p>This was not the result they expected...</p>
