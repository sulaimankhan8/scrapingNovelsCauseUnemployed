            <h4>Chapter 1464: Casino</h4><br><p>Like anyone else, Adam knew what a casino was. He had seen countless times how characters in movies and TV shows would go to a casino and immediately hit the jackpot.
</p><br><p>But he was old enough to understand that it was all just a fairy tale. The chances of a person winning the jackpot were hundreds of times smaller than the chances of that person becoming a Phantom, which could potentially bring in much more money.
</p><br><p>Still, there were always lucky ones who managed to become one in a million. Their luck was incomparable, or... did it still not make any sense?
</p><br><p>’Hah, when you think about it, the chance of hitting the jackpot is less than becoming a Phantom, but that won’t protect you from the World Wipe. Although... What’s more likely, reaching my level or taking all the money from this casino with me?
</p><br><p>While Adam was thinking, Silvana walked beside him and looked at the yellow chips. Each chip is worth 100 credits, so since they paid 10,000 credits for admission, they had a hundred of these chips.
</p><br><p>Naturally, since it was a casino, anyone could replenish their account at any time. The casino had more payment options than even a large bank. Where else but here?
</p><br><p>Only if a person spent all their money or became violent would the casino employees intervene and stop that person.
</p><br><p>"Well, I don’t really blame the casinos for that." Adam shrugged, looking at the dozens of slot machines in front of him. "If they have so much luxury and money, despite offering top-notch service, then it means that people are satisfied and they bring their money here themselves."
</p><br><p>Sure, every casino had a few so-called whales, who were basically people who had too much money and didn’t know what to do with it. These people would come to the casino, lose a few hundred thousand or even millions, smoke a cigar in irritation, and leave. All to come back a few days later and repeat the process.
</p><br><p>However, there were very few such rich people, and for them, losing a few million was not a big deal.
</p><br><p>Basically, the casinos made their profits on the thousands of ordinary people who came in hoping to win a few hundred credits and ended up losing a few thousand. This rule worked for all types of casinos, both elite ones like this one and the most ordinary ones.
</p><br><p>"So, what shall we do first? Maybe poker? Blackjack? Regular roulette or how about craps?" Silvana asked. She wanted to try everything, but she wasn’t sure where to start.
</p><br><p>Adam was in the same situation.
</p><br><p>"Hah, I have a feeling we need a guide to understand what’s going on here. How about starting with slot machines? That’s the first thing I thought of when you mentioned the casino."
</p><br><p>Silvana nodded. "Hah, you’re already starting to like it. That’s what I was talking about."
</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand as they headed for a random slot machine that was free.
</p><br><p>"Don’t you think you’re being too optimistic? I mean, I’m grateful that because I’m a Phantom we have enough money, but the bitterness of defeat will stay with me for a long time."
</p><br><p>Silvana rolled her eyes and sat him down on a chair in front of the slot machine.
</p><br><p>"I’m not going to listen to this anymore." She crossed her arms over her chest. "Maybe you’re the one who’s too pessimistic? I’m a realist. I know you can lose at a casino, just like you can win!"
</p><br><p>Then, she handed him a chip with a menacing stare.
</p><br><p>"Come on, we can’t win if we don’t start playing."
</p><br><p>To their right sat a middle-aged man who had been trying to win something on his slot machine for some time. Hearing their conversation, he couldn’t hold back his laughter.
</p><br><p>"Hahahahaha, excuse me, but it’s obvious that this is your first time in a casino."
</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, by the way, it was her idea." He pointed to Silvana over his shoulder. "I know that by coming here, we have only one fate — to lose a mountain of money."
</p><br><p>Silvana frowned as the man laughed even harder.
</p><br><p>"Hahaha! Young man, your attitude is correct, but your girlfriend is right, you need a little more faith. I’ve been playing at this casino for a year and a half, and once I had a pretty big win!"
</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow.
</p><br><br><p>The man shook his head.
</p><br><p>"Nah, I’m not that lucky. However, I managed to hit a rare combination, right on this slot machine! Now I always play only here! It’s my lucky spot! Hah, just imagine, I bet 1,000 credits and won 155,000!"
</p><br><p>However, Adam was not impressed. He expected to hear something like that.
</p><br><br><p>"Wait, if this slot machine has already paid out a pretty big win, wouldn’t it be more logical to play on another one? I mean, you’ve already taken the winnings from this slot machine, so all you can hope for in that case is the jackpot, right?"
</p><br><p>The man was about to respond, his eyes shining brightly as he was ready to talk about his other winnings, but...
</p><br><br><p>Adam’s question caught him off guard. For a few moments, the man froze, not knowing what to say.
</p><br><p>"Hmm..." The man rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "How strange, I never thought about that. It’s like finding all the gold in a mine. There’s no point in digging here anymore, because all that awaits you is dirt and stone!"
</p><br><p>However, the man wasn’t upset. He slung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and waved his hand.
</p><br><p>"Thanks for your help! I’m going to look for a really lucky slot machine! You’ll see, soon I’ll be the one to hit the jackpot!"
</p><br><p>Adam smiled and sighed heavily.
</p><br><p>"He’s probably lost way more than he’s won, right?"
</p><br><p>Silvana nodded, looking at the man appraisingly.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, he looks like a lawyer. I’ve seen dozens like him. But, enough wasting time on others, we came here to win!"
</p><br><p>"Alright, alright, I hear you." Adam nodded as he inserted a chip into the slot.
</p><br><p>Then, he reached for the lever.
</p><br><p>"If we lose less than 50%, I’ll consider it a win!"</p>
