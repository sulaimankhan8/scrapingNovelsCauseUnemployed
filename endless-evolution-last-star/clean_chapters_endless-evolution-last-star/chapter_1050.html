            <h4>Chapter 1050: Black Impulse (Part 2)</h4><br><br><p>The landscapes swept by one after another to the right and left of Gladius, as if through the window of a high-speed train that was moving too fast for the human eye to see the surroundings in sharp detail.
</p><br><p>’What do you think? Where could this jolly fellow be?’ Gladius asked without slowing down his speed.
</p><br><p>Soon, he would approach the border between the Pacific Lands and the Wild Lands. He did it much faster than any of the fighters could.
</p><br><p>From the other end came the calm voice of his uncommon Operator.
</p><br><p>’Hmm... I’ve already accessed the latest recordings from his NEP, but as soon as he ended up at the Dark Shore, the connection was cut off. Things would be a lot easier if I could get inside his Operator’s head.’
</p><br><p>"Hah," Gladius chuckled, jogging over the lake. "No need to offend Silvana, she is a good one in their pair."
</p><br><p>’Yeah? Which of the two of us is a good one then?’
</p><br><br><p>’You asked the question, you answer it.’
</p><br><p>Then, he took a deep breath as a gleam ran across his eyes.
</p><br><p>’Anyway. You have some ideas, don’t you?
</p><br><p>Xyrea nodded deeply.
</p><br><p>’Sure, otherwise I wouldn’t be talking to you. From what I saw, he was fighting against a regenerative monster with a name. That girl is too weak to be from the Hollow Wave, so she’s a New Wave monster.’
</p><br><p>After a few moments, Xyrea continued.
</p><br><p>’The location where they fought... It looks suspiciously similar to the Sacrificial Waterfalls, same kind of trees, blood, and the presence of the regenerative monsters.’
</p><br><p>Gladius scratched the back of his head. He expected to hear something better.
</p><br><p>’Damn, the Sacrificial Waterfalls? They’re fucking far away! You think a black flash could move him there?’
</p><br><br><p>’Yes, I am. That’s my only guess. Even if it ended up in a different region, it should be near the Sacrificial Waterfalls.’’
</p><br><p>Gladius looked away.
</p><br><p>’What if you’re wrong?’
</p><br><p>Xyrea shrugged. ’In that case, you get there and you don’t find Adam Vinter. So no fun for you this time. I’m sure you’ll get over it somehow.’
</p><br><p>"No! No! No! No!" Gladius shook his head like a child who might have lost his treat. "It mustn’t happen! He should be there otherwise..."
</p><br><p>His eyes grew deeper as darkness thickened next to his frame.
</p><br><p>"I will destroy whatever will be there to vent out my frustration!"
</p><br><p>Xyrea waved her hand. ’It’s no longer my problem, but those who find themselves in front of you.’
</p><br><br><br><p>Streams of wind swept over the bloody river, ruffling Rosana’s ends of hair and Osmer’s loose mantle.She waited to hear what Osmer, who had been silent for a full minute, would say.
</p><br><p>Unable to bear the strain, Rosana’s voice boomed out.
</p><br><p>"Elder Osmer... Forgive me for this failure. I’m ashamed to say that I lost to some K3-Phantom, someone at my level. I am embarrassed by myself, but I want to be honest in front of you!"
</p><br><p>However, Osmer was not angry or disappointed, on the contrary, he was baffled.
</p><br><p>"Hmm..." he hummed, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. "At first, I figured you were facing an overly strong opponent that you didn’t stand a chance against in the first place. So, it wasn’t a K4-Phantom or someone higher?"
</p><br><p>"No, I’m afraid it was a K3-Phantom... Elder Osmer, I’m ready for any punishment for my failure! I showed that I’m not strong enough!"
</p><br><p>Osmer shook his head, touching her shoulder.
</p><br><p>"That won’t be necessary. Stop apologizing, I’ve told you many times that once is enough. First things first - get up."
</p><br><br><p>Then, he looked away.
</p><br><p>"Rosana, when I say you are talented, I am not lying to you. I believe in your abilities. Therefore, I realize that if you lost to a K3-Phantom, it was someone particularly capable. You said his name was Adam, right?"
</p><br><p>Rosana nodded, clenching her fists tightly.
</p><br><p>"He was much stronger than I expected. I had to fight him because he challenged me to a fight to get my key spark."
</p><br><p>"I see... But you still have it, considering you’re alive. You used your trump card smartly. The orb not only helped you escape but also gave Adam the energy he needed so he could evolve further.
</p><br><p>"You don’t have to worry about him. He’s probably already back in a human fortress. It will take him a long time to become a K4-Phantom. I’m sure you’ll surpass him, and if you encounter him again, you’ll easily defeat him."
</p><br><p>Osmer was about to leave. He was thinking about how he could make Rosana stronger, how he could use her disappointment in defeat for good, but right now Rosana needed to rest.
</p><br><p>"E-Elder Osmer... There’s something else I’d like to say!"
</p><br><p>He turned around over his shoulder.
</p><br><br><p>"Shortly before the fight ended, he mentioned a name. It doesn’t seem to be a human, but another monster."
</p><br><p>Osmer shook his hand. "Go on."
</p><br><p>"He said he regretted that I would be his last opponent, that Arnoth was more worthy of it. Who is it?"
</p><br><p>As soon as Arnoth’s name sounded, Osmer’s expression changed dramatically. His eyes opened wide in disbelief.
</p><br><p>"Arnoth...? This... Didn’t he have time to recover his strength?"
</p><br><p>For a few moments, Osmer clutched his head as his pupils trembled. He thought of all the possible events that could have happened between Arnoth and Adam.
</p><br><p>Rosana was surprised to see her elder in such a state. Such things hardly ever occurred.
</p><br><p>"So he killed Arnoth, didn’t he?" Osmer asked.
</p><br><p>Rosana nodded uncertainly. "I think so... However, I have no direct evidence. I only draw that conclusion from his words."
</p><br><p>However, Osmer had one way to test his theory.
</p><br><br><p>"Agh?" Rosana blinked, in confusion.
</p><br><p>"His aura. Was it dark and ancient by even a little bit?"
</p><br><p>Rosana nodded affirmatively.
</p><br><p>Undeterred, Osmer took a deep breath.
</p><br><p>"This is bad, very bad... It means that Adam could be here at the Dark Shore. We have to find him. This Phantom is dangerous. We can’t let humans get another star..."</p>
