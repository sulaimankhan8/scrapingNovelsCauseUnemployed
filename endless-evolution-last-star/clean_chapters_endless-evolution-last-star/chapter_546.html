            <br><p>Adam knew what he was doing, he discussed the plan with Osana many times, as well as with Franz and Rosalind, so he wasn't afraid he'd get in serious trouble for showing up at the wedding.</p><br><p>Of course, the issue was not the plan, but the fact that he used The Rule of Power, and knew that he was doing everything according to the ancient law. Explore stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>It didn't save him from Mariel, Zarot, and the others trying to kill him, but thanks to Gladius, no one else thought about fighting. As long as he was here, no one had a chance to even scratch Adam.</p><br><p>Well, despite that, there was someone who tried to kill Adam even at the cost of life.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Istrid was the one who didn't want to come here and looked the most bored and uninterested among all the guests.</p><br><p>However, when it came to some random Phantom ruining her brother's wedding and insulting her entire family, Istrid changed completely.</p><br><p>Deep down, she was proud of being a High Noble and that she was very strong for her level, surpassing most Natural Phantoms. She couldn't stand the scene of some weakling ruining everything right in front of her eyes.</p><br><p>Gladius could kill her, easily and quickly, but he didn't.</p><br><p>For some reason, instead of stopping Istrid, he just bounced back, making way for Istrid.</p><br><p>It seemed like he was setting Adam up since due to the difference in strength, he simply couldn't dodge Istrid's attack.</p><br><p>But, Gladius just saw more than the others.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The banquet hall shook violently as if in a massive earthquake, massive chunks of concrete smashing to the ground, sharp shards flying off, to the sides of the white tables.</p><br><p>The guests closest to the center ran away in fear, as far as they could in the few short seconds they were given.</p><br><p>The biggest threat wasn't even the rocks because of how thick and massive the palace roof was, but the largest crystal chandelier sitting in the center of the banquet hall.</p><br><p>This luxurious and truly expensive piece of décor, weighing several tons, was a mass that would turn ordinary people into bloody shreds. The bones and muscles of the human body could not withstand such pressure.</p><br><p>Luckily for the guests, there were no tables under the main chandelier, only a path, covered with white cloth, that led from the entrance to the golden arch at the very end.</p><br><p>The only person who was right now within range of the chandelier was a black flash filled with anger and rage, Istrid hadn't realized what was happening yet, and neither did the others.</p><br><p>'Agh...? What the hell...?' Istrid inwardly muttered, raising her gaze.</p><br><p>She saw her reflection in hundreds of transparent crystals, actively shaking like bells.</p><br><p>Her copies stared back at her while her eyes quickly filled with fear and incomprehension.</p><br><p>'No way. Did someone destroy the banquet hall? But... even Gladius, even that damn monster, acted quieter...'</p><br><br><p>The chandelier collapsed on Istrid, stopping her deadly attack. The sparkling crystals shattered into thousands of tiny splinters, flying in all directions and turning into white dust.</p><br><p>Then, the wide stone slab with a connected chandelier reached Istrid, pinning her to the ground even harder.</p><br><br><p>Istrid gasped as her eyes went wide with intense pain, then her shocked face was blocked by the debris.</p><br><p>A high cloud of dust rose upwards, preventing the Phantoms and guests from realizing what exactly happened.</p><br><p>Soon, everyone saw that there was someone among the dust veil, a dark silhouette standing in the very center, of the stone slab beneath which Istrid was buried.</p><br><p>Adam was fortunate, he didn't even have to jump away, the nearest rocks stopped at his feet along with a few crystals.</p><br><p>He like everyone else, didn't know what was going on and was curious to know who dared to do something like that.</p><br><p>'Wait... Before bouncing to the side, Gladius cast his gaze upwards, I can see it now. So he sensed that someone was heading here, but did he know who did it?' Adam pondered, clenching his fists tighter.</p><br><p>He was lucky that it had stopped Istrid, there was no telling if she could recover from this, but Adam didn't know what he should expect. This could only be the beginning of his problems. His appearance was supposed to be the only one, but it seemed fate had other plans.</p><br><br><p>The wind from outside hastened the dissipation of the smoke cloud, revealing part of the mysterious silhouette.</p><br><p>The first thing the guests saw was shoulder-length pink hair with sharp tips, oddly enough, a color that was a distinctive feature of one of the Twelve Branches.</p><br><p>Large sunglasses, with thick matte round lenses and a wide leather strap like pilot's goggles, sat on the young man's forehead, allowing the guests to see his deep-set eyes.</p><br><p>He wore a stiff, brown leather jacket with stickers down the right side of his chest, spacious baggy pants held up by a large belt, and tall black boots made for heavy hiking.</p><br><p>If it wasn't for the young man's great strength showing that he was a Phantom, one would think he was a big fan of riding single-seat aircraft or was a pilot.</p><br><p>Adam was baffled, he didn't know who this young man was whose appearance was similar to members of the Rouzet Family, except for one important detail - his eyes.</p><br><p>Mariel and Reinal had pink eyes, but this young man only had one pink eye, his left eye was purple, it looked unnatural and wrong.</p><br><p>Adam glanced around, seeing Mariel's and Reinal's shocked stares, then he looked at Osana's, her face was pale with a wide open mouth. She couldn't believe what she was witnessing right now.</p><br><br><p>Gladius's hand fell on Adam's shoulder, pointing at the young man.</p><br><p>A smirk appeared on Gladius's face as he spoke in a deep, firm voice like a seasoned auctioneer before presenting the last and most valuable item:</p><br><p>"Here he is. Baren Haltz, or formerly Baren De Rouzet. The first child of the Rouzet Family of the current generation, and the brightest star to leave his home!"</p>
