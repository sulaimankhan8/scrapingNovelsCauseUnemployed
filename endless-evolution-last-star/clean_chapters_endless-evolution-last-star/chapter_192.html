            <br><p>It might have seemed that Adam's reputation was unreasonably low. After all, he was just a simple guy until recently, and as a Phantom, he had existed for about 50 days.</p><br><p>Was it possible to do so much wrong in that time to get an F-Rank?</p><br><p>Many people would think that there are better candidates for F-Rank. What about murderers? What about rude and immoral people whose actions are not ready to be accepted by the majority of society? What about criminals?</p><br><p>Well... The situation was such that Adam already fell under each of these criteria. Did he kill a person? - Yes, and it happened in front of dozens of people. Did he engage in immoral behavior? - yes, he didn't care about the feelings of the woman, the mother of the dead Phantom.</p><br><p>But... was Adam a criminal? Sure! Only criminals would be out of jail after murder, wouldn't they?</p><br><p>Naturally, each of these situations had many nuances, but... does anyone really think that society is willing to deal with the situation? People just saw what Adam did and immediately jumped to judgment.</p><br><p>What's more, Proud Wing did their job. Obviously, to them, a Phantom like Adam who killed a man was a serious threat.</p><br><p>"F-Rank... I feel like I'm back in Fall Hill Prison again." Adam scratched the back of his head, puzzled, looking ahead. He wasn't sure how he was supposed to feel.</p><br><p>Then, his gaze traveled to Iren, who was already eager to act. Her Nexus was a long sword with a blue blade and a triangular guard. The weapon was as graceful and deadly as she was.</p><br><p>"In that case, what is her reputation? Surely the highest, right?" Adam suggested.</p><br><p>'You're practically right. There are Phantoms with more impressive reputations than Iren, but she's got a long way to go. She's got an A-Rank. To get that kind of reputation in such a short period, you have to be a truly impeccable Phantom - in the eyes of the public.'</p><br><p>Silvana continued, 'Her manners are excellent as an aristocrat she is kind since she is constantly helping people, and she hasn't done anything criminal or controversial yet. Even the Proud Wing treat her normally.'</p><br><p>Adam rolled his eyes.</p><br><p>"I get it. She is someone who is loved by those who don't know her, and hated by those who take all the glory." Adam inhaled.</p><br><p>Silvana wanted to say something, but Adam interrupted her because of the urgency.</p><br><p>"Hey... Can you make a request for help to them?" Adam asked suddenly.</p><br><p>'Why...?' Silvana raised an eyebrow, 'I can try to contact them, but it's better to wait for an official request for help. Then, you can act freely. Well, why are you even asking that?'</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly, watching the start of the battle of the Light Rain squad.</p><br><p>"Because they're going to lose. It's bound to happen."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide. She'd forgotten the last time she'd heard such unwavering confidence from Adam. He seemed to see the future, though he obviously didn't.</p><br><p>Step. Step. Step. Step. Step.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Iren stepped forward, attacking in the vanguard.</p><br><p>Next to her were two more Phantoms, one with a shield, the other with an axe. In the distance, there was a girl with a staff and a young man with a massive bow. They were in the rearguard and were supposed to cover their mates.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the young man with the bow kept looking at Iren, but not as her protector but more like a lover who couldn't express his feelings in any way.</p><br><p>"Die, you vile monster!" Iren exclaimed with a righteous look, bringing her sword down on the Prime Firebreathing Trinadon.</p><br><p>However... the monster didn't even react, while Firebreathing Trinadon was digging something in the ground among the debris, like a dog that had buried its bone long ago and was now trying to find it.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Iren's hand trembled from the intense recoil, unable to cut through the monster's tough iron armor.</p><br><p>The Firebreathing Trinadon stopped and glared at her. There was no rage or any anger in his gaze, just a slight annoyance at being distracted.</p><br><p>"Rttsk!" Firebreathing Trinadon made a strange mechanical sound before swinging his right paw, cutting through the air currents with his two long claws.</p><br><p>Iren quickly put up a block, holding the sword steady in front of her, holding her other hand at the blunt side of the blade for more stabilization.</p><br><p>However... It clearly wasn't enough to keep Iren in place. The Firebreathing Trinadon had a strength appropriate to his size.</p><br><p>The impact threw Iren aside, but she did a somersault and landed, sliding lightly on the dusty, rusty ground.</p><br><p>"Iren, I've got your back!" Romeo, the young man with the bow, exclaimed before firing an icy arrow.</p><br><br><p>The arrow simply shattered into splinters, unable to leave even a scratch on the Firebreathing Trinadon's body. It seemed that circular saws were the main weapon of the Firebreathing Trinadon, but the monster's defense and physical parameters were also at their best.</p><br><p>"Romeo, take your time." Iren calmly said while knocking the dust off her shoulders, "This monster's weak point is near its saws and neck, in the gaps between the iron plates. You shouldn't just waste your energy like that."</p><br><p>"S-Sure... I hear you!" Romeo hesitantly replied, he was afraid of doing something wrong in front of Iren.</p><br><p>Then, Iren pointed her sword at Firebreathing Trinadon, and her eyes shone brightly. Purple waves of energy traveled along the sword blade before flaring up.</p><br><p>Firebreathing Trinadon's body became much heavier, the weight continued to increase until it reached the point where the monster could no longer stand on its feet.</p><br><p>Purple streams as if separated from the northern lights, rained down on Firebreathing Trinadon, while Iren's energy was quickly drained.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes widened in mild surprise.</p><br><p>"Oh, gravity, right? This is the first time I've seen a Phantom with such powers. It's curious." Adam stared intently at Iren.</p><br><p>It seemed that she alone could defeat Firebreathing Trinadon by simply crumpling the monster into a piece of metal, but... Prime Firebreathing Trinadon was one of the strongest monsters K1-Phantom could face.</p><br><p>Iren heavily frowned as she had to grab her sword with both hands to ease the violent shaking that started after using her ability.</p><br><p>The more she exerted her power, the stronger the recoil would be - there would come a point when she would no longer be able to restrain Firebreathing Trinadon.</p><br><p>However... That was exactly the kind of situation she had mates for!</p><br><br><p>The man with the shield ran forward, causing his shield to shine brightly and explode right before it was about to collide with the monster. Although it wasn't enough to pierce through the monster's armor, it was enough to heat it up, making it less durable.</p><br><p>"Alright! That's what it is!" The young man with the massive axe exclaimed with an excited expression. His eyes glittered, and the axe flashed with bright flames, about to stab into the monster's weakened armor.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" The young man's eyes went wide as two of the monster's four arms came into motion. One saw headed to the left and the other to the right, only to whiz in front of the young man's face.</p><br><p>The next thing reflected in his eyes were drops of blood - only a fraction of the scarlet streams that rushed from the two wide cuts appeared on his chest.</p><br><p>"What the fuck..." The young man muttered, not believing what was happening while the saws were coming out of his body.</p><br><p>Adam shook his head, sighing heavily.</p><br><p>"Yeah... They're definitely going to lose."</p><br><br><p>Something fell on top of the Iron Beacon, but Adam seemed not to hear it...</p>
