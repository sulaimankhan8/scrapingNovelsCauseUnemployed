            <br><p>Sometimes, though very rarely, monsters could look even better than humans in some parts.</p><br><p>The Conqueror Jade Lady was one of those monsters, but the other Jade Ladies weren't nasty creatures and looked like humans unless one gazed into their eyes and looked above the waist.</p><br><p>However, one could never forget that Jade Lady was a monster, her double pupils, wings, and lack of legs were clear proof, moreover, humans couldn't have skin as white as a sheet of paper.</p><br><p>"Conqueror Type...?" Adam muttered, staring at the Jade Lady, he couldn't take his eyes off her. It seemed that her beauty was mesmerizing, the perfect face was enough.</p><br><p>'Yes. She comes right after the North Keeper you defeated during Eclipse. Unlike Thunder Demon, Conqueror Jade Lady usually only appears at night, but it seems Thunder Demon's roar caused her to break from her sleep and come here.' Silvana calmly said.</p><br><p>Then, she continued:</p><br><p>'The regular Jade Ladies can be found in the daytime, as you can see, the Ladies have come for their leader.'</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, I understand. She is Conqueror One, so without subordinates, she would be weaker than all the other Types. If she's that strong, it means she's smart enough to realize that Thunder Demon isn't an opponent she can attack alone." Adam narrowed his eyes, staring intently at Jade Lady, who raised her massive sword in front of her.</p><br><p>Fred breathed a sigh of relief. Out of all the options of who could come to Thunder Demon's roar, Jade Lady was the best, for their battle would be a long one - just enough time for the Phantoms to wait for help.</p><br><p>"Well, it looks like luck is on our side this time... Though I hardly have the right to say that considering how many Thunder Demon has already killed..." Fred muttered with a dark look.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Jade Lady's snow-white sword trembled, filling with the power of light like a bringer of heaven. Then, she elegantly raised the sword above her head before abruptly bringing it down.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the smooth blade of light cut through the hundreds of lightning bolts blocking her path, for one purpose only - so that Jade Lady could walk onto the battlefield, along with her subordinates.</p><br><p>Jade Lady's wings came into motion as she quickly found herself in the arena.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon's corners of mouth went up as he tilted his head, in a heartbeat, appearing directly in front of Jade Lady.</p><br><p>Jade Lady's eyes went wide, and all her four purple pupils focused on the horrible opponent in front of her. Although Thunder Demon didn't have wings, his powerful legs were strong enough to jump dozens of meters up.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon, with obvious delight in his eyes, slightly opened his jaw, showing his teeth filled with lightning energy, and then his paw fell on Jade Lady's face, clutching her head tightly.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>With a sudden movement, Thunder Demon threw Jade Lady down, aiming to damage her first.</p><br><p>However, Jade Lady was not about to let Thunder Demon take the initiative so easily and start dominating their fight.</p><br><p>She opened her wings wide, slowing her fall considerably.</p><br><p>"Damn, although she hasn't used her Type's abilities yet, but it looks like it won't be easy for Thunder Demon this time at all." Adam suggested, watching as Jade Lady's fall got slower and slower.</p><br><p>Fred glanced away with a skeptical expression on his face.</p><br><p>"Yeah, except... Have we seen what Thunder Demon can do? Of course not, that bastard hasn't been serious even once yet."</p><br><p>As if to prove his words, Thunder Demon arrogantly raised his head and quickly spun around accelerating his fall downwards.</p><br><p>Then, upon reaching Jade Lady's level, Thunder Demon abruptly stopped with all speed, collapsing his tail onto Jade Lady's stomach.</p><br><p>There was a loud cracking sound, from the damaged jade layer, and Jade Lady's eyes went wide with pain.</p><br><p>A shockwave in the shape of a wide wind ring plunged Jade Lady into the ground with such great speed that salt waves came off her fall like an explosion.</p><br><p>"Holy shit..." Adam muttered, in disbelief, realizing that this was no ordinary centipede or Dark Tyrant, this was Jade Lady - Top 3! She had to be only slightly weaker than Thunder Demon!</p><br><p>However, nothing was over yet, for Conqueror Type were not known for their physical or energy power, but for their subordinates.</p><br><br><p>Jade Lady's sword shone brightly again as she swung her massive sword several times, releasing a hail of blades at Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon narrowed his eyes, landed, and bounced to the side, dodging each blade perfectly.</p><br><p>That was the first time Thunder Demon chose not to block an attack, which could only mean one thing - Jade Lady could injure him. Thunder Demon felt it on an instinctive level.</p><br><p>Then, Jade Lady put her palm to her chest, pointed her sword at Thunder Demon, and her snow-white hair soared upwards.</p><br><p>A golden spark emerged from the tip of her sword, which instantly appeared on Thunder Demon's chest.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon looked down, scratching his chest with his sharp claws in an attempt to remove the mark, but he failed.</p><br><p>Just now, Jade Lady marked him as a target for her subordinates, and the mark would only disappear on one condition - when one of them died.</p><br><br><p>Immediately, dozens of Ladies rushed forward, aiming their swords at Thunder Demon. Their bodies were now covered in a golden glow, making them much stronger than they were originally.</p><br><p>However... Conqueror Jade Lady had a hidden ability in her enhancement that Thunder Demon was not yet aware of.</p><br><p>Not a few seconds later, dozens of monsters surrounded Thunder Demon, forcing him to defend himself.</p><br><br><p>While Jade Lady and her subordinates were fighting against Thunder Demon, someone quite strong had already reached Iron Beacon.</p><br><p>A few jumps were enough for a man with short black hair and a dark blue coat to climb to the top. Most of his body and clothes were covered in blood, but it already dried, and... only a small portion of that blood belonged to him.</p><br><p>"Damn, it took me longer than I thought to get here. Well, there's not much left." Prago sighed heavily, looking ahead.</p><br><p>Iron Beacon had the best view of the anomalies cluster, from where Prago could see everything in detail.</p><br><p>"What the fuck... Am... I... Am I dreaming?" Prago muttered in disbelief, looking at the Thunder Demon tearing apart the Ladies with gray wings.</p><br><p>'Yeah, you got that right. It all started with the arrival of the dark Phantoms, they were trying to capture Adam, but as you can see, a lot has changed from your original purpose...' The girl, Prago's Operator explained.</p><br><p>Prago glanced at Thunder Demon, at Conqueror Jade Lady, and then his gaze shifted to Tirana hiding behind the salt hill.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Prago turned to the ruins where Adam, Fred, and the wounded Ester with Romeo were staying.</p><br><p>Prago frowned heavily, literally burning Adam with his gaze.</p><br><p>"Why...? Why is he hiding?"</p><br><p>'Should I ask him that? I can request access to his channel.' The girl asked.</p><br><p>"No, Adelia, don't you dare do that. I'll find out for myself, moreover... it seems I have more important things to do..." Prago said sternly before looking to the east.</p><br><p>A dark disk was rapidly approaching the anomalies cluster, which was another monster responding to Thunder Demon's call, to his invitation to fight.</p>
