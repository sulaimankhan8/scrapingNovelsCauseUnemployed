            <br><p>Step. Step. Step. Step. Step.</p><br><p>Each of Adam's unhurried but steady steps echoed, the muffled sound bouncing off the walls as it approached Narata and consumed her like a haunting nightmare.</p><br><p>Invisible chains of fear seemed to envelop Narata completely, preventing her from moving.</p><br><p>Soon, like an inevitable fate, Adam approached Narata, looking down at her from top to bottom due to the difference in their height.</p><br><p>"Please don't touch me... I'm just a weak and talentless Phantom... nothing more..." Narata muttered in a trembling voice, but... it would be obvious to anyone that she wasn't sincere. Her fear, however, was more than real.</p><br><p>It could only mean one thing - she was afraid to tell anyone about her feelings and the reason even more than Adam in his current state.</p><br><p>Even though their first meeting happened only a short time ago, a lot had changed between the two of them. Adam no longer wore the prisoner's outfit but was dressed in dark clothes that contrasted with the snow-white needle and the dim lights in the hallway.</p><br><p>Adam paused, it seemed he wasn't quite sure how to make Narata talk. He didn't want to overdo it, he needed to keep the balance: not too rough, but not too gentle, either.</p><br><br><p>Slowly and even somewhat softly, Adam poked Narata in the shoulder with his palm.</p><br><p>"Agh!" Narata's back touched the wall as she gasped, not from the push but from shock, for Adam hadn't applied any force at all.</p><br><p>'What...? He's not going to fight me?' Narata inwardly muttered in disbelief, looking at Adam.</p><br><br><p>Without warning, silently and calmly, Adam brought his arm up to attack, sharply thrusting the needle into the wall, right above Narata's shoulder, piercing her black curly hair.</p><br><p>Adam bent over slightly, so that his serene eyes were on the same level as Narata's wide-open eyes, while she breathed intermittently due to her accelerated heartbeat.</p><br><p>She realized that if Adam had actually wanted to do this, the needle would have pierced her head, not the wall. One narrow hole would have been enough to make her eyes lose their light forever.</p><br><p>"You're very nervous, it's obvious to everyone. In that case, let's do it this way - I swear not to tell anyone what you're hiding. You have no reason to trust me, but... you only have my word, it's the best I can offer." Adam muttered before pulling the needle out, taking a step back, and canceling his Order.</p><br><p>Narata was silent for a long time as if considering all her options. She hardly had a choice, though.</p><br><p>"Fine... but not here, we'll go where there are no cameras or microphones... Follow me." Narata whispered, taking slow steps towards the door.</p><br><p>Adam nodded, silently following her.</p><br><p>After all, this was a prison, so not only the prisoners were watched here, but the Guardians and employees as well.</p><br><p>They had their own rooms, dining halls, showers, and everything they needed, but they were under constant supervision - everyone understood and accepted that.</p><br><p>However, someone like Narata, who had been working at Fall Hill Prison for quite some time, knew a place where they didn't have to worry about tracking.</p><br><br><p>At the end of the staff passageway, Narata pushed aside a stove and walked behind the wall into a narrow aisle of massive pipes.</p><br><p>Adam and Narata had to move sideways since there was hardly any space.</p><br><p>"Where the hell are we?"</p><br><p>"Before the prison was built in this place, there was a small warehouse next to where the sewer pipes ran. And... there's still a room here, though it's more of a utility room for old tools, but somewhere you could rest for a while." Narata explained before reaching the widening passageway and approaching an old wooden door.</p><br><p>Just as Narata had said, it was a back room, a small room with a decrepit table and two backless chairs. Usually, such things could only be found in slums.</p><br><p>Adam closed the door and sat quietly across from Narata, waiting for her story.</p><br><p>Narata sighed heavily, realizing there was nowhere to run, and looked up at Adam.</p><br><p>"You wanted to know why I'm here fighting Phantoms and not the monsters in Dead Lands, didn't you?"</p><br><br><p>"Well... Let me ask you one question first."</p><br><br><p>"How did you become a Phantom?" Narata asked with a serious look.</p><br><p>"I want honesty from you, so I'll answer as it is. I was lucky enough to be part of the experiment even though I'm from the slums and have no bloodline. I got Spark, then it's just like everyone else - the preparatory academy and killing a monster with the help of other Phantoms." Adam said confidently.</p><br><br><p>"Agh... Yeah, we all go through that, don't we?" Narata muttered, twirling a lock of hair. For some reason, her gaze was filled with a fleeting sadness.</p><br><p>Narata continued after a brief pause, looking at the table instead of Adam:</p><br><p>"And... What did you feel at that moment?"</p><br><p>Adam hesitated, he couldn't tell the real story since Narata didn't know about Naturalborn Phantoms, so... he quickly came up with a believable version that at the foundation was true.</p><br><p>"Well, it was a difficult day, I had mixed feelings, but overall... My dream finally came true. I became strong and got the chance to not only improve my life and my family but to fight monsters. I won't hide it, that was difficult and dangerous at first, but... it's what I've wanted since I learned about Phantoms, Dead Lands, and monsters - ever since I was a kid."</p><br><p>Narata nodded slightly.</p><br><p>"I see... Just as I thought you and I were completely different... though that was obvious from our fight. I understand you better now."</p><br><p>Adam wanted to say something, but Narata beat him to it, raising her head and making Adam's eyes go wide with a chill running down his spine.</p><br><br><p>Massive droplets dripped down Narata's cheeks and fell onto the table, breaking with bursts of grief. Her eyes were streaming with tears, and her whole body trembled as if in panic.</p><br><p>"But... Tell me, Adam... Have you ever thought that not everyone wants to be a Phantom?! I didn't choose this life!!!" Narata's scream pierced the walls, and Adam's consciousness forever sealed itself into his soul.</p><br><p>Sobbing, Narata tucked her face into her hands, not wanting to show such a self to the world - wishing to hide from everyone.</p><br><p>"I... I never wanted to fight monsters... They're scary... very scary...!" Narata cried like a child who finally revealed her secrets and inner worries.</p><br><p>"Constant training... genes... teamwork... and endless deaths...! I can barely even stand the sight of blood! What the hell kind of Phantom am I?!</p><br><p>I can't keep fighting like the others with crazy grins, covered in monster guts! I... I'm just useless trash..." Narata muttered, still not looking up.</p><br><p>It was quite some time before Adam was able to come to his senses. Narata was right, he had never thought about it - to him that was something surreal, simply impossible.</p><br><p>"Then... If you didn't want to be a Phantom... What path did you follow before this? What did you want to become?" Adam asked sincerely, still in a state of shock.</p>
