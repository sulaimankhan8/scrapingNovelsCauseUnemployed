            <br><p>An electric ray shot out of the dust cloud, parting the wind currents.</p><br><p>Drops of saturated blood flew from a light cut on the cheek, flying in front of Adam's calm blue eyes.</p><br><p>"You are now on the ground, which means you are on my battlefield, the Crimson Monarch."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Adam's fist trembled, the Crimson Monarch's eyes reflected purple streams of energy quickly enveloping Adam's hand.</p><br><p>His rings were still in the first, crimson mode. Enough time passed for Adam to use his elemental root without consequences.</p><br><p>Moreover, since his last gravity punch, he had become considerably stronger. Now, with the First Wall destroyed and three cells in the Star Seal, a single hit of his magnitude would be enough to crush the Crimson Monarch into a bloody stain.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch fully understood this. He didn't get his power by birthright, for most monsters it wasn't an option. He had fought and survived, his experience was vast and his instincts were sharp.</p><br><p>Then, only one thought filled his mind.</p><br><p>'I must evade! I must get out of the strike zone at all costs!'</p><br><p>Without delay, the Crimson Monarch sunk his claws into the sand, grasping it as a foothold. His legs tensed and his wing came into motion, all for one mighty dash to the side.</p><br><p>Before he had gone a few meters Adam's fist reached the ground, all in a second.</p><br><p>The ground shook, the landscape near the point of impact rippled, the sand mixed with snow spread apart revealing the bare, cold gray earth hiding beneath the dense layers.</p><br><br><p>Ahead of the shockwave, the flaming needle tore forward, effortlessly stabbing into the Crimson Monarch's wing.</p><br><p>Of her own will, Lone Blaze let go of the needle's hilt, making a few final slashes. The sharp blade cut the Crimson Monarch's wing in several places, but it wasn't enough, his regeneration would quickly restore everything.</p><br><p>While the needle had yet to hit the ground, Lone Blaze condensed her flames around Adam's weapon, to the point where the silver blade could no longer hold.</p><br><p>Under the pressure, the needle exploded, tearing most of the Crimson Monarch's wing apart. The outer edges remained intact, they were strong enough to withstand much more, but not the rather fragile primary membrane part.</p><br><p>Then, the shockwave reached the Crimson Monarch throwing him aside. He realized what had happened, but didn't have time to react.</p><br><br><p>A trickle of blood dripped from the corner of Adam's mouth. It was a rank gravity strike, he had done it many times before, but not under the influence of resonance and his new Nexus.</p><br><p>"Looks like I should be more careful," he muttered, glancing down at his right arm, the muscles spasming slightly, "I could take another blow, but that's the limit. Then, I'd break my arm."</p><br><p>A second later, Adam rose up, standing amidst the crater that settled by his punch.</p><br><p>His gaze traveled forward, straight to the Crimson Monarch, who was slowly rising from the sand pile.</p><br><p>"You got rid of my needle... Should I create a new one?"</p><br><p>[It was necessary. We needed to not only bring the Crimson Monarch down to the ground but also deprive him of the ability to return to the sky. There's no point in restoring a needle like the one in your wing.]</p><br><p>The painful heat resounded in Adam's chest again, the sun seal was taking control of Lone Blaze's energy.</p><br><p>The flaming needle was no longer as useful, it would take a lot of energy from Adam and Lone Blaze to create a new one, the wing had also served its purpose, they would no longer be fighting in the sky.</p><br><p>However, one of the abilities enhanced by Lone Baze remained intact. Adam's second order, fire covered his legs just like in the beginning.</p><br><br><p>In a slight movement, the broad wing split into hundreds of flaming particles, each headed for the threads covering Adam's body.</p><br><p>The fire quickly ran along the threads, looking for a place where all this power could stop, eventually ending up at Adam's wrists.</p><br><p>[I hope this helps you. It's the best I can do. My energy... it's slowly running out.]</p><br><p>Gradually, the flames turned into long bracelets covering Adam's forearms, from his elbows to his hands. It wasn't a precise piece of armor like the Crimson Monarch's gauntlets, the bracelets were fast-flowing, unsteady streams.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Can't you absorb energy from the environment?"</p><br><p>Adam was baffled. He saw how Lobe Blaze could easily restore the flame on his needle.</p><br><p>[Yeah... but, you don't even realize how much energy you're using while the sun seal enhancement is in effect.]</p><br><p>With a short delay, Lone Blaze continued:</p><br><p>[I'm not saying you should hurry up. I have enough power to keep you fighting for a long time, but I won't be able to significantly affect the outcome of the fight any longer.]</p><br><p>Without saying anything, Adam glanced at the burning bracelets, then he directed his gaze to the Crimson Monarch's damaged wing.</p><br><p>Its edges were trying to regenerate, but most of it was destroyed. Adam knew how regeneration worked, when the task was to heal something, like a cut on an arm, the process was very fast.</p><br><p>If it was to attach something, like a severed limb, even though the wound was horrible, it didn't take long if it was a Regenerative Monster or someone with strong recovery powers.</p><br><p>However, when it was necessary to create something new, to grow an arm or a wing, for example, the time span suddenly became much longer.</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, clenching his fists tightly.</p><br><p>"I see, don't worry. You've done more than enough, and so has Silvana... Now that we're on the ground, the advantage is on my side."</p><br><p>Suddenly, Lone Blaze smirked deviously, Adam sensed it.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Did I miss something?"</p><br><p>[Sure, look to the side. Don't forget, you're a Phantom, and you have far more allies on the ground than in the sky.]</p><br><p>Adam looked up when Katrin's silhouette was reflected in his eyes. She held two swords tightly, one large and broad, the other short and thin.</p><br><p>Her coat of darkness trembled slightly in anticipation, and her eyes were full of determination.</p><br><p>A bitter smile showed up on Adam's face.</p><br><p>"Well, well..." he shook his head, remembering the past, "There's no way she can calm down, right? Hah, looks like I'll have to fight alongside her again. Do I have a choice?"</p>
