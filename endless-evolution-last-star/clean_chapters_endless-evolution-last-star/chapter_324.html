            <br><p>After starting to fight Light Yellow Threat monsters and defeating some of the strongest monsters of the Purple Threat Level, Adam felt that he was already closer to the K2-Level than ever before.</p><br><p>He was already strong enough to defeat the weakest monsters from the next level, which was usually either impossible or extremely difficult for most K1-Phantoms.</p><br><p>However, Adam had realized earlier that surpassing his capabilities was possible when he, Edir, and Kayla defeated Prago in Fall Hill Prison.</p><br><p>The difference between Light Yellow and Purple Threat Level was huge, but manageable under the right conditions. Sure, a lot depended on Phantom's power and whether he was enhanced with the supports.</p><br><p>However, there was an unspoken rule that Adam didn't know about. If K1-Phantom defeated any of the Top-10 of the Purple Threat Level, it meant that he was capable of fighting the weakest monsters of the Light Yellow Threat Level.</p><br><p>This rule also had an addition. If K1-Phantom defeated anyone from the Top-3, then he could fight stronger monsters than the bottom of the Light Yellow.</p><br><p>Obviously, since Adam had killed Essence Thunder Demon and Prime Thunder Demon, he was one clear example of this rule working.</p><br><p>Adam wasn't the only such case, there were quite a few capable people among the K1-Phantoms, but... even among them, only a small fraction met the true peak of the K1-Phantoms.</p><br><p>Most K1-Phantoms, even those like Adam who had stayed at the K1-Level for a long time due to various reasons, had not encountered one particular monster from the Top-10 of the Purple Threat Level.</p><br><p>Sure, not all K1-Phantoms had even seen all the monsters from the Top-10 from afar, but the appearance of each of them had a certain chance. Oddly enough, even Snow Followers weren't the rarest of the Top-10.</p><br><p>Yeah, the rarest of all Purple Threat Level monsters was the Top-1, the Plague Reaper, and that was a real blessing for all Phantoms and Citadel.</p><br><p>First of all, Plague Reaper could only appear at night, there was no record of Plague Reaper showing up during the day or even at sunset. It seemed that this monster simply hated sunlight, preferring the moon and the darkness of night.</p><br><p>Secondly, Snow Followers or Thunder Demons could appear for something interesting or to take part in an exciting battle. Especially Thunder Demons, even though they were Top-2, they were encountered quite often during various incidents.</p><br><p>But, none of this applied to Plague Reaper. This monster appeared extremely rarely and for unknown reasons. However, none of that mattered, because right now, Plague Reaper was in Fume Cathedral, sitting on top of Fume Throne.</p><br><p>Facing Plague Reaper was the worst thing that could happen to K1-Phantom, as his strength was far superior to his closest opponent - Essence Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper hadn't made a single attack yet, but its aura, movements, and arrogant gaze were more than enough to imagine what this creature was capable of.</p><br><p>"Lero! Are you alright?" Erla excitedly exclaimed running up to Lero who had earlier vomited from behind Plague Reaper's aura.</p><br><p>"I don't know... It's... it shouldn't be like this. I wasn't scared in front of Prime Thunder Demon, but his aura just nailed me to the ground..." Lero muttered with genuine horror in his voice.</p><br><p>The others were feeling about the same. Katrin and Oskar's legs were trembling, and Osana clenched her fists tightly.</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that Plague Reaper didn't use The Will or his Spirit. It was a simple form of aura that every strong monster or Phantom had.</p><br><p>Lero, Erla, and the others didn't even want to imagine what would happen to them if Plague Reaper decided to use his aura at full power, not to show his superiority but to attack.</p><br><br><p>While the Phantoms were trying to regain consciousness as the monsters huddled in a corner like scared puppies, Fog Hunter stepped forward confidently.</p><br><p>His tall, lean body moved relaxedly forward, leaving scratches on the stone floor from the sharp claws on his feet. He stared at Plague Reaper as if it were his rival, no... as if it were a true Purple Threat Level upstart.</p><br><p>Fog Hunter thought that Plague Reaper was worthy of sitting on Fume Throne and looking arrogantly at everyone else.</p><br><p>To Fog Hunter, Plague Reaper was a monster who possessed impressive strength, but he was still one level lower than Fog Hunter.</p><br><p>Fog Hunter was not going to tolerate such insolence from a lower-level monster.</p><br><br><p>With his next step, Fog Hunter stopped right in front of Plague Reaper, who was sitting on the throne still in the same pose. One leg was thrown over the other and his cheek was resting on his hand with a bored look.</p><br><p>"ROOOOAAAAAARRRRRR!!!!"</p><br><p>Fog Hunter roared furiously shaking the air with his piercing scream and sending streams of wind around, some of which reached Oskar and the others.</p><br><p>"Fuck, what's that power?!" Oskar frowned, covering himself with his hand from the wind streams.</p><br><p>Fog Hunter let out this roar to scare Plague Reaper, but the aftermath primarily affected the others, showing that Fog Hunter was serious.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Fog Hunter swung his elongated arms over Fume Throne, slicing through the air with his long, sharp claws.</p><br><p>With the speed and power of his limbs, Fog Hunter was able to create several wind blades that flew straight over the stone throne, crashing into the wall nearby.</p><br><p>All of this should have seriously frightened anyone, and it did. Now, the monsters and Phantoms were not only scared by Plague Reaper but also by Fog Hunter's power.</p><br><p>"Wait...? Are we really going to see them fight now? Could this be our chance to get out of here?" Erla suggested with hope in her eyes. She like everyone else didn't want to stay in this nightmare any longer.</p><br><p>For the Fume Statues to help them get out of here they needed to make another victory, but that was hardly possible since the Fume Judge was in no hurry to start the next fight.</p><br><p>Lero actively nodded a few times.</p><br><p>"Yes! Guys, Erla is right. Even if it's Plague Reaper, he won't be able to defeat Fog Hunter too quickly. The other monsters are badly scared, this might be our chance to escape through the side gates and head towards the safe zone!" Lero exclaimed with excitement in his eyes.</p><br><p>Oskar glanced at Lero and Erla before nodding deeply.</p><br><p>"Right... That could work. As long as the Fume Judge is distracted, we can walk alongside the Fume Armors, they shouldn't be able to touch us." Oskar muttered in a shaky voice, looking around.</p><br><p>Katrin bit her lip. She didn't want to leave here because Scarlet Pyromancer was still here, but she wasn't going to argue.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper wasn't some ghostly threat, he was real and he was right in front of them. If he wanted to, he could definitely kill most of those in Fume Throne.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, while Oskar and the others were preparing to stealthily leave, Fog Hunter grinned widely and tilted his head towards Plague Reaper.</p><br><br><p>Fog Hunter opened his jaw wide, revealing dozens of sharp fangs inside. However, this did not scare Plague Reaper at all.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper simply moved closer to Fog Hunter and opened his mouth slightly, letting out black air.</p><br><p>Then, as soon as this air entered Fog Hunter's mouth, Fog Hunter's body began to shake violently until the monster fell to the ground, already dead.</p>
