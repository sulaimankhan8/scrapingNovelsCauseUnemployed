            <br><p>As a K4-Phantom of the Red Bears, Orel had extensive capabilities, much more than the other people at the Lower Ring.</p><br><p>It was no problem for him to send the person he needed to the Cave Grid. However, there was no prohibition on Phantoms visiting the caves, no matter if they were members of the Four Beasts, the most important thing was that they check in at the gate.</p><br><p>Descending to the first floor of the tower, Adam rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p><br><p>"So I have to kill any Four Star monster? It doesn't matter what kind of monster it is, right?"</p><br><p>Orel nodded weakly keeping his hands in his pockets. "Yeah, I'm not a mission department. The others and I don't really care about which monster dies. The most important thing is that your victory is over someone strong and significant, S4 Monster is perfect for that."</p><br><p>Then, he turned to look at Risha.</p><br><p>"You're going with her. She wanted to go to the Red Zone a while ago, but she heard that a Light Phantom was coming here soon. She went to the Outer Field and as you can see she got lucky."</p><br><p>Suddenly, Adam's expression became more serious as he remembered Erik and the commander's words.</p><br><p>"Wait... So you knew I was coming? No, more importantly. How did you know that?"</p><br><p>"Hah, don't think about it too much," Orel shrugged nonchalantly. "The Upper Rind and the Lower Ring are connected. The higher your position, in both rings, the more you know about everything that happens in the Citadel. It's natural."</p><br><br><p>Orel stepped forward, stepping out of the elevator and leading the others with him.</p><br><p>"I mean, you wouldn't be surprised if Damien's Operator knows about the darkest secrets that neither you nor I know about, would you?"</p><br><p>Adam only nodded weakly in response. By the behavior of the three thugs' reactions, he realized that they didn't know that exactly he was coming to the Lower Ring. They were expecting a Light Phantom, and they got it. Risha managed to find out his name, but she was just lucky that he was right where she expected him to be.</p><br><p>'But...' Adam frowned inwardly. 'I doubt it would be a problem for the heads of Four Beasts and Wilfred to follow my every move. I've come a long way, but compared to them I'm still nothing.'</p><br><p>Then, Risha caught up with Orel, looking at him with a frowning brow.</p><br><p>"Wait, brother! Why would I go along with him? I'm capable of fighting monsters on my own!"</p><br><p>"Hah, sure, but an S4 one is still beyond your strength. You recently fought against an S3 and what came out of it?" Orel glanced at her.</p><br><p>Risha gulped. It was only a few days ago. At the Lower Ring, no one took weeks or months off, everyone kept working and fighting, no matter what happened before.</p><br><p>For Risha, the battle against the last S3 monster had been hard fought. She won, but barely made it back to the Red Tower, where Orel had to gather people to heal her and bring her back in shape.</p><br><p>There was no shame in that. For K3-Phantom to defeat an S3 Red Threat monster was a decent result, but it showed that an S4 monster could be a deadly opponent for her.</p><br><p>Orel waved his hand. "Just stay with Adam. You help him navigate the Cave Grid, after all, it will be the first time for him. In the meantime, you'll be able to learn something from him."</p><br><p>"Argh? Learn from him? Are you kidding me!"</p><br><br><p>Orel gave her a flick, causing Risha to fall to the ground in surprise.</p><br><p>"Hey! Why did you do that?!"</p><br><p>"Yes, when you have the opportunity to see a strong Phantom fight, you should take advantage of it. Don't forget, he defeated you in just one minute and didn't even use his full potential."</p><br><p>With puffed-up cheeks, RIsha turned away. She knew that Orel was right. She didn't expect a Phantom from the Upper Ring to be so much stronger than she was. Adam had simply destroyed her, and all she could do was accept it.</p><br><p>Suddenly, behind her came Adam's voice.</p><br><p>"Hey, Orel, I don't mind going with Risha to the Red Zone. I'll be the one to kill the S4 monster anyway, but what about Silvana?"</p><br><p>Orel turned around looking at Silvana standing next to Adam.</p><br><p>"From what you've told me, I doubt Misa and Glen are going with you and Risha at the Cave Grid, are they?"</p><br><p>With a short pause, Orel nodded deeply. "Don't worry. Silvana will be safe. I can assign her a room at the Red Tower or in other buildings in the Red Bears territory."</p><br><p>Adam was about to say something, but Orel cut him short.</p><br><p>"If after our conversation you still don't trust me then I can take Silvana to the government officials. I'm sure considering you're a K3 Light Phantom they'll agree to protect Silvana and provide her with whatever she needs."</p><br><p>Not saying a word, Silvana looked at Adam. She didn't know which option was best, it was up to Adam to decide.</p><br><p>With a slight nod, Adam looked at Orel. "Fine, let Silvana stay here at the Red Tower. I'm sure she and Misa won't be bored."</p><br><br><p>"But..." Adam stammered. "How do we communicate? At the Red Tower, are there rooms specifically for the Operator? And, even if there is a computer, what about a database, a list of monsters, maps?"</p><br><p>"Yes, I was going to ask about that too," Silvana walked over to Adam.</p><br><p>Orel rolled his eyes. "You don't have to worry about that. There are no military and forts at the Lower Ring, but the main website for Operators has all the information you need about the Cave Grid. By the time you get down to the Red Zone, Misa will show Silvana everything. There's nothing difficult about it."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes moved to Misa, she smiled kindly promising her support. After all, at the Lower Ring, the more experienced Operators were helping the younger fellows.</p><br><p>"What about headphones, cameras, connection?" Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Oh, providing all that isn't a problem, but..." Orel glanced at Misa and Silvana. "I think it would be much better to teach you one useful trick. Hehehe."</p>
