            <br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes - he didn't want to face the nobles again. Not because he was afraid of them or did anything bad, but because they always gave him a lot of trouble.</p><br><p>"So..." Adam stretched out scratching the back of his head, "This is where the nobles go to see who is more talented and stronger. Whoever collects five coins gets not only freedom but recognition in the nobles' society, which to them is worth more than any treasure."</p><br><p>Without pausing, Adam finished with a heavy sigh:</p><br><p>"And... None of them will want to lose, for it's a disgrace to them and their family. Also, you can only forfeit a coin if you lose a fight, you can't just throw it away."</p><br><br><p>Andreas's measured clapping sounded from the side.</p><br><p>"You got it right. There are other Phantoms here at the Twilight Palace who are not nobles, but they are quite a few."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, he was curious to know the reason why.</p><br><br><p>He understood that there were a lot of Phantoms among the nobles due to their strong bloodline, especially among the Twelve Branches, but there were a lot more ordinary people, so that should even the odds.</p><br><p>"Well, the higher the level, the more you start to meet nobles. Thanks to their families' extensive resources, bloodline, and connections with instructors, nobles are just less likely to die on missions - that's just the way it is."</p><br><p>With a slight wave of his hand, Andreas continued:</p><br><p>"At K0-Level the percentage difference is monstrous, it seems like nobles don't exist, but at K3 and K4 levels it's a completely different situation. Moreover, those nobles who are motivated to become the best are willing to do a lot to gain power."</p><br><p>However, Andreas's speech did not impress Adam at all. He only rolled his eyes with a snort.</p><br><p>"Pfffft, I've seen what a Marzo Family nobleman can do."</p><br><p>A sly glint traveled across Andreas's eyes as the corners of his mouth went up.</p><br><p>"Oh, you're talking about Nirosh Marzo? Heh, I've seen that fight."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam flicked a glance at Andreas, "Were you at the Moon Colosseum that day?"</p><br><p>Andreas shook his head.</p><br><p>"No, but I got an invitation from a mutual acquaintance of ours."</p><br><p>Adam didn't understand who Andreas was talking about, but it was obvious to Silvana:</p><br><p>'Gladius... He's talking about the demonic auctioneer, isn't he? I still don't know how he did it, but he had access to the personal contacts of the most powerful people and nobles... I wonder if it was all done by his Operator and... who is his Operator?'</p><br><p>Andreas waved his hand not wanting to dwell on this topic for too long:</p><br><p>"Nirosh Marzo was trash. He was a nobleman first, not a Phantom, and that's what ruined him. Most Phantoms who have reached K3-Level are different from him."</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Andreas's voice grew harsher and darkness seemed to begin to gather around him.</p><br><p>"If Nirosh Marzo hadn't undergone a global change that affected his personality, he would never have destroyed the Two Walls and filled the Star Seal. He couldn't accomplish that by forever remaining in the confinement of his limits as K2-Phantom."</p><br><p>"But..." Andreas's voice wheezed, "The nobles here, who came for victories and recognition are different. Not all K3-Level nobles are like this, there are scum like Nirosh Marzo, but there are far fewer of them."</p><br><p>A chill ran down Silvana's back. She wasn't stupid and realized that Andreas was no ordinary man, both in status and in nature. She felt it as well as the Operator. However, his words were unnecessarily harsh, especially towards one of the higher nobles who died at Adam's hands.</p><br><p>"So, Mr. Adam." Andreas stared at him, "You shouldn't think that the nobles at the Twilight Palace are the same as the Nirosh Marzo, especially from the First Four Great Families, of which there are most, since the First Wing is their home."</p><br><p>Adam turned away with a bored look. Andreas's eyes went wide for a moment, he hadn't expected such a reaction from Adam.</p><br><p>"If you're trying to scare me with nobles, it won't work. I've seen Damien fight, I've seen what Gladius's aura can do. It doesn't matter if you're a nobleman or a commoner, all that counts is how strong you are as a Phantom."</p><br><p>Before Andreas could say anything, Adam's cold eyes met his.</p><br><p>"Damien doesn't come from a noble family does he?"</p><br><p>For the first time in their long conversation, Andreas was confused which was evident in his frozen face.</p><br><p>"Mr. Adam... I don't think it's appropriate to discuss Mr. Damien. After all, you have another task at hand."</p><br><p>"'You're avoiding an answer?" Adam muttered, "Fine, you've mentioned these four families so much that even I got curious."</p><br><p>Without delay, Adam added:</p><br><p>"Tell me about them, from the looks of it they are the ones I will meet at the Twilight Palace. However, I don't understand one thing. Why are there four of them? Shouldn't there be one great family in each wing?"</p><br><p>Andreas chuckled, his hands disappearing behind his back.</p><br><p>"The First Ring is divided into nine wings, meanwhile there are twelve great families. From the second to the ninth wing there is one family each, and four families are located at the First Wing. They all compete with each other for the right to be considered first among the Twelve Branches."</p><br><p>"Hah." Adam grinned, "What about Kogen Noukx? He rules at the ninth wing and I'm sure he doesn't give a fuck what happens elsewhere. For him, there are no hierarchy rules between the higher nobles."</p><br><p>Andreas nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Well... I won't argue, this time. However, Kogen Noukx is a special case, he is dangerous and spectacular. All I'm saying is that the offspring of the first four great families face tremendous pressure from their parents, society, and environment their entire lives."</p><br><p>A hint of darkness reflected in Andreas's eyes as he continued:</p><br><p>"They seek approval and achievement. Their only way to feel that they have succeeded is to become the strongest and rise above the other nobles. Obviously, you will be an easy target for them."</p><br><p>"And...?" Adam shrugged nonchalantly, "I don't know what you or Douglas expect of me, but I'm not going to linger here or take the initiative."</p><br><p>Without waiting for Andreas's response, Adam stepped forward, heading towards the entrance of the Twilight Palace.</p><br><p>"I'll rest and get out of here. I'm not interested in the other stuff."</p><br><p>Before Andreas could react, Adam was already at the door, about to leave the passage.</p><br><p>Silvana looked at Andreas and Adam, not knowing what she should do.</p><br><p>Realizing that the conversation was over, Andreas smiled bitterly and walked over to Silvana, holding out his right hand to her.</p><br><p>Under her eyes, he opened his palm offering three Twilight Coins.</p><br><p>"Ms. Silvana, you must take the three coins from me or we will be in trouble. I don't know what Adam will do, but I suggest you keep an eye on him. He needs to rest for starters. He's spent a lot of time under the queen's influence, much more than expected."</p><br><p>With a serious expression full of desire to fulfill her role as Operator and loyal partner, Silvana nodded deeply before taking the three twilight coins.</p><br><p>"Sure, I'll do my best, but... Mr. Andreas."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Andreas raised an eyebrow meeting her determined gaze.</p><br><p>"I doubt many nobles came to the Red Zone and walked out with a victory over the Overlord Type monster, destroying their walls and filling the Star Seal. At the same time - Adam did it."</p><br><p>Andreas didn't have much to say. He smiled kindly like an old man, took a step back, and bowed slightly as expected of a butler.</p><br><p>"Good luck to you. Who knows how soon you'll be leaving the Twilight Palace and how many coins you'll have by then, five or zero?"</p><br><p>A hint of arrogance reflected in Silvana's eyes, but she was too modest to let that feeling play out.</p><br><br><p>Soon, the creak of the door reached Andreas's ears, signifying that Adam and Silvana left.</p><br><p>Casting a glance towards the iron door leading to the platform, Andreas pondered.</p><br><p>'Douglas... You're a sly fox as always. You know that, unlike Adam, the nobles care about him. After all, he killed one of them and won at The Rule of Power.'</p><br><p>Slowly, imperceptibly to Andreas, a sinister smirk grew on his face.</p><br><p>'These young arrogant bastards dream to get such a meaningful victory, to show their dominance and achieve triumph at the Moon Colosseum. But... it means nothing to Adam. If it weren't for Osana's cunning plan, he would never be involved.'</p><br><p>Then, Andreas walked to the wall, put his palm to a specific spot. A hidden passageway opened a second later, allowing him to escape to a place inaccessible to Adam or any other visitor of the Twilight Palace, be it north for the Phantoms or south for the rest of the common people.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Adam and Silvana closed the door behind them, finding themselves in the middle of a spacious passage with high ceilings, luxurious chandeliers, and seemingly endless hallways with no end.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, an alert came through on Adam's NEP and Silvana's phone.</p><br><p>Adam quickly opened it as a detailed map of the hotel appeared before his eyes, a veritable guide to the entire Twilight Palace, for getting around this place blindly was a long, even torturous task.</p><br><p>They glanced around, looking at the doors in the distance.</p><br><p>"Hmm... What should we do first." Adam muttered thoughtfully.</p><br><p>He noticed Silvana's gaze on his hair.</p><br><p>Then, the corners of his lips went up.</p><br><p>"Well, it's time for a style change." Adam waved a gesture, slipping his hand into pocket, "Come on Silvana, after all this place is a grand hotel. This place should have everything!"</p>
