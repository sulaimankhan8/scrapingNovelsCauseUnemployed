            <br><p>Adam frowned, the creature before him was very different from the monsters he faced before.</p><br><p>It wasn't even the creepy tentacles coming out of the long jaw, or the intimidating appearance of the Thirst Redeemer, but the way this monster behaved.</p><br><p>The best predators were among the beasts, this was due to their instincts, physical capabilities, and unique features such as natural disguise or keen eyesight.</p><br><p>But, the best killers in nature were definitely insects, and therefore the monsters that had a lot in common with them.</p><br><p>Adam sensed that the Thirst Redeemer wasn't going to fight him, it was going to kill him so that Adam would become part of the bloody river, offering his life and flesh for the glory of the upcoming ritual.</p><br><p>"Alright, let's see what you're capable of. From the looks of it, you're far from the most common opponent, right?"</p><br><p>Without haste, Adam looked around. He saw many other monsters he didn't know, the only ones he recognized were Carnage Jaws running near the riverbank in clumps and a few Sacrificial Holders, long vines growing out of their backs, but not attacking anyone.</p><br><p>But, there was not a single Thirst Redeemer among them. He realized that they might have been hiding like his opponent, but now he had a threat right in front of his face.</p><br><p>The red smoke quickly reached him, but couldn't touch him as it burned in the bright flames from his needle. Stay connected via My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Hey, any idea what this freak is?" Adam asked looking closely at the Thirst Redeemer.</p><br><p>'The Thirst Redeemer, rare and dangerous, usually dwells in Nests or Strongholds submitting to a stronger creature, it's similar to how the social order works in insects. But... I have no idea what this mist is or where it got its tentacles from.'</p><br><p>Adam's pupils dilated. This was the second time the monsters in the temple possessed features Silvana didn't know about.</p><br><p>'First the Sacrificial Holders, now they...' Silvana muttered, uncertainty filling her voice, 'It seems this temple appeared quite some time ago, the monsters never left here and absorbed what they found from above or below ground. That's how they evolved, gaining new abilities, at least that's my theory.'</p><br><br><p>Adam nodded deeply making a sharp swing of his needle, the flames burned away most of the smoke. He didn't know what would happen to him if the red smoke touched him and didn't want to find out.</p><br><p>The Thirst Redeemer realized that such an attack against Adam was useless, so the monster slowly stopped releasing smoke, but its tentacles started moving much more actively.</p><br><br><p>Tentacles, like dark harpoons, launched at Adam, becoming stronger than steel cables. Adam was in no hurry to attack, so he took a few steps back, dodging with minimal movement. The tentacles slammed into the ground right at his feet, shattering the surface and plunging deep down.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Particularly long tentacles traveled up the slope, emerging from the bottom and digging into the wall leading to the serpent seal.</p><br><p>"Hey, I have full control over your flame, don't I?" Adam asked, but he wasn't addressing Silvana.</p><br><p>[Sure, as long as you use the needle since the sun seal affected your First Order.]</p><br><p>With a face devoid of emotion, Adam stepped forward, gripped the handle of the needle tightly, and plunged it sharply right into the middle of the thickest and longest tentacle.</p><br><br><p>Purple clots of blood rushed outward, and a few fell onto Adam's cheeks, but his eyebrow didn't even twitch, this was just the beginning of his attack.</p><br><br><p>At a quiet, calm word, flames ran along the tentacle right up to the Thirst Redeemer's jaw.</p><br><p>Then, a red flame, a scalding blaze engulfed the Thirst Redeemer, reaching to the edges of its long, ghastly body.</p><br><p>For the first few seconds, the protective chitin did its job, shielding what lurked beneath the tough shell, but... soon the Thirst Redeemer's flesh began to burn.</p><br><p>No screams or roars came from the monster, like the real insect, it already accepted its fate, which meant there was only one proper option - to take its foe to hell with it.</p><br><p>Its two long hind legs curved like a grasshopper's, allowing Thirst Redeemer to make a high-speed leap while its body wasn't yet turned into a handful of dark ash.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes remained calm, seeming to expect something like this.</p><br><p>"Yeah, a warrior would have accepted his defeat by now, but you're a simple assassin..."</p><br><p>Taking a step forward and ducking low, Adam dodged the Thirst Redeemer's front legs aiming for his head.</p><br><br><p>Like a true swordsman, Adam took a wide sweep of his needle, directing a stream of flame from bottom to top.</p><br><p>It was enough to cut the Thirst Redeemer in two, starting with its long jaw and ending with its entire massive body.</p><br><br><p>The two burning halves crashed into the walls, rolling to the lower level, just a few meters from the banks of the bloody river.</p><br><p>Several Carnage Jaws running nearby, glanced as wide grins appeared on their faces. Before everything could burn, the Carnage Jaws quickly ran up to the remains of the Thirst Redeemer's body and began tearing it into large pieces.</p><br><p>True, the flames were dangerous to the Carnage Jaws as well, but as soon as the piece of flesh disappeared into their maws and their jaws closed the fire went out.</p><br><p>"Well, well... Somehow I'm not even surprised." Adam muttered watching the dozen small but aggressive monsters.</p><br><p>Then, his eyes narrowed intently as he watched them change, the Carnage Jaws getting a little bigger, their sturdy legs trembling and their teeth getting longer and sharper, while their large eyes were actively filling with blood.</p><br><p>Soon, Silvana's voice echoed in his head.</p><br><p>'What are you going to do?'</p><br><p>Adam shrugged, approaching the edge of the slope.</p><br><p>"Like I have a choice. My temporary ally said I don't have much time, so we have to hurry, don't we?"</p><br><p>Lone Blaze answered nothing, but everything was clear from its earlier words.</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam jumped down the slope looking at the bright lights in the distance.</p><br><p>"Well, at least I know my target, that's half the battle."</p>
