            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1236: Advice</strong></p><br><p>The three K0-Phantoms were returning to the Bastion Opard, their home, along with the military and two K4-Phantoms. This was not a common occurrence by any means.</p><br><p>But that was the situation, and the only reason for it was Adam.</p><br><p>This time, it worked in his favor. He and Fromund saved three young Phantoms.</p><br><p>Sure, they were only K0-Phantoms, and according to statistics, most Phantoms died before reaching K2-Level or higher, but maybe one of these three would be able to achieve something significant. There was always a chance.</p><br><p>Adam spent the entire flight in silence, while Fromund actively communicated with the three newcomers. He was curious about what the young Phantoms did, especially those living in one of the Bastions rather than in the Citadel.</p><br><p>In a different situation, immediately after landing and leaving the fighter, Adam and Fromund would have headed to the Citadel using teleportation.</p><br><p>However, they both needed rest and medical attention, especially Adam. Maybe his arm didn’t prevent him from walking among the zones with weak monsters, but for now, he couldn’t take part in more serious trials.</p><br><p>The Citadel had everything necessary to quickly heal him, but the Bastion Opard was no worse.</p><br><p>Each Bastion had the same technological development as the Citadel. The key difference was that the Citadel was larger, and only the Citadel had Queen Elisa.</p><br><p>Thus, Silvana and Arayna had already agreed that the military of the Bastion Opard would take care of their Phantoms after their long mission and heavy battles.</p><br><br><p>Adam was walking calmly toward a building away from the runway when he heard someone’s voice behind him.</p><br><br><p>Adam turned around, puzzled.</p><br><br><p>The golden-haired guy ran up to him.</p><br><p>“Before you go, I’d like to ask you one question.”</p><br><p>Adam shrugged. “Sure, go ahead.”</p><br><p>The young man clenched his fists tightly and asked with a serious look in his eyes:</p><br><p>“Advice. What advice would you give me? I know you’ve progressed faster than most. I want to be as strong as you one day!”</p><br><p>It seemed like it should be easy for Adam. If this young man wanted to achieve what he had, then he had to do the same.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s lips parted as he was about to say something, but he stopped at the last moment.</p><br><p>‘No, what was I going to do? Tell him to fight in any situation? To take even the toughest risks and go against all odds?’</p><br><p>Something changed in Adam’s eyes, they became deeper, filling with meaning and maturity.</p><br><p>Adam realized that with that advice, he would most likely kill the golden-haired guy.</p><br><p>‘Damn, I didn’t think it would be this hard. He wants advice, but… if he follows my path, he’ll definitely die, and probably quite early. I can’t give him that advice, but lying could be disastrous.’</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam was right.</p><br><p>If the golden-haired guy had charged at the skeleton with his staff instead of retreating with his mates, he would have died just seconds before Adam and Fromund arrived.</p><br><p>‘But…’ Adam looked at the young man. ‘I have to say something to him. I can’t just turn around and leave.’</p><br><p>Soon, a slight smile appeared on Adam’s face as he awkwardly scratched the back of his head.</p><br><p>“Actually, it’s not the kind of advice you’re probably hoping for.”</p><br><p>“Agh?” The golden-haired guy tilted his head. “What do you mean? I don’t quite understand.”</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>“Don’t follow any advice. Well, at least not when it comes to fighting and the Dead Lands. You have to choose your own path and figure out what works best for you. It may take time, and it may not be easy, but it will be much better than following someone else’s path that doesn’t suit you.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, the golden-haired guy nodded deeply.</p><br><p>Adam was right. The answer wasn’t as precise and simple as the young man would have liked, but even though he was young, he understood that it was good advice.</p><br><p>“Thanks. I’ll keep that in mind!”</p><br><p>“Hah.” Adam chuckled. “Good luck.”</p><br><p>Then, he and Fromund walked away as the soldiers led them to the medical facilities.</p><br><p>It was a brief encounter between Phantoms of different levels, but the experience was useful for both sides.</p><br><p>Silvana smiled slyly.</p><br><p>‘Hah, maybe you should take on some apprentices in the future? Most people in your position would have given some trite advice like: Don’t give up! Work hard! See it through to the end! And so on.’</p><br><p>‘Pffft! Never in a million years! I have too many things to do and problems to deal with to spend time on someone else.’</p><br><p>‘Well, in any case, you did better than I expected. What are you planning to do next?’</p><br><br><p>‘You know what. The conditions of the Path Construct have changed a little. I don’t know what the Desire of Beyond is, but the hearts… I’m quite familiar with them.’</p><br><p>‘Yes, but before you only needed one of them, now you need both.’</p><br><p>With a serious expression, Adam nodded deeply.</p><br><p>‘Sure, and eventually I’ll get both. There’s no other way. I’ve already used the Connected String, so I know where to go. As soon as I get back to the Citadel, we’ll find that place.’</p><br><p>With a short pause, Silvana gulped.</p><br><p>‘That way you’ll get the Connected Heart, but the Dark Heart… the Hybrids. You’ll have to find one and fight it. I mean… It’ll be a new and not easy experience, right?’</p><br><p>Adam bit his lip. He understood where Silvana was going with this.</p><br><p>‘Yeah, in my time, I’ve only encountered two Hybrids, and both of them are humans and my allies. I don’t know what to expect from Hybrid monsters. I understand that they are the majority and that they are essentially just a unique type of monster, a path of development that they have chosen.</p><br><p>‘But, still… I can’t shake the feeling that this battle will be different from the ones I’m used to fighting against monsters.’</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply.</p><br><p>‘Well, let’s heal your arm first. After that, we can decide what to do.’</p><br><p>A sharp gleam flashed across Adam’s eyes.</p><br><p>‘Sure. My arm… it hurts.’</p>
