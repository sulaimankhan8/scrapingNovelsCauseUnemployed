            <br><p>From the very beginning of Adam's journey as a Phantom, the needle was the foundation of his power. It was not only his first ability and weapon but also a reminder of the origin of his Initial Gene - the first needle was bound from threads.</p><br><p>Now the threads became part of his Initial Gene, but his needle continued to evolve, reaching its strongest form to this point as the Branch Order.</p><br><p>The first person to see Adam's new ability was Risha, who watched with wide-eyed eyes at the same Phantom as she was.</p><br><p>Adam's body was covered in blood. His wounds hadn't disappeared, but he felt the damage much less. His energy had become much denser, making his body stronger as well.</p><br><p>The wounds that could make him bleed out before now only made him breathe harder. Bleeding became much weaker, and regeneration became higher.</p><br><p>But Risha's eyes quickly traveled lower.</p><br><p>In Adam's left hand, a white needle was neatly clutched between his fingers, its edges blurred, trembling due to the powerful essence. Something about that needle made Risha take a step back, she didn't want Adam to use that weapon against her.</p><br><p>Then, she looked away as her face turned as pale as a sheet of paper.</p><br><p>Adam's right hand also held a needle, but this one was strikingly different. The needle with a broad blade sharp on both sides was as big as a great sword, one swing was enough to split a large monster into two equal parts.</p><br><p>The hilt, sheathed in black bandages, had enough room for a two-handed grip, but Adam held the weapon with only one hand.</p><br><p>As before, there was a small hollow in the center of the needle, perfectly sized for a small, ordinary needle.</p><br><p>Dark streams of smoke billowed from the sharp blade, broad closer to the hilt and tapering to a tip like a massive arrowhead.</p><br><br><p>Heret and Vorx crashed into the walls, debris crumbling to the ground. Then, two shadows flew out of the clouds of dust, surrounding Adam.</p><br><p>A trickle of blood dripped from Vorx's corner of his mouth, and there was an obvious bruise on Heret's hand.</p><br><p>"Adam..." Vorx wheezed. "Did you actually do it?"</p><br><p>In response, Adam nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yeah, it was harder and more spectacular than I expected, but as you can see..." Adam pointed to the two needles. "I did it."</p><br><p>Heret glanced at Vorx, then returned his gaze to Adam.</p><br><p>"In that case, we have no more fighting to do. This time, Vorx and I were wrong, and you proved to be right. However, it was risky. If you didn't shatter the fourth lesser gates, it would cost us days for your recovery."</p><br><p>Vorx laughed. "Hahaha, now we're going to need that time! Adam, you got hurt more than we did, but... your blows proved to be painful."</p><br><br><p>Adam's harsh voice left them stumped.</p><br><p>"Agh...? What do you mean?" Vorx was puzzled.</p><br><p>Heret, in turn, became wary with a heavy frown.</p><br><p>In response, Adam gave them a kind grin, pointing the first, sword-like needle at Vorx.</p><br><p>"Our fight may have come to an end, but not the training. You defeated me when I had all abilities active and three open gates.</p><br><p>"But... Now, things have changed. In a way, the situation has turned upside down."</p><br><p>Adam raised the first needle, and the darkness thickened around the blade, shivering with excitement.</p><br><p>"One of my abilities and four open gates against you two. Who do you think will win?"</p><br><p>Before Vorx could say anything, Adam's right hand turned into a blur. The first needle came down.</p><br><p>The dark blade sliced the ground in two, rushing toward Vorx like an unstoppable force.</p><br><p>No matter what Vorx felt or wanted to say at that moment, then his entire mind shifted to his monster instincts.</p><br><p>Flames ignited at his feet as he turned into a fiery flash, quickly escaping to the right.</p><br><p>Amidst the shards and shattered crystals, he couldn't see his reflection in the blade, though it was black and dense.</p><br><p>It was pure destructive energy.</p><br><br><p>With a shudder in the air, Adam appeared in front of him, white energy, copying Vorx's flames, covered his legs, making him significantly faster.</p><br><p>"Oh, looks like I lied," Adam smirked. "Besides my Branch Order I also use the Global Gene, I hope you won't take offense to that."</p><br><p>Vorx put up a block a second before Adam's foot slammed in.</p><br><p>The impact threw Vorx to the edge of the Magma Plateau, his fall ending in a plunge into the lava lake.</p><br><br><p>Heret stepped forward, his aura working at its limit as the ground cracked beneath his formidable footsteps.</p><br><p>"Adam... You have grown stronger, but Vorx and I are not weak enough to lose to the one ability of a wounded Phantom."</p><br><p>The intimidating green flames covered his figure again, but this time, it only caused Adam to smile slightly.</p><br><p>It seemed that only Risha realized that he was waiting for this moment.</p><br><p>'He stayed one-on-one with Heret on purpose?' she thought, her eyes running around. 'He used the first needle against Vorx, so... now it's time for the second, small one?'</p><br><p>Adam nodded. "Heret, your ability is as strong as your unusual flame. You attack so quickly and sharply that it is almost impossible to react."</p><br><p>Heret was wary, he narrowed his eyes preparing to attack, a dangerous glint running down his sharp claws.</p><br><p>"However... I possess a similar ability, did you know that?"</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Heret grumbled. "Why didn't you use it before then? I thought you showed us your full arsenal."</p><br><p>A short chuckle erupted from Adam.</p><br><p>"Because this ability is too complicated. I can't control it, even now, after I destroyed the fourth lesser gates, I can't use it at will."</p><br><p>"It doesn't seem to be the most reliable ability."</p><br><p>Adam nodded. "Yeah, it is. But, now I have the opportunity to use some of that power. Your surge against mine, who will be faster?"</p><br><p>Without warning, Adam swung the second needle, leaving a white line in the air with a pulsating dot in the middle.</p><br><p>Heret's eyes went wide as his flame trembled. He was about to burst forward.</p><br><p>But... it was already too late.</p><br><p>Adam was behind him in the blink of an eye.</p><br><p>Beneath Heret's shocked face, a torrent of blood rushed from his chest, flooding the bright earth.</p>
