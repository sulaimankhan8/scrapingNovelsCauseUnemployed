            <br><p>Two threads were a manageable number for Adam that he could control with fairly high precision.
</p><br><p>He long ago discarded thoughts of fully wielding fifty threads or more, for now, it was beyond his power.
</p><br><p>But, training, as well as his Second Order, allowed him to deftly control his Initial Order in such a reduced but no less powerful version. Discover exclusive content at NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><br><p>Two threads of their master’s will tied around Adam’s wrist exiting beneath his palm. He gripped his new weapon tightly, feeling the weight of the thick and dense threads made from energy meant for a dozen of them.
</p><br><p>Fromund blinked a few times with his eyes wide open.
</p><br><p>’Right... Considering what I saw before, it’s no surprise that he has now summoned the threads to fight me.’
</p><br><p>Then, his gaze lingered on the silver threads for a long time.
</p><br><p>’Hmm... There are only two. To be honest, I thought that these were just the first, that there would be many more later.’
</p><br><p>With a deep nod, Fromund clenched his sword tighter.
</p><br><p>’That’s good. In that case, all I need to do is cut or burn them, let’s try the first option for now. After all... I don’t have much strength left.’
</p><br><p>Feeling that his body was far from its peak, Fromund smiled bitterly before casting his gaze to the side for a moment - he looked at Elva, Liv, and Tilda.
</p><br><p>From somewhere, packs of chips appeared in their hands, a smile with a slight twinge of surprise appearing on Fromund’s face.
</p><br><p>’Damn, I’m sure they could have asked for something more dignified for themselves. Though... that’s the point of this kind of food, right? You shouldn’t be distracted by the taste, all your attention should be focused on the fight.’
</p><br><p>A white gleam reflected in Fromund’s blue eyes as the whistling of the wind reached his ears.
</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Fromund turned his body, swinging his sword.
</p><br><br><p>Sparks flew in front of Fromund’s face with the next two silver threads.
</p><br><p>Losing their speed and trajectory due to the collision with the black sword, the threads crashed into the ground, leaving deep cuts on the damaged arena.
</p><br><p>True, this was only a small part of what would happen in a meteorite crash, but their fight wasn’t over yet as well as their abilities.
</p><br><br><p>The threads like fishing lines returned to Adam, ending up between his hands like whips.
</p><br><p>Fromund’s eyes narrowed, staring intently at the threads.
</p><br><p>’I see... Even though it was a direct hit, right in the blade, I couldn’t even scratch them. That’s too bad, they’re too strong.’
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, the corners of his mouth curved up, revealing a sly grin.
</p><br><p>’Well, that just means I have to go with the second option, doesn’t it?’
</p><br><br><p>The dark streaks on the sword slowly turned red, heating up thanks to the weapon’s internal energy.
</p><br><p>Streams of red flame covered the sword blade, burning the air around it, causing space to warp as if in a very hot desert.
</p><br><p>Clutching his threads tighter, Adam took a step back.
</p><br><p>"The same trick? First the burning hammer, now the burning sword? What’s next? Fire breath?"
</p><br><p>In response, Fromund nonchalantly shrugged with a wave of his hand.
</p><br><p>"Hahaha, don’t make me laugh. What do you think I am some kind of lizard or dragon? I’m a human, I don’t know how to breathe fire."
</p><br><p>"Is this coming from someone who recently invoked a fucking meteorite?"
</p><br><p>"Yeah, because you could destroy a meteorite with a simple needle! You think that’s okay?"
</p><br><p>Adam rolled his eyes, though there was logic in Fromund’s words, it didn’t work at all.
</p><br><p>"You still haven’t shown some of your powers, but don’t worry, I’ll make you do it."
</p><br><p>Sensing Adam’s slight tension, Fromund smirked wryly.
</p><br><p>"What if I decide not to do anything else?"
</p><br><p>"Well, then you lose." Adam gripped his strings tightly, his gaze cold and sharp, "Unlike you, I don’t need to move a heavy sword using all my muscles, I just need to do this-"
</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam swung his arms from top to bottom like a coachman trying to set his horses in motion.
</p><br><p>Carefully following the threads, Fromund took a few steps to the side, the first thread collapsed into the ground beside him, while the second one crashed into the prearranged wide blade of his sword.
</p><br><p>Clang. Clang. Clang.
</p><br><p>The barrage of attacks was just beginning. Adam repeated the same motions over and over again, bringing his threads down on Fromund with rapidly increasing speed.
</p><br><p>His opponent was bearing the pressure, but it was getting harder to do so with each passing second.
</p><br><p>Grasping the thick hilt, moving his massive sword up and down with minimal amplitude to block all the threads, Fromund frowned.
</p><br><p>’I thought I could get into full defense and gradually the threads would burn off the flames. They crash into my sword several times in a second, they’re almost always in flames, but... given their size and the speed at which they travel through the air, they seem to cool down quickly enough.’
</p><br><br><p>While it wasn’t a problem for Fromund to keep track of the threads so far, it was an impossible task for many viewers.
</p><br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda watched with bated breath as the white flashes from the collision of the threads endlessly appeared on the black sword’s surface.
</p><br><p>Time after time, Fromund successfully blocked each of Adam’s attacks, the impact forcing him to move back, he didn’t take a single step, his feet just slid along the ground leaving two dense streaks.
</p><br><p>But... Adam was only accelerating.
</p><br><p>His right pupil narrowed and the amber grid glistened, allowing him to see what was previously inaccessible, in that minute he had become completely accustomed to the threads.
</p><br><br><p>Splash. Splash. Splash.
</p><br><p>From time to time, the threads flew off the sword and passed near Fromund, leaving light cuts on his face, arms, body, and legs.
</p><br><p>The crimson drops flew off to the sides, but they didn’t even have time to reach the ground, the silver threads shattering them, eager to inflict another wound on Fromund.
</p><br><p>’Alright, it seems defending yourself wasn’t an option. Although, I made him expend a lot of energy. I just need to destroy his threads, and then I can attack!’
</p><br><p>With these thoughts, Fromund stepped forward as his sword lit up even brighter.
</p><br><p>He retracted his defense, putting himself at risk, but Fromund was sure that it was Adam who was in danger now, not him!</p>
