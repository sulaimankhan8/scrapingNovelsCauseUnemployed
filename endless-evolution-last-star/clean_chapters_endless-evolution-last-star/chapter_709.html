            <br><p>Apparently, the military as well as the departments had all the information on every Phantom that was currently on a mission.</p><br><p>Adam was no exception, he never tried to hide from his duties and saw nothing wrong in maintaining contact with the military.</p><br><p>He understood one simple thing - for ordinary people, the military's commands were orders that had to be obeyed under any circumstances, but...</p><br><p>For the Phantoms, they were just requests that didn't have to be obeyed.</p><br><p>'What? Adam! This is serious! You can still go back to the Citadel right now, or you can build a fortress defense with the other Phantoms!'</p><br><p>Silvana didn't stop, she didn't know what Adam was thinking, but she tried to reason with him. She believed that the sudden Eclipse was a serious threat. Well, she wasn't wrong.</p><br><p>"Hey, calm down. I'm not going back to the Citadel after all I've accomplished in the fortress."</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes glazed over as two lone silver threads swept in front of him. His gray coat fluttered in the powerful currents of wind, growing stronger as he fell from the spire.</p><br><p>"Just like I'm not going to waste my opportunity to destroy the First Wall to help the other Phantoms. I've defeated three Commanders - that's more than enough to easily defend the fortress."</p><br><p>With a confident look, Adam swung his threads, pulling himself towards the nearest building before bouncing off the wall and landing amongst one of the hundreds of passageways.</p><br><p>Purple light reflected on his face, not far away was a stream of flame with a hovering rune.</p><br><p>The Shadow Walkers turned their heads, staring at Adam in confusion. Now and then their eyes dropped to the ice cross, unsure of what to do.</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Don't even think about it, I'm tired of fighting you off. Just mind your own business, I'm only interested in one thing right now." Read exclusive content at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, black particles reappeared around Adam. They were much thicker now, pointing downward with an active shudder.</p><br><p>The Shadow Walkers understood Adam, taking his words as a command, and none of the monsters paid any more attention to him.</p><br><p>Unlike the flaming spear, the ice cross didn't point Adam in the direction of the three statues, but he didn't need to anymore - he knew all the secret passages.</p><br><br><p>A few minutes before most of the Phantoms should reach the fortress, Adam stopped in front of the cold, stone wall.</p><br><p>No matter how many Phantoms came to the fortress, none of them would stop at this wall, as they did not possess Adam's knowledge.</p><br><p>Reaching his hand forward, Adam tapped on the wall several times as if it were the door of a closed house.</p><br><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p><br><p>The muffled sound indicated there was nothing behind them, but it didn't take long for the answer to come.</p><br><p>Four black lines appeared as if there was a secret passage behind the wall, and part of it was true.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Two heavy legs lifted the Prime Stone Mimic, its massive eye staring intently at Adam while four arms pointed downward.</p><br><p>Glancing at Phantom, the monster shrugged and stepped aside, one hand inviting him in.</p><br><p>Adam's corners of his mouth went up forming a satisfied smirk.</p><br><p>"Hah, I don't know how strong you are, but I don't have time to fight you. It's going to be a living hell here soon, and... what are you going to do in that case? Just keep being a wall and pretend nothing's happening?"</p><br><p>The Prime Stone Mimic did not respond in any way, it only pointed towards the second arm once more.</p><br><p>With a sad sigh, Adam shook his head and walked on.</p><br><br><p>The Prime Stone Mimic returned to its place, closing its eye and falling into slumber until its actions were needed again by the fortress.</p><br><p>Walking down the caverns, in complete darkness, Adam heard Silvana's voice.</p><br><p>'So... As usual, you chose any option but the one on the list of options, right?'</p><br><p>Adam smiled weakly, quietly continuing his descent down the familiar path. Last time he constantly felt like someone was following him, but now the caverns were safe as the Mighty Commander had been defeated.</p><br><p>"Not true. I'm just accomplishing my task."</p><br><p>Silvana tilted her head in confusion.</p><br><p>'Hmm? What are you talking about?'</p><br><p>"I didn't know there was going to be an Eclipse, no one did, but that doesn't mean I should abandon my mission. I came here to kill the monster to destroy the First Wall, and do what is necessary to get to my goal."</p><br><p>The gurgling of water from two waterfalls sounded in the distance, the three statues were close.</p><br><p>"If I had originally agreed to defend the fortress from the waves of monsters, I would do my best, but I came here for a different reason. That's why I didn't return to the Citadel, although I realize that I was one of the few who had the opportunity to do so."</p><br><p>Silvana didn't say anything. She understood Adam's position and accepted it, it wasn't the first time he'd done so.</p><br><p>His boots sank into the low water before stepping onto the stone path leading to the round platform.</p><br><p>It was a while since his battle against the Might Commander, so the small lake returned to its usual, clear color along with the dirty crimson one.</p><br><p>Suddenly, Adam's eyes went wide as he glanced around.</p><br><p>"Agh...? Where the hell is he...?"</p><br><p>For some reason, there wasn't the Mighty Commander's corpse on the platform, it simply disappeared as well as the blood and any trace of their fierce battle.</p><br><p>"Hmm... Well, I'll be able to find out soon enough. There's only one thing left to do, right?"</p><br><p>Adam raised his head standing in front of the last, third statue that, unlike the other two on the sides, was part of the cave, with its back against the wall.</p><br><br><p>The ice cross shuddered, quickly transforming into a massive ice sword that was very different from the one used by the Blind Commander.</p><br><p>"This is weird..." Adam narrowed his eyes as he watched the sword take its place in the statue's hands.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The cavern shuddered as a wave of blue energy headed towards the round platform, igniting the remaining third of the runes.</p><br><p>Adam slowly turned around, his gaze confident and calm as he realized that there was only one way things could go.</p><br><br><p>The center part of the platform moved aside, opening a passage into the depths and allowing a bright red light like a hot young flame to come out.</p>
