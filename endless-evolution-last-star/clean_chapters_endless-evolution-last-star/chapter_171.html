            <br><p>The water monster was ready to devour anyone in its path, and even the solid floor that wasn't its target was shattered into many pieces, covering everything around it with thick cracks.</p><br><p>Edilr, Kayla, and Adam's eyes went wide. They had almost no time to think of how to defend themselves in such a situation - since dodging was pointless!</p><br><p>With each passing meter, the water monster grew larger, as did its wide jaws with sharp, long teeth. The monster had already traveled to the middle of the arena, and that made it so massive that there was nowhere to run!</p><br><p>Edir looked at Kayla, nodded slightly, and rushed forward, ignoring Adam completely, though he was ready to take the damage if necessary.</p><br><p>Well... It was part of their plan, but not Adam, Edir, and Kayla's, but what Kayla and Edir were discussing amongst themselves, without Adam present.</p><br><p>They realized that Prago probably had some trump card, for he had to have a strong, destructive ability that he possessed as a K2-Phantom.</p><br><p>In that case, there was a very simple question - which of the three of them should have sacrificed himself the most? Who should have received the most serious wounds?</p><br><p>Logically, it should have been Adam and Edir since Kayla could heal them and help them recover quickly, but Edir and Kayla had decided a different way.</p><br><p>They looked at the situation from a contrary perspective: If Prago is in a position where he has to use his trump card, it will be his last action and a harbinger of the end of their fight.</p><br><p>In that case, there was no point in Kayla's treatment - if Adam and Edir couldn't fight after facing Prago's Third Order, Kayla alone wouldn't be able to stand up to Prago.</p><br><p>Edir and Kayla decided to take all the damage since Adam was the one who needed to put the least amount of effort into breaking through Prago's defenses. His abilities weren't as devastating as Edir's, and couldn't help the team like Kayla, but piercing armor was his specialty, somewhat.</p><br><p>'Agh...? What are they doing?' Adam inwardly muttered, not understanding why he didn't know anything about this.</p><br><p>"Wait! Stop!" Adam exclaimed, trying to catch up with them.</p><br><p>Edir waved his hand before summoning his Second Order:</p><br><p>"Just do your part. As you can see, even against a weakling like him, it's not easy at all." Edir smirked, channeling all of his energy into a flaming orb.</p><br><p>Kayla in turn activated her First Order over and over - summoning streams of leaves, healing herself with Edir, and tearing the water monster apart. However, she was only able to do minor damage.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, there's no way you can handle this! Nothing will help you!" Prago exclaimed with a mad look. He was sure that he had already won. In his worldview, it was impossible for K1-Phantoms to be able to block K2-Phantom's powerful attack.</p><br><p>"Hey, idiot, do you want me to tell you something?" Edir shouted as an insidious smirk appeared on his face.</p><br><p>Prago's received a lost look.</p><br><p>"Though the elements infused with energy and therefore different from normal and do not obey the usual laws of physics and chemistry, but... the base remains. I mean, it's rather reckless to threaten me with water when I possess ice!" Edir exclaimed with excitement, before unleashing his full power in a single stream of flame.</p><br><p>Prago's eyes went wide, he realized that Edir was right.</p><br><p>Sure, ordinary water wouldn't be able to extinguish the Phantom's hot fire, but if the Phantoms' powers were equal and one used fire, and the other water, the first Phantom was at a disadvantage due to the vulnerability of the elements.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The water monster was trying to engulf the frost flame stream, but it wasn't easy to do so. Parts of the water were constantly freezing, turning into ice, and falling to the ground only to shatter into tiny splinters.</p><br><p>All the Phantoms in Fall Hill Prison were watching this scene intently as if the outcome of their battle was being decided right now.</p><br><p>However... only Edir realized that this was not the case. He was experienced enough to see how even his icy flames were quickly depleted in the jaws of the water monster. </p><br><p>'Well... I've done enough... Though, there's something I'm still capable of...' Edir internally mumbled with a bitter smile before his hands erupted in bright blue flames.</p><br><p>His body was already at its limit as well as Kayla's, they had used their Orders too often, but thanks to Kayla's ability, they could continue.</p><br><br><p>The water monster, having lost half of its power, ripped Edir's flaming stream, coming straight towards him.</p><br><p>"Even if I can't destroy you, I'll make the most of it!" Edir exclaimed before sharply clapping his palms together, causing a massive flame explosion.</p><br><p>Then, in the final seconds, Edir dashed to the side, grabbing Kayla and moving as far away from the epicenter as possible.</p><br><p>The shockwave threw them apart, tearing Edir's back and causing them to crash into the wall at high speed.</p><br><p>Edir and Kayla were completely exhausted, they could barely stay conscious - getting further into the fight was out of the question. Now, only Adam was left, but... the water monster was not yet defeated!</p><br><p>The water monster was about 1/10th of its original size, but it was enough to inflict terrible wounds on K1-Phantom. If Adam wanted to survive, he had to defend himself somehow!</p><br><p>Adam's eyes flashed as silver threads covered his left arm, transforming into a massive gauntlet with sharp claws.</p><br><p>Blood rushed from Adam's mouth, his body was already at its limit, but he had no choice but to continue. There was simply no other way.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>The water monster's teeth sank into Adam's left arm, tearing the silver threads apart, yet shattering one by one.</p><br><p>Each time, the teeth sank deeply into Adam's arm, releasing blood and tearing his flesh, bringing with them waves of vivid pain, but... soon this torture was over.</p><br><p>Massive drops of water fell to the ground as the last thing left of the water monster and Prago's Third Order.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..." Adam was heavily breathing as he looked at his torn left arm. Streams of blood flowed down from the torn wounds covering his entire limb. It was so bad that he couldn't even clench his hand into a fist - the muscles and nerves were severely damaged.</p><br><br><p>Prago fell to one knee while blood flowed uncontrollably from his mouth. He had used all his abilities several times, moreover, he had received many injuries during the battle, so he was also at his limit.</p><br><p>In fact, it was unlikely that they had enough strength to just approach each other, but... in their case, they didn't need it to damage each other.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Above Prago appeared his Spirit, slowly approaching Adam. His The Will was unstable and weak, struggling to hold its form.</p><br><p>"Guess I don't have any other choice, do I?" Adam muttered, realizing that he couldn't afford to get hurt by the aura. He had to confront it!</p><br><p>Adam reached forward, summoning his Spirit, and feeling his Aura Seal begin to tremble.</p>
