            <br><p>At the Lower Ring, the relationship between the Phantom and the Operator worked differently from how it did at the Upper Ring. However, the strongest changes were only for K0 and K1 Phantoms, because at the Lower Ring, these Phantoms most often didn't even have Operators.</p><br><p>Operators didn't have academies or the opportunity to learn while working for the military, but they turned to their elders for help.</p><br><p>The Four Beasts members and the government people working at the Lower Ring created a database covering the Cave Grid so that the K2-Phantoms and above could get information from their Operators as if they were at the Upper Ring.</p><br><p>However, this only benefited the K2-Phantoms who only recently got Operators.</p><br><p>Sure, it was useful for the K3 and K4 Phantoms to have their Operators inform them of monsters and locations ahead, but they didn't use earpieces, microphones, and the system created in conjunction with the government to communicate.</p><br><br><p>Orel moved his chair over, sitting down at the table where only Adam and Silvana were beside him. At this time Risha and Misa were waiting outside the Red Tower. Misa was encouraging Risha, preparing her for another descent at the Cave Grid.</p><br><p>"Why did you bring us here?" Adam raised an eyebrow, confused.</p><br><p>"Well, I could have stuck an earpiece in your ear and not wasted my time, but I couldn't do that. Consider it a gesture of goodwill."</p><br><p>Orel crossed his arms over his chest.</p><br><p>"Adam, as you've already realized, the Crystal Gates are letting the K3-Phantoms reveal new powers gradually. You and Risha both unlocked the second lesser gates."</p><br><p>"Agh? You got that from the fact that I used the Stellar Resonance?" he asked.</p><br><p>"Nah, I can see it based on the density of your energy. Though, for another K3-Phantom, it's unlikely to be possible. Risha wouldn't be able to realize how many lesser gates you opened until she saw the Stellar Resonance.</p><br><p>"But, I didn't bring you here to discuss the Crystal Gates or the third lesser gates. I want to make things easier for you and myself."</p><br><p>Adam leaned back in his chair, looking at Orel with slight disbelief. "How?"</p><br><p>"At the K2-Level, the Operator has the option of going into a special chamber where the Evolution Seed is located. Silvana can easily do that right now and see her Evolution Sprout, isn't it?"</p><br><p>Silvana nodded several times. It was as easy for her as it was for Adam to be in his inner space.</p><br><p>Orel continued. "At the K3-Level, when you obtained the Stellar Resonance, Silvana found herself in your inner space. Moreover, even from as early as the K2-Level, you possess a shared sight, Silvana can utilize your energy and you can determine her location."</p><br><p>"And...? What are you getting at?" Adam swung his hand.</p><br><p>"Well, you no longer need a microphone, earpiece, or NEP to communicate with your Operator. All of that will be a thing of the past."</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana glanced over, stunned.</p><br><p>"Mr. Orel..." Silvana muttered. "I understand what you're saying, at the inner space we did make it, but..."</p><br><p>For a moment, Silvana blushed remembering under what circumstances Adam had opened the first lesser gates.</p><br><p>"I don't know how to enter Adam's inner space. Moreover, even if I knew how to do it, it wouldn't be effective. Adam would have to constantly dive into his inner space to hear me. During combat, that could be dangerous."</p><br><p>Orel shrugged. Silvana was right. If they were going to communicate using Adam's inner space, they needed a smooth and fast method, seamless.</p><br><p>"Sure, don't worry, I wouldn't have brought you here if I couldn't help you right away. Think of it as an enhanced version of the shared sight or shared voice...? Something like that."</p><br><p>Adam leaned forward, his hands folded together.</p><br><p>"So, I won't need to open the third lesser gates for this?"</p><br><p>Orel shook his head. "No, it will be quick and easy. If you do it right, of course."</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana exchanged glances. Then, Adam nodded deeply, his gaze serious.</p><br><p>"I see. Tell me what we need to do and what we end up with. I'll be able to hear Silvana like through an earpiece?"</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Orel rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "No, her voice will come straight into your mind. Something similar to how your Evolution Tree communicates with you. What's more, it will work both ways as a shared sight.</p><br><p>"And, you don't have to worry. It doesn't extend to your thoughts. Something like this could only happen during the Gene Diffusion."</p><br><p>They didn't say anything, but smiles of relief appeared on their faces. No matter how well they knew and trusted each other, thoughts were too fleeting and had to be kept to themselves.</p><br><p>"Fine, let's not waste any time. Adam, take Silvana's hand and channel energy to her, not too much but not too little either. There should be enough energy for Silvana to feel it."</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam sprang into action. He was confident in his control over the energy and that he wouldn't hurt her.</p><br><p>Orel turned to Silvana. "Now you. Once you sense Adam's energy then close your eyes and try to say something to Adam. As soon as Adam repeats the word then that means you have succeeded.</p><br><p>"It sounds simple, but you need a steady flow of energy and trust in each other as in shared sight. You must allow not only your vision to go between the Evolution Tree and the Evolution Sprout but also your voice. Only in this way will you master the shared voice."</p><br><p>Soon, Silvana shuddered as she closed her eyes; she grasped Adam's energy flowing down her arm.</p><br><p>Then, Orel yawned, throwing one leg over the other.</p><br><p>"It usually takes one to three hours. Try to finish sooner or Risha will whine about waiting too long."</p><br><p>In reality, Orel was willing to wait considerably longer. He knew it could take hours for some, as besides understanding, luck was crucial here.</p><br><p>Suddenly, Adam's calm voice sounded:</p><br><br><p>Orel's expression froze.</p><br><p>Then, Silvana nodded weakly.</p><br><p>"Yes, that was my word. It turned out to be much simpler than I thought."</p>
