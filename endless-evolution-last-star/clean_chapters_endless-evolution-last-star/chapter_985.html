            <br><p>The fight that should have ended with Risha's death finished without such serious consequences.</p><br><p>Vorx, Grita, and Torz were baffled, they didn't understand why Radiant Mirage had spared Risha and how that fit the terms of their agreement.</p><br><p>For Adam, everything was well-known since he was the organizer of this fight and the opportunity for Risha to become stronger.</p><br><p>The only one who could figure out what was going on was Heret.</p><br><p>"Hmm... I see, so whether she wins or loses didn't matter from the beginning, right?" Heret muttered thoughtfully rubbing his beard. "Radiant Mirage wanted to see that she was a worthy ally to whom he could turn in the face of a threat. As an artifact, it was essential for him to find out so they could continue their journey together."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, a slight smile appearing on his face. He watched the mirror knight, his great body shattering into hundreds of tiny fragments.</p><br><p>"Yeah. In fact, considering how strong Radiant Mirage was, Risha originally had no chance of winning. At the Magma Plateau, everything works in Radiant Mirage's side, giving him energy and capabilities that Risha doesn't have."</p><br><p>With a slight sigh, Heret glanced forward. He didn't need to say anything else, it was as apparent to him as the fact that it was good news.</p><br><p>It didn't matter who got stronger: Risha, Adam, himself, or any serpent from the resistance. It all increased their chances of winning. Maybe slightly, but it was far better than nothing.</p><br><p>But Vorx still had several questions.</p><br><p>"W-Wait... What if Risha would have won and not proven herself reliable as a partner?" he tilted his head in confusion. "I mean... Theoretically, it could have happened to someone else, right?"</p><br><p>"Well..." Adam lingered. "Then it would be the bad news. The terms of the pact would be honored. The Phantom and the External Artifact would have to work together even though they wouldn't trust each other. Sooner or later, it would have led to a disaster."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The mirror knight disappeared, as well as the mirrors, one by one.</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage, standing in the center, his silhouette trembling, glanced at Adam.</p><br><br><p>Until the last second, Radiant Mirage maintained a disgruntled expression but finally smiled and nodded in thanks.</p><br><br><p>In a few steps, passing through the hovering crystals, Adam approached Risha.</p><br><p>Their battle was not an illusion or friendly sparring, it was a fight where one of the outcomes could be death.</p><br><p>"Well, well... I don't think I'll ever be doing this. But now it's my turn to help others get stronger," Adam chuckled briefly as he looked at Risha. She was breathing heavily.</p><br><p>Blood covered most of her body, she would need a few days and help for all her wounds to heal, but she was alive, and that was the most important thing.</p><br><p>Adam turned around, and Heret and Vorx were heading in his direction.</p><br><p>"You have serpents who can heal her, right?" Adam asked.</p><br><p>"Sure," Heret waved his hand. "Two or three days and she'll be fine. She'll sleep most of that time just like you, but she won't have much time to prepare."</p><br><p>"Well, I think she'll make it," Adam ran a glance over her before turning to the two serpents. "What about you? When are you ready to start your training? I mean... You helped me, now it's my turn to help you!"</p><br><p>Vorx and Heret exchanged a glance.</p><br><p>"Hah, two weeks ago, I was fighting this guy on equal footing, and now he's talking to us like that," Vorx smiled. "Shit, I can't stay weak for too long!"</p><br><p>Heret didn't answer anything, but it was clear from his look that he agreed with his friend.</p><br><p>Then, Adam realized something important.</p><br><p>He didn't need to be the strongest to teach someone. He could help others even if he was only a little stronger. The most crucial thing was that he wanted to and knew what to do. The rest was just a matter of time.</p><br><br><p>Just as Heret had said, two and a half days later, Risha woke up.</p><br><p>She was not in the resistance caves but at the Magma Plateau. She had new clothes on and not a single drop of blood, even her hair was clean and silky.</p><br><p>Someone had looked after her while she was out.</p><br><p>Moreover, Risha felt much better than before. She felt like she had more energy, but that wasn't entirely true.</p><br><p>"What...?" she rose from the flat crystal, looking around. "What's happening to my energy?"</p><br><p>Suddenly, her eyes went blank as she found herself in her inner space. Someone had forcibly brought her here.</p><br><p>Risha was confused. This had never happened before.</p><br><p>"Stop looking like an idiot."</p><br><p>A bored voice sounded behind her.</p><br><p>Risha turned around to see Radiant Mirage, who was nonchalantly standing amidst the darkness.</p><br><p>He appeared the same as when they had formed the pact, except now he was in her inner space instead of the other way around.</p><br><p>"How did you end up here...? No, what am I doing here, and what's happening to my energy?" she warily asked.</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage raised an eyebrow. "Your energy? Pffft, it was just a freaking mess! It took me all day to get all the currents into efficient paths. Do you have any idea how much work I did? Argh?"</p><br><br><p>Several minutes passed, and Risha still didn't respond.</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage narrowed his eyes. 'Have I gone too hard?'</p><br><p>Before he could say anything, Risha smiled weakly. ''Thank you. Thank you for your work. Now that you've corrected the flaws in my energy, I feel much better."</p><br><p>For a moment, Radiant Mirage's cheeks flushed, but he quickly regained his cool expression.</p><br><p>"Whatever. I was obligated to do this as your External Artifact anyway. Before me, your Initial Gene only contained the essence of some other artifact. I destroyed it and turned it into free energy. It might have made you a little stronger," he waved his hand.</p><br><p>Risha gulped. "I see... What happens next?"</p><br><p>A sly grin played across Radiant Mirage's face.</p><br><p>"It's time for me to take my place! As for you, get ready for a new ability!"</p>
