            <br><p>A massive silver needle hovered above Adam, like his faithful protector ready to deal with any opponent.</p><br><p>The needle trembled slightly. It was semi-transparent and somewhat blurred, like a shadow of the true power of Adam's The Will.</p><br><br><p>Trana and Krana's ghosts were torn apart, but they recovered quickly, taking some energy from their masters.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh... It's hard... It's really hard..." Adam whispered with a dark look. With each passing moment, he felt rivers of energy drain out of him, for one purpose only - to keep The Will active.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes darkened, but... He was experienced enough to realize that it was unacceptable to shut down at a moment like this. He would either win or lose, he simply had no other option.</p><br><br><p>Adam swung the needle, leaving a long and deep cut on his left arm - from shoulder to elbow. It didn't damage his arm in any way in terms of functionality, as the muscles and tendons were intact, but, it gave Adam what he so desperately needed - clarity.</p><br><p>A bright flash of pain cleared his field of vision, removing the blurriness and giving Adam some time to sort out the threats.</p><br><p>'Alright, I'm not sure I know how to use this The Will... but, all I need is to get rid of those pesky ghosts!' Adam frowned as he swung his hand.</p><br><p>This time, the ghosts acted more cautiously and defended themselves with their scythes, blocking the ghost needle. Moreover, gradually, the needle diverged into transparent threads, showing that Krana and Trana's auras still surpassed his own.</p><br><p>However, Adam had solved the main problem, and now he didn't have to worry about enemy auras tearing him from the inside since he had a loyal protector as well!</p><br><p>"Sister!" Trana exclaimed anxiously, "What should we do?!"</p><br><p>Krana quickly glanced at the ghosts, at the ghostly needle, and then at Adam, who was running straight at them, not planning to stop.</p><br><p>"Tsk. We have no choice but to keep fighting him. From the looks of it, he has very little energy left. Creating an Aura Seal and using The Will for the first time takes a terrifying amount of power. The fact that he's still conscious and on his feet is a miracle!" Krana said before rushing into battle, loosening the control of her aura.</p><br><p>Trana immediately followed her.</p><br><p>They had mastered The Will and created the Aura Seal at the exact moment during their long training. Back then, they couldn't even summon their aura since they had blacked out for more than ten hours, and when they woke up, they felt weak and exhausted.</p><br><p>Soon, their auras would exhaust each other, however, it no longer mattered as much as before. The two aura users didn't fight using only their auras, it was only a part of their power, and thanks to the difference in might the fight could be over quickly.</p><br><p>For example, Prago only needed to use his The Will to defeat Adam, he didn't even need to move or attack. Roughly speaking, The Will allowed Phantom to defeat weaker opponents with little to no energy and abilities.</p><br><br><p>Adam held his needle tightly, keeping a close eye on Krana and Trana, who were moving quickly towards him. Their feet touched the ground simultaneously, achieving full synchronization and acting as one mechanism.</p><br><p>Krana and Trana had already used their abilities, The Will, and even the artifact trait, but they had something else in their arsenal, their Nexuses.</p><br><p>"Let's go! We can win!" Trana exclaimed as her eyes shone brightly and the blade of her scythe trembled.</p><br><br><p>Then, they stopped and slammed the scythes against each other, causing a powerful shockwave, and making the energy barrier shake.</p><br><br><p>Trana and Krana began to rapidly swing their scythes as if preparing for a powerful attack, however... In fact, they had already attacked.</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" Someone muttered, looking at the wind blades hovering in the air in front of Krana and Trana.</p><br><p>After each swing by scythe, two to four wind blades remained in the air. They were actively vibrating, sending shivers outwards.</p><br><p>Indeed, in any other situation, Krana and Trana wouldn't hold the blades in the air - it was unnecessary, as they could immediately release them, bringing down on their enemy. MVLeMpYr-official-text</p><br><p>But, Adam had no room or time to maneuver. His only option for victory was to go straight ahead and knock out his opponents. Naturally, Krana and Trana understood this.</p><br><p>"Sister... I can't take it anymore..." Trana muttered, falling to one knee. Cumulatively, she had already created over fifty Wind Blades and that was her maximum.</p><br><p>Krana nodded, stopping. She, too, was running low on energy.</p><br><p>"This is enough. If he can withstand even that, then... he deserves this victory. We did everything we could." Krana sighed heavily, reaching forward and launching all of her wind blades at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils narrowed as he abruptly stopped throwing his left arm forward.</p><br><p>In the few seconds it took Krana and Trana to prepare an attack, Adam had already realized what they were going to do and figured out how he could respond to it.</p><br><p>Adam could only make one powerful attack in his current state, and his choice was simple as silver threads quickly cascaded around his left arm.</p><br><p>As Adam moved his hands, the threads transformed into a dense gauntlet with claw-like, sharp fingertips.</p><br><p>"There are many blades, but I can cut them all!" Adam shouted, waving his claws from bottom to top as if wanting to cause a shockwave.</p><br><p>At the same moment, five silver threads came out, finding themselves against each other so tightly that it was practically a shield.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Without resistance, the silver threads shattered the wind blades, but only the center part, the rest were aimed at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils narrowed as he abruptly turned his body, allowing the blades to sweep behind his back and in front of his chest, only a few centimeters from his body.</p><br><p>Powerful wind currents fluttered his hair, while the tips rippled before his azure eyes.</p><br><br><p>Krana and Trana jumped away from the silver blades before they slammed into the wall, cutting it several meters deep.</p><br><p>If Fall Hill Prison was not underground but amid the city streets, this attack would have caused severe destruction and even civilian casualties.</p><br><p>"No... it can't be..." Trana muttered in disbelief, looking at the destruction.</p><br><br><p>A tall silhouette appeared in front of her, electric shocks whizzing around its feet.</p><br><p>Trana's eyes went wide as Adam grabbed her and threw her to the other side of the arena - right into her sister, causing the twins to collide with each other at high speed.</p><br><p>Adam made several leaps, finding himself right before Trana and Krana.</p><br><p>He raised his needle high, about to unleash the deadly weapon on his opponents.</p><br><p>"Bastard...!" Trana muttered with her last strength, pulling her arm forward.</p><br><p>Before the irreversible had a chance to happen, Krana carefully hugged Trana, lowering her arm and moving forward - putting her back up to the strike, but protecting her little sister.</p><br><br><p>Adam fell back on the floor like a statue, since his hand was still raised, but no longer clutching anything as the needle dissipated.</p><br><p>Smiling bitterly, Adam closed his eyes - sinking into darkness.</p>
