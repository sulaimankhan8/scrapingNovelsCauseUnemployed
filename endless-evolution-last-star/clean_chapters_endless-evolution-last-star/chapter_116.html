            <br><p>Globally, the Phantoms had many different worldviews, some believing in equality between humans and Phantoms like Azure Lotus or something more radical like Crimson Path.</p><br><p>Still, the Phantoms could not resist their nature despite their ideology. Logic and politics were one side, but inner desires were quite another.</p><br><p>Things varied from Phantom to Phantom, but many of the stronger Phantoms often experienced the pure pleasure of fighting monsters.</p><br><p>True, every fight with a monster was dangerous and could lead to death, especially against strong monsters. However, the Phantoms had two solid reasons to feel pleasure in seemingly dangerous situations, even if they were drenched in blood and badly wounded, and any mistake could lead to their death.</p><br><p>In defeating monsters, the Phantoms felt the same joy that ordinary people felt when they achieved some success, whether it was a project at work, a relationship, or a successfully passed exam.</p><br><p>The second reason was the Phantoms' hunter's side, the longer they fought, the more they got the taste for it.</p><br><p>It seemed that this effect could grow to infinite heights, with every monster killed and blood spilled, making them want to fight an even stronger opponent.</p><br><p>Thus, as long as Phantom had strength, he could fight with an excited smile on his face, and Resonance was especially affected by it - leaving only one thing in Phantom's mind: his next target.</p><br><br><p>Without thinking of anything but the dangerous monster, Adam lunged forward, bringing his needle down directly on North Keeper.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, North Keeper bounced aside, missing the silver needle right in front of him.</p><br><p>However, in no time, Adam attacked once more, acting at the limit of his power. The tip of his needle was rapidly approaching North Keeper's head.</p><br><p>North Keeper's pupils narrowed as he reached out, pulling towards him a random K0-Phantom that ran past them, trying to get as far away as possible.</p><br><p>The speed was too much for Adam to react in time, ending up with his needle deeply entering Phantom's shoulder, slicing through flesh and bone.</p><br><p>"ARGGHHHHHH!!!" The young man cried out in pain, bright waves of agony spread throughout his body.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide with the realization of what he had just done. K0-Phantom, who had recently been a mere youth, was now screaming in pain because of his needle, his attack.</p><br><br><p>Adam grabbed the young man's arm and sharply tossed him aside, hitting the other Phantoms, who continued to move forward without stopping.</p><br><p>"Away! Get out of my way if you don't want to get hit!" Adam shouted before abruptly turning around and kicking North Keeper.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, North Keeper put up a block, crossing his blades and greatly reducing the power of Adam's kick. However, the impact, threw him back a few meters, sending him into midair.</p><br><p>Adam immediately followed him.</p><br><p>If this situation had happened a few missions ago, Adam would most likely have been paralyzed for a while by the fact that he had injured another person. North Keeper would have definitely taken advantage of this weakness to wound or even kill him.</p><br><p>However, now, Adam had enough experience and cold blood to realize that he shouldn't regret what he had done.</p><br><p>For every second that he would hesitate before attacking North Keeper, the monster would kill one Phantom. Thus, one wounded K0-Phantom was an insignificant cost.</p><br><p>However, Adam was not only acting from the logical side. His main goal was to kill North Keeper, not to save the Phantoms, so... right now, his priorities were clear and indestructible.</p><br><br><p>Adam quickly ran towards North Keeper, intending to strike as well as the monster. A sharp glint ran across North Keeper's ice blades exuding menace, and his eyes narrowed. It seemed that North Keeper was ready to cut Adam into four pieces with his next attack.</p><br><p>There were still a few seconds before Adam reached North Keeper, but... North Keeper felt a powerful chill run down his back before Adam even got close to him.</p><br><p>Then, North Keeper sharply turned around only to meet Alexia's eyes. Her fist was already raised to attack, she was exhaling cold vapor, and her skin was slightly blue with glowing hair.</p><br><p>Adam had thrown her aside, but now... with her veins swollen and bloodshot eyes, Alexia was ready to fight, since she entered Resonance!</p><br><p>She was eager to fight, and her genes responded to her will, allowing her to become as strong as possible.</p><br><br><p>Alexia's fist came down on North Keeper's jaw, with such force that Frost Beast's head would surely explode.</p><br><br><p>North Keeper flew dozens of meters, smashing into ice crystals and eventually ending up in a massive drift of snow, raising a high wave as if from an explosion.</p><br><p>Adam and Alexia stopped for a moment. They looked at each other and smiled slightly.</p><br><p>They gazed at each other closely, focusing their attention on eyes, hair, mouths, necks, and breasts as well as the breathing that soon they began to share.</p><br><p>It seemed that even their hearts began to beat the same to maximize synergy. Their genes were in the same state, for the same purpose, and so now they had one path.</p><br><p>Adam was about to say something, but... before he could utter a sound, a blue flash flew out of the snowdrift, instantly reaching their level.</p><br><p>Adam and Alexia's eyes went wide as North Keeper's arms reached out to them.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, North Keeper grabbed them firmly by their heads, pushing their foreheads against each other with tremendous force.</p><br><p>A cracking sound like breaking bones spread around, causing Adam and Alexia to lose consciousness for a moment.</p><br><p>"Bastard!" Alexia exclaimed, taking North Keeper by the arm and pulling it sharply.</p><br><p>Adam reacted quickly, realizing what Alexia was about to do, and grabbed North Keeper's other arm.</p><br><p>They pulled the monster's arms in different directions with all their strength. Perhaps neither Adam nor Alexia could use their abilities anymore, especially Nexus, but, it didn't affect their physical power. They were tired, but the effects of Resonance were enough to make them forget about the exhaustion from the past fights for a while.</p><br><p>North Keeper's pupils narrowed as his flesh began to tear and even bleed. A few more seconds, and he might actually be left without two arms after underestimating his opponents.</p><br><p>Well... In fact, it was still a big question of who was underestimating whom.</p><br><br><p>North Keeper took a step forward, clenching his fists tightly and using all his strength to force his hands into motion. Even though Alexia and Adam held them tightly, it didn't stop North Keeper.</p><br><p>Then, North Keeper's palms collided with each other, as well as Adam with Alexia.</p><br><p>Following, North Keeper swung his arms, tossing Adam and Alexia aside - straight towards the sharp crystals in the distance.</p><br><p>Owen, watching the fight, frowned, as he cast a glance at his shield.</p><br><p>'Tsk. Somehow, I had a feeling from the start that I would need it. Good thing I trusted my intuition.' Owen muttered internally as his eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>His shield trembled slightly, about to be filled with powerful energy - all to help Adam and Alexia win their last battle in this Eclipse!</p>
