            <br><p>Neither Franz, Rosalind, nor Adam suspected that Gladius had been watching them all this time, though that wasn't the right word.</p><br><p>He didn't care what they were doing, since he came here as a spectator, to watch Adam break his First Wall.</p><br><p>He'd hoped to see something interesting, and he wasn't wrong.</p><br><br><p>The last handful of popcorn disappeared into Gladius's mouth as he jumped down from the tree.</p><br><p>"Well, it's always a good idea to take out the trash, isn't it? You shouldn't pollute nature, or I wouldn't be able to enjoy this show in peace." Gladius uttered, picked up the empty popcorn bucket, and disappeared into the darkness.</p><br><p>Despite Gladius staring directly at them for an extended period, Franz or Rosalind couldn't sense that something was wrong. The difference in their strength was too great for their instincts to allow them to spot Gladius.</p><br><br><p>Adam approached Franz, Silvana, and Rosalind.</p><br><p>"So, who do you have to fight?" Franz asked with a sly smile on his face.</p><br><p>Adam scratched his cheek in embarrassment.</p><br><p>"Well... I've decided that I don't want to know yet. You see, I have The Rule of Power ahead, so there's no point in worrying about anything else, yet."</p><br><p>Franz's eyes went wide for a moment, he didn't expect such a decision from Adam, but soon he nodded deeply.</p><br><p>Rosalind did likewise with a hard stare.</p><br><p>"It's unusual, but I'm sure it's the right decision." Rosalind said in a serious voice, "I guess we won't bother you anymore, will we?"</p><br><p>Franz shrugged, the corners of his lips going up.</p><br><p>"Yeah, we've resolved all the issues. Adam, make sure you get a good rest tomorrow. I don't know if you're hoping for an easy fight or a hard one, but it won't be simple to win in The Rule of Power."</p><br><p>Adam turned, looking up at the night sky, the stars reflected in his bright blue eyes.</p><br><p>"Sure. If it's going to be easier than the battle against the Plague Reaper, then I'll be disappointed and even angry..."</p><br><p>Franz and Rosalind got strange expressions but decided not to say anything.</p><br><br><p>That night, for the first time in a long three months, Gray Castle was empty, not completely, but none of its guests were there anymore.</p><br><p>Tron, Riska, and Dahla left the Gray Castle a few days ago, and so did Max after his last fight against Adam.</p><br><p>Silvana and Adam could have returned to the Gray Castle for another one, but neither of them did.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Silvana went back to her house alone, not that Adam should go with her, but she could see that he wasn't going home, not on this night.</p><br><br><p>Silvana closed her door, looking through the window at the departing Adam, the car bringing them here passed next to him.</p><br><p>"I wonder where he's going? He could go straight home, but he didn't. Moreover, his house is in the other direction..."</p><br><p>Silvana's curiosity was strong, but she realized that this was Adam's personal business and even if she decided to follow him, she just wouldn't catch up with him.</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head, headed to the kitchen, and made an espresso, using one of the bags of coffee that Adam had gifted her earlier.</p><br><p>As she took the first sip, her gaze fell on her bracelet, another, more substantial gift from Adam.</p><br><p>Slowly, Silvana's gaze grew deeper filling with sorrow.</p><br><p>'Shit... Can you really call me a good Operator? Adam helps me all the time and already gave me two gifts without receiving anything from me in return...'</p><br><p>Taking another sip, Silvana raised her right hand, examining the bracelet under the dim light from the lamp.</p><br><p>'Well, when I was first in the academy I thought I would be strict and in control of my Phantom, work-wise... But it seems I'm not strong enough to be number one and... there's nothing wrong with that.'</p><br><p>Silvana smiled contentedly before taking another taste of the rich coffee flavor.</p><br><p>Then, her expression changed abruptly as she frowned.</p><br><p>"Tsk. I have to gift him something or else I'll be reminded of it every time!"</p><br><br><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p><br><p>The young girl knocked on the door before entering, carrying a table with many drinks. She was going to fill the minibar that happened every morning in this hotel.</p><br><p>Inside she saw a young man who was still asleep, the blanket almost completely covering him, leaving only his head, his black hair, and closed eyes visible.</p><br><p>'What? Is he still asleep? It'll be lunchtime soon... and he hasn't put the sign on the doorknob. Well, I'll be back later then.' The girl pondered before tugging on the table, about to leave.</p><br><p>Rumble. Rumble. Rumble.</p><br><p>Her movements made the bottles on the bottom row of the table shake, hitting each other.</p><br><p>It was enough to make Adam open his blue eyes.</p><br><p>When the girl saw this she was embarrassed and bowed low.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry for waking you up! I'll leave now!"</p><br><p>In response, she heard only one thing.</p><br><p>"Do you have any sodas?"</p><br><br><br><p>A mountain of spaghetti fell onto the plate, along with some well-seasoned meat. Then, shrimp, a little veggies, and meat again.</p><br><p>Adam scooped up his food from the hotel buffet, not shy about portion size.</p><br><p>He sat at the far end of the room, at a lone table by the window with a panoramic view of the center of the eighth wing from the 30th floor.</p><br><p>"Yeah... It's nice here."</p><br><p>Adam nodded continuing to eat and looking out at the gorgeous view outside the window, at the hundreds of people and dozens of cars moving through the streets of the Citadel's center.</p><br><p>"If I were an ordinary person, I would dream of being here. If you have enough money you can live like this every day, there's always food, service, and a beautiful view."</p><br><br><p>Putting his fork and knife aside, Adam looked around at the other visitors to this luxurious hotel. Explore more at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"But I'm no ordinary person, I'm the Phantom."</p><br><p>Adam muttered as his voice got lower.</p><br><p>"And... I'm getting tired of waiting for the real fight."</p><br><p>His fingertips trembled and his gaze grew darker with the appearance of a devious smirk.</p><br><p>Some people sitting not far from him had a chill run down their backs, they shuddered without knowing the reason.</p><br><p>"Osana, where did you get me into? Although, right now I'm thankful that I only have a few hours to wait."</p>
