            <br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Climbing up the icy slope, a massive shadow gradually appeared, causing even the massive wolves to step aside.</p><br><p>This creature was not their leader, but, the wolves could feel nothing but respect and awe for such a strong and ferocious creature. Like any monsters - they placed absolute power above all else. Everything rest was insignificant in front of pure might.</p><br><p>The phantoms trembled, naturally out of fear, even though the monster had not yet appeared, its aura was all-consuming and terrifying.</p><br><p>However... for a certain one, there were goosebumps of anticipation and even joy, for the expectations had finally paid off.</p><br><p>"Come on. Don't make me wait any longer..." Alexia said in an interrupted voice, rarely breathing.</p><br><p>Soon, the light fell on a massive shadow, revealing long horns pointing backwards along the broad head, rising up at the very end like deadly spears.</p><br><p>Then, two blue eyes with vertical pupils cast their gaze across the battlefield, slightly revealing its wide jaw with massive teeth and six long fangs.</p><br><p>The monster stepped forward, exposing its four massive paws with short but strong claws and a large, muscular body with a thick hide. The monster had no protective scales or dense fur, not even a laser blade could damage its hide, only scratch it, that wasn't a guarantee.</p><br><p>A fat tail with bone rings swung slowly from side to side with a large spiked sphere at the end, which, like a hammer, could come down on someone's head, easily blowing it up.</p><br><p>"Who the hell is that...?" Adam muttered, his fingertips trembling and his pupils dilated.</p><br><p>'That's bad...' Silvana sighed heavily, 'It's a Frost Beast, Purple Threat Level, Red Book, still... That's not all you need to know about this monster.'</p><br><p>"What, what are you talking about? Isn't that already enough?" Adam was puzzled. He didn't realize what could be worse than a Purple Threat Level, Red Book, monster. This was the peak of power.</p><br><p>Silvana said after a short pause:</p><br><p>'As you know, even amongst the same Threat Level, the strength of monsters can differ dramatically. Nothing is surprising about that, but in some cases, it can be critical. Starting at the Blue Threat Level, esspecially strong monsters have their own Rating. The higher the monster is in the Rating, the stronger it is. It's as simple as that.'</p><br><br><p>'I see... It's not hard to guess where you're going with this. Frost Beast is ranked quite high, isn't it?"</p><br><p>'Unfortunately, you're right. According to the mission department, Frost Beast is 6th Rank among all Purple Threat Level monsters. In other words, there are only five monsters stronger than him, Frost Beast is almost at the peak.'' Silvana explained in a serious voice.</p><br><p>Adam nodded as he shifted his gaze to the wolves that slowly approached them, while Frost Beast stood still, waiting for his opponent to show itself.</p><br><p>The strongest was only supposed to fight the same - the strongest.</p><br><p>"What about that one? I hope that wolf isn't in the Top 10?" Adam asked, pointing at one of the four massive wolves. He wasn't interested in the other monsters, he had already picked his target, and it seemed that the monster was already set to accept his challenge.</p><br><p>'Azure Wolf, the one you're looking at is a Prime Type. Purple Threat Level, Red Book. They're quite strong, but compared to the Frost Beast, they don't seem that dangerous.' Silvana quickly replied.</p><br><br><p>"Alright, it's time for me to get to work, isn't it?" Adam uttered, stepping aside.</p><br><p>At the same time, dozens of different monsters ran forward at Left North Squad. Snow Imots and Horned Lizards were soon right in front of Adam, but, he didn't even look at them.</p><br><p>That was not a mistake, for the monsters just rushed past him, moreover, they avoided him, not wanting to confront him because they knew it was not their level. A similar thing was happening to the other captains, especially Alexia. </p><br><p>For dozens of meters around her, there wasn't a single monster. They were afraid of her like the plague, unwilling to give their lives for nothing. The monsters knew that Alexia would kill them in a heartbeat.</p><br><p>Adam would have liked to defeat the strongest monster like he usually did, but he wasn't stupid and wasn't going to let arrogance ruin him. He realized that he probably didn't stand a chance against Frost Beast, and even if he did... he wasn't the most worthy opponent.</p><br><p>If he wanted to fight the strongest monster, he had to be the strongest in the squad. It was simple.</p><br><br><p>Prime Azure World furiously growled, slowly walking around Adam, staring at him intently as if he were his victim.</p><br><p>"Hey, this is the last wave, right?"</p><br><p>'Yes. There's not much time left before dawn, or rather... not enough time for another such wave to appear. However, that doesn't mean you need to delay. There's still plenty of time for the monsters to kill every Phantom if you don't defend yourself.' Silvana said seriously.</p><br><br><p>"Good. So I can finally not hold back. Well, in that case, let's start with simple." Adam stretched his hand forward, electric shocks running through his fingertips.</p><br><p>Before Azure Wolf could realize anything, Adam clenched his fist, unleashing a mighty thunderbolt as fast as sound and as hot as plasma on the monster.</p><br><p>Azure Wolf had no time to dodge, Adam did everything quickly, much faster than against the Steel Knight when he just got the Third Artifact Trait.</p><br><p>Practice only gave Adam a few milliseconds of advantage, but it was enough to give Azure Wolf time for one action: a swish of his tail.</p><br><p>Whoooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>The sharp tip of the tail slammed into the thunderbolt, quickly absorbing all the energy and channeling it along the crystal ridge running along Azure Wolf's spine.</p><br><p>The blue crystals glowed brightly, seemingly ready to explode at any moment, but somehow they managed to resist the pressure and save Azure Wolf from taking any damage.</p><br><p>Then, Azure Wolf's eyes shone brightly as well as the depths of its maw, as if like a dragon before it would burst out its destructive fiery breath.</p><br><p>"Oh... That was unexpected..." Adam muttered with a stunned face when the electric shocks went through his legs.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam turned into a lightning flash, at the last second dodging the devastating laser that partly used his energy.</p><br><p>"Dodge!!!" Phantom exclaimed, only to see the laser rip through his mate's body, then ending his life as well.</p><br><p>Though Azure Wolf used the energy from Adam's thunderbolt, it was only enough for a few seconds of the laser.</p><br><p>Well... It was too much, for many on this brutal battlefield.</p><br><p>The laser turned into nothing, dozens of Phantoms and monsters that happened to be under an attack that wasn't intended for them. It was impossible to defend themselves, for many of them had not even realized what had happened yet, they were already dead.</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" The girl whispered while trickles of blood flowed from the corners of her mouth. She lowered her gaze, seeing the wide hole in her chest, organs spilling outward, quickly plunging her into eternal darkness.</p><br><p>Adam, standing in the distance, with waves of shivers running through his body stared at the bloody trail left by the laser.</p><br><p>Sweat broke out, and a chill ran down his spine as he realized he was as much or even more responsible for their deaths than Azure Wolf.</p>
