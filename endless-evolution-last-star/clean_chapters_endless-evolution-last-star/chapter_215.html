            <br><p>Dark Tyrant's body was covered in solid granite armor that seemed built to withstand any attack, even the most powerful.</p><br><p>Dense lightning energy spread throughout his body, allowing him to look down on everyone, not only because of his impressive height and size but because of his great strength.</p><br><p>Slowly, Dark Tyrant stretched out his arms with open palms, pointing them at Thunder Demon, who was thirty meters away. However, given Dark Tyrant's size, it was the equivalent of several large steps.</p><br><p>In front of Dark Tyrant appeared a massive electric ring with three circles inside it, one large and two much smaller ones on the sides of the main one.</p><br><p>Obviously, Dark Tyrant was preparing a powerful attack, and Thunder Demon should either dodge or do the same, but he just watched his enemy's actions with interest. It was all fun and entertainment for him.</p><br><p>But... sometimes arrogance and overconfidence could bring down even the strongest and most capable. Thunder Demon was no exception to that rule.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Dark Tyrant's entire body sparkled, and its two heads opened their mouths wide, creating huge spheres filled with lightning energy.</p><br><p>Then, after a few seconds, the spheres stopped growing, releasing their full power outward in the form of blue, electric beams. They hit the two side circles, merging into one in the larger circle, becoming a weapon capable of destroying an entire hill if desired.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Thunder Demon grinned and raised his head high, pointing his long horns towards the sky.</p><br><p>At his will, lightning bolts headed towards his horns, even if the anomalies were against it, not wanting to lose their energy, they could do nothing about it because Thunder Demon's power was too great.</p><br><p>So Thunder Demon used the anomalies around him to infuse his horns with the power of lightning. He couldn't keep the electricity in his horns for long, but he didn't need to.</p><br><br><p>A second before the beam of the Dark Tyrant was about to reach its target, Thunder Demon attacked.</p><br><p>All the energy from his horns came out in an instant, forming a thin, dense laser, something like the one he had used to destroy the centipedes, but that one was clearly brighter and faster, aimed at a single target like a sniper shot rather than a stream from a flamethrower - long, but not very destructive.</p><br><p>With a whistle of the wind, the laser swept through Dark Tyrant's beam, easily dispersing it into streams of blue flame that in an instant lost all their power.</p><br><p>Then, the laser crashed into Dark Tyrant's chest, gradually burning through Dark Tyrant's armor.</p><br><p>If Dark Tyrant had been a little sturdier or had an extra layer of protection, perhaps Thunder Demon's attack wouldn't have had such an effect, but... soon the armor turned red and melted.</p><br><p>The laser pierced through Dark Tyrant's armor and caused the huge monster's entire body to crack trying to absorb the energy from the laser. This was Dark Tyrant's last chance to stay alive, all he had to do was hold on for at least a few more seconds.</p><br><p>Adam watched the scene intently, unable to look away as if he were watching a battle that could change his entire life. Never before had he seen such pure destructive power and savagery, especially in a battle between monsters.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Dark Tyrant's body shuddered before exploding under the Thunder Demon's laser.</p><br><p>A huge monster no bigger than a five-story building was simply blown apart by a single attack from a creature many times smaller.</p><br><p>Massive chunks of flesh, along with pieces of armor, flew off to the sides, covering the salty lands with dark blood, only to be soon forgotten and become one of the hundreds of hills due to the wind currents that would carefully cover them with layers of salt.</p><br><br><p>The Dark Tyrant's head crashed into the ruins, not far from Adam and Fred.</p><br><p>They could see the lifeless look of a monster that could have been a threat to most K1-Phantoms. Now, it was just a piece of rapidly cooling flesh with a layer of stone armor.</p><br><p>Then, Adam turned around, looking at Thunder Demon. He couldn't believe that after such an attack, Thunder Demon was able to actively fight anymore.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes sparkled as a satisfied smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>'Fine, now I see that you are not invincible. Even the strongest have to have their weaknesses and limitations, don't they?' Adam pondered staring at Thunder Demon, whose breathing had become heavy and intermittent.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon lowered his head as if trying to recover and regain his strength. At that moment a plan of action was beginning to emerge in Adam's mind. He knew he had to seize this moment if he wanted to win, but... Fred didn't feel the same way.</p><br><p>'Adam, don't even think about it. You're fooling yourself.' Silvana said sternly, guessing from Adam's smile what he wanted to do.</p><br><p>"What? Why?! He's at maximum vulnerability right now!" Adam exclaimed with a wave of his hand, "If I spent as much energy as he does, I'd be a mummy by now! His out-of-breath is the best we can hope for!"</p><br><br><p>'Sure. You're right, about everything, but you just don't understand something. Thunder Demon isn't just strong, he's smart. He realizes that this place is like a personal nuclear reactor with infinite energy, all he has to do is eat a new uranium capsule and restore his reserves.'</p><br><p>Silvana continued, while Adam tried to understand what she was talking about. Her example was quite difficult for him to comprehend.</p><br><p>'If the radiation from uranium is destructive to humans, then for a monster, it will only be a source of energy. This is just an example, various monsters have different resistance to radiation, but you'll soon realize what I'm trying to tell you. Just watch.' Silvana said calmly as if she knew what Thunder Demon was about to do.</p><br><p>But Silvana wasn't the only one, Fred stared at Thunder Demon, not intending to do anything, because he knew it was useless.</p><br><br><p>Taking a few more breaths, Thunder Demon dashed away, but not towards the Phantoms or monsters, no, he was taking a short break from fighting. He had a more important task than another blood rampage.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide when Thunder Demon stopped next to one of the dozens of anomalies.</p><br><p>It wasn't one of the three main anomalies, as there was only a Zero Rarity Level Artifact here. Naturally, with a lightning attribute.</p><br><p>The artifact looked like a round stone with several blue crystals showing outwards, electric discharges occasionally emanating from them.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon licked his teeth with obvious anticipation in his gaze before grabbing the artifact.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The artifact shuddered, unwilling to leave its home, dozens of heavy lightnings, like chains, tried to keep the artifact on the ground, but Thunder Demon wasn't going to give up.</p><br><br><p>Thunder Demon ripped the artifact out of the ground with a sharp movement, looked at it with an appetite as if it were a gourmet dish, and opened his mouth wide and devoured it.</p><br><p>There was a loud crunch, while Thunder Demon's teeth broke the artifact into small pieces before swallowing it whole.</p><br><p>Then, Thunder Demon's eyes shone brightly, and electricity came out of his body, spreading in all directions.</p>
