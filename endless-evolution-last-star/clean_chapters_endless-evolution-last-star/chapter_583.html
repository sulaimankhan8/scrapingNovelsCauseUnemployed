            <br><br><p>In a way, these two weapons were opposites. Sure, unlike Adam’s past First Order, his needle was more like a sword, it could make slashing attacks instead of just stabbing or trying to cut something with only the tip. Your next chapter is on Freewebnovel
</p><br><p>If the hammer didn’t have a sharp end, then only crushing attacks were possible with this weapon, stabbing and slashing ones were impossible.
</p><br><p>This meant that a fighter fighting with a hammer could not cut through the flesh of the enemy or pierce its armor, but... was that necessary?
</p><br><p>One precise hit from a weapon that even a K2-Phantom as strong as Fromund could barely lift was more than enough to crush a monster’s armor or tough scales.
</p><br><p>The force of the strike would simply break a man’s bones, turning his internal organs into a bloody mess even if the armor remained intact.
</p><br><p>However, hammers like any other weapon of a similar type had one major disadvantage: speed.
</p><br><p>No matter how strong Fromund was, if he had some sort of sword or light blade in his hands, he could attack much faster.
</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, holding his needle tightly. He didn’t know what Fromund would be capable of, so it was a wise decision on his part not to use many abilities at once.
</p><br><p>’Hmm... I could bombard him with filaments with electricity and top it all off with two sound waves from Nexus, then try to finish him off with a gravity strike, but...’
</p><br><p>His sharp gaze fixed on Fromund.
</p><br><p>’If he can continue the fight after my barrage of attacks, then I simply won’t have anything I can respond with.’
</p><br><br><p>With each of Fromund’s steps, the ground shook slightly, raising short waves of dust. It was all about his hammer that was pressing down on his right shoulder, the heaviness of his weapon was obvious to every spectator - one of his shoulders was higher and the other lower.
</p><br><p>"You know... You said you don’t know why your Nexus is so heavy, but... even before K2-Level, the Nexus is built according to your preferences. Once you reach K2-Level, the Nexus becomes the perfect weapon, armor, or whatever - as long as its form fits the Phantom."
</p><br><p>Stopping, Fromund raised an eyebrow, giving Adam a questioning look.
</p><br><p>"Why are you saying that now? Are you trying to confuse me?"
</p><br><p>He received Adam’s stern stare in response, his hand raised, pointing the sharp tip of the needle at his opponent.
</p><br><p>"That means your weapon has to be perfect for you. There’s no other choice, and... even if it’s actually heavy for you, it has some secret."
</p><br><br><p>For a while, Fromund said nothing, he gazed at Adam with wide-open eyes, surprise read in his look.
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Fromund chuckled briefly.
</p><br><p>"Well, believe it or not, I’m not comfortable, but you’re right. My Nexus has a secret."
</p><br><p>Then, Fromund took a deep breath and grabbed his hammer with both hands.
</p><br><p>"I think that’s enough talking for now. You’ve already learned a lot about me."
</p><br><p>Realizing that Fromund was right, Adam nodded deeply, yet he couldn’t help but ask one more question: "Your motives. What are you fighting for?"
</p><br><p>Fromund cast a sidelong glance, causing Adam to turn his head toward Kogen’s box.
</p><br><p>"The two girls in the red chairs and another one standing at the very edge. Those are my three little sisters. And... they’re my only family."
</p><br><p>Not waiting for Adam’s response, not wanting to see his reaction, Fromund rushed forward leaping high despite the monstrous weight of his hammer.
</p><br><p>A bright flash swept across his blue eyes, causing them to turn into two red stars for a moment.
</p><br><p>The energy traveled down his arms, quickly turning into flames that in a heartbeat consumed the hammer head.
</p><br><p>Adam cautiously took a few steps back, looking at Fromund, at the burning hammer that was ready to descend on him like the morning star.
</p><br><p>Even the first rays of sunlight seemed eager to join the fiery warrior on his path to victory.
</p><br><p>’The fire ran through his hands, so it’s not his Nexus... It’s one of his Orders. Fine, this is one of the abilities I expected to see after his Spirit.’
</p><br><p>To win you needed to study your opponent properly, Adam understood that as well as the fact that he wasn’t going to lose from the first attack.
</p><br><p>Why hadn’t Silvana informed him of Fromund’s abilities? After all, she was the Operator and it was her job to search for information. She had an hour to do so.
</p><br><p>Well... she tried, it wasn’t forbidden by the rules. But, someone, a more powerful Operator familiar with the situation blocked her access. And, Arayna found herself in the same situation.
</p><br><br><p>Bursting through the torrents of wind, raising the air temperature to a critical level when the few drops of sweat on Fromund’s forehead instantly turned to steam, he neared Adam.
</p><br><br><p>A lone but correct thought filled Adam’s mind, his feet leaped off the ground, moving his body away from the most dangerous place in this empty arena.
</p><br><br><p>Tilda blinked as the flaming hammer crashed to the ground.
</p><br><p>Thick cracks ripped the surface like a massive earthquake, chunks of earth surging upwards with the ensuing shudder.
</p><br><p>The entire arena trembled, the vibrations traveled through the spectator seats sending chills down the backs of ordinary people.
</p><br><p>The pillar of flame illuminated the massive structure with its bright light, heading upwards towards the heavens.
</p><br><p>Any stone caught in the scarlet flames disappeared like a nameless shadow, burning to the ground.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>A second wave erupted from the bottom of the pillar, in a massive explosion destroying everything in its path, the pure force ripping the stones from the ground turning them into fiery meteors flying in all directions at dangerous speed, leaving a trail of flame behind.
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes narrowed as his hands came into motion destroying several rocks with precise sweeps.
</p><br><p>No matter how hot the stones were, a single cut by the needle was enough to wipe out their power.
</p><br><p>’Oh, now I realize that we are very different. It’s not just the fact that he uses a hammer. It’s all about the type of attacks he performs. I’m not capable of creating something so devastating, but for him, it’s a simple attack.’
</p><br><br><p>With the back of his palm, Adam kicked away a random rock, a trickle of smoke drifting away from his skin.
</p><br><p>’I see... We’re so similar, yet we’re so different... It’s a shame he’s going to lose, as that outcome is unacceptable to me.’
</p><br><p>Adam thought, gripping his needle tighter.
</p><br><p>Anyone who saw Adam fight would realize that he had a plan, simple, effective, and brutal.
</p><br><p>Silvana smiled contentedly, for her to notice this was an easy task, she knew her Phantom well.
</p><br><p>And... standing beside her Arayna could sense it too.
</p><br><p>’Fromund... On missions, you always destroy dozens of monsters in a few attacks, but... Adam isn’t the kind of opponent you can defeat with a mass attack.’ Arayna bit her lip, her face frowning.
</p><br><br><p>The transparent walls of the arena barrier trembled, blue glare appearing to block the incoming flames and meteorites time after time.
</p><br><p>The spectators couldn’t figure out where to look, some watched the top of the pillar that was as bright and active as an erupting volcano, and others watched the shadow in the center - the only one that could be in this heat because it was its cause.
</p><br><br><p>A hot cloud of vapor came out of Fromund’s mouth, if it were the lips of a normal person they would burn in seconds. But, Fromund himself felt nothing. Such a flame that could easily harm Light Yellow monsters, burn their flesh and bones, wasn’t even warm to Fromund like cooled tea.
</p><br><p>Then, he felt something closer to cold than to his usual warmth.
</p><br><p>’He dodged, but the fire and stones should have caught him. If I managed to do that, it made it in time.’ Fromund thought, feeling the hilt of his hammer shudder.
</p><br><p>’Heh... already? No, it’s too early. I don’t think it would be the right decision to rush in like this...’
</p><br><p>The flames slowly settled, the energy of the explosion was quickly running out but Fromund still had a few seconds to think about his next actions.
</p><br><br><p>The silver blade entered the flame stream, cutting through the scarlet waves with a quick swing.
</p><br><p>Fromund raised his head sharply, meeting Adam’s cold gaze on the other side of the wall of fire.
</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam’s hand protected by his Nexus went inside the vortex, soon his entire body passed through the barrier.
</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Fromund’s body, his eyes darting downward as his muscles tensed in an attempt to quickly pull out his hammer that was stuck in the molten rock.
</p><br><br><p>A sincere, quiet voice like a ghost’s whisper reached Fromund’s ears.
</p><br><br><p>Adam gripped Fromund tightly by the neck, not intending to let go of his opponent under any circumstances.
</p><br><p>Fromund instinctively tried to pull away from Adam, to loosen his grip, but it proved to be an impossible task.
</p><br><p>Normally Fromund would have been able to do so, but Adam’s hand was protected by his Nexus and he towered over him.
</p><br><br><p>A silver flash reflected in Fromund’s eyes, followed by a surge of saturated blood, the first drops glistening, reflecting the fiery flashes like rubies.
</p><br><p>Bright pain spread from Fromund’s chest, crimson trickles flowed from the wide diagonal cut on his chest.
</p><br><p>Adam raised his arm high, about to end the fight with his next attack.
</p><br><p>"Looks like I’ll be granting Osana’s wish soon."
</p><br><p>Fromund’s eyes went wide and his heart started beating faster, faster and faster... his heart was beating too fast.
</p><br><br><p>Then, towards the end of the flame swirl, a shadow flew outward with a rumble crashing into the wall.
</p><br><p>A cloud of dust rose, but it only partially obscured the silhouette.
</p><br><p>Silvana’s face turned pale since it was Adam who was plunged into the wall, and on his chest was a massive, violent burn, as if from an explosion or the punishment of an evil sun.</p>
