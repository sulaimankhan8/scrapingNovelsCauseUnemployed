            <br><p>Adam and Scarlet Pyromancer's auras caused the other monsters that dwelled around Fume Cathedral to awaken.</p><br><p>Monsters were not willing to take part in absolutely any battle simply because they were monsters. They needed a purpose and most of the time, a simple interest or a strong opponent was enough.</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer like Adam and the rest of the Phantoms was not at all happy with the current situation. This land was not his territory, he was an outsider and he was being hunted by powerful Phantoms.</p><br><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer turned into a fiery flash and headed towards the nearest Weeping Haraha, there were only four of these monsters left, so they needed to be gotten rid of as soon as possible.</p><br><p>Last time Scarlet Pyromancer used either his horn or his glands to incinerate the enemies, but this time he decided to stick to a different tactic - full defense.</p><br><p>Weeping Haraha grinned widely with his hideous grin as thick ink flowed from his mouth, covering everything inside.</p><br><p>A multitude of long arms went towards Scarlet Pyromancer as if he were a foolish victim who had given himself up to a true predator. At least that's what Weeping Haraha thought.</p><br><p>Gradually, Weeping Haraha curled around Scarlet Pyromancer like a true centipede that tried to strangle or break its victim with its long and powerful body.</p><br><p>Sure, any other monster in Weeping Haraha's place would have been burned and turned to ash long ago. But, thanks to its strong body, Weeping Haraha could still withstand the heat coming from Scarlet Pyromancer for a long time.</p><br><p>However... Scarlet Pyromancer understood this as well.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Suddenly, the huge flame beetle began to tremble like a grenade that was ready to explode at any moment.</p><br><p>Weeping Haraha's eyes opened wide with interest as it watched its victim, the monster not suspecting anything.</p><br><p>Then, from the gaps between Scarlet Pyromancer's armor came a bright glow before Scarlet Pyromancer abruptly opened his massive wings.</p><br><p>To Adam who was watching this battle closely from afar, it looked like someone had pulled the pin of a grenade.</p><br><br><p>A fiery explosion of incredible power tore Weeping Haraha apart. Many of the monster's arms flew off to the sides lying next to the charred pieces of flesh.</p><br><p>The mask of the Weeping Haraha fell right next to Adam's feet. It was partially black from the fire and half covered in cracks. A black liquid, resembling a mixture of blood and ink, flowed out from under it.</p><br><p>Continue reading at мѵʟ</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly.</p><br><p>In a way Weeping Haraha's death was beneficial to him. Not only because now there were only three of those five monsters left, but also because he had seen what Scarlet Pyromancer was capable of.</p><br><p>Then, Adam turned towards where Oskar was only to see the aftermath of his battle.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..." Oskar was breathing heavily, his eyes were tired, but there was a satisfied smile on his face showing that he was the winner.</p><br><p>He held his massive sword tightly with one hand that was completely covered in the monster's dark blood.</p><br><p>"Hehehe, that wasn't that hard. However, despite their creepy appearance, they're damn stupid monsters." Oskar muttered looking at the many pieces of flesh scattered on the ground.</p><br><p>He cut Weeping Haraha into equal pieces as if he were chopping a vegetable rather than a creepy monster. However, Oskar also received a boost from Lero. A red magic circle shone brightly on his chest.</p><br><p>"Look out!" Erla exclaimed before committing a shot, aiming directly at the Weeping Haraha that towered over Oskar.</p><br><br><p>A blast of white flame covered the monster's head sending streams of fire downward.</p><br><p>The shot hit Weeping Haraha's head, but all Erla could achieve was a small crack in the monster's white mask.</p><br><p>Weeping Haraha tilted his head with narrowed eyes staring at Erla. It was unhappy that Erla had attacked him.</p><br><p>Oskar smirked as his fist shone brightly with golden light. In a heartbeat, he swept his palm across the blade of his sword filling it with a tremendous force of light.</p><br><p>Then, Oskar stepped forward and lunged with his sword, releasing a dense beam of light that crashed straight into the crack on the monster's mask.</p><br><p>Before Weeping Haraha could do anything its head exploded causing the monster's huge body to fall to the ground, raising a tall cloud of dust.</p><br><p>"Well, they're not that strong, though... It's only an illusion." Oskar said with an excited expression before frowning heavily.</p><br><p>He was under reinforcement and was only able to kill the second Weeping Haraha by using his Second Order.</p><br><p>Considering that Weeping Harahas were rather weak monsters among their level, Oskar had to spend a lot of resources to defeat such an opponent.</p><br><p>He usually killed Purple Threat level monsters with his physical power and huge sword, often while under Lero's enhancement. A few swings of the sword were enough to kill many monsters, but this time things were different.</p><br><p>There were far more monsters than Oskar had the opportunity to use his abilities. If there were not five but twenty Weeping Harahas here, they wouldn't be able to do anything. They simply didn't have enough strength to deal with so many powerful opponents.</p><br><p>'By the way, if I was under a few reinforcements, I might have been able to deal with the Weeping Harahas without difficulty. So he should have finished by now, right?' Oskar pondered before glancing to the left, where the last Weeping Haraha was.</p><br><br><p>The first thing he saw was the silver thread that twisted around Weeping Haraha's head, and then Adam swept past the massive monster, pulling his needle.</p><br><p>The monster's head fell to the ground with a thick stream of blood pouring out.</p><br><p>Oskar frowned. He was jealous that Adam could do it so easily.</p><br><p>'Good job. You killed all the Weeping Harahas.' Silvana said calmly.</p><br><p>Adam nodded. He wanted to say something, but he abruptly had to duck.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer swept over him leaving a plume of flame behind him. Strangely enough, Scarlet Pyromancer headed straight for Fume Cathedral.</p><br><p>"What the hell?" Adam muttered in confusion. It seemed to him that Scarlet Pyromancer was doing this in an attempt to escape and not because he had any particular plan or purpose.</p><br><p>'Adam! Turn around! You and everyone else need to run away now!' Silvana exclaimed with obvious alarm in her voice.</p><br><p>Adam asked no questions and did as she said. The scene he saw made his eyes go wide with horror and confusion.</p><br><p>Earlier he had seen several silhouettes heading in their direction, but because of the thick dark fog covering everything in Fallen Crypt, he couldn't realize how great the danger really was.</p><br><p>Dozens, no, even hundreds of monsters were heading in their direction, shaking the ground beneath their powerful footsteps and fast-moving paws leaving cuts on the ground from their sharp claws.</p><br><p>Gradually, the shaking became stronger and stronger as if it was an earthquake or a mad horde of monsters that aimed to arrive at the battle site as quickly as possible, where they sensed two powerful aura sources.</p><br><p>'Hurry up! All of you, run to Fume Cathedral! It's dangerous there, but clearly safer than staying here! Don't waste a second!' Silvana exclaimed relaying her message to all the Phantoms, not just Adam.</p>
