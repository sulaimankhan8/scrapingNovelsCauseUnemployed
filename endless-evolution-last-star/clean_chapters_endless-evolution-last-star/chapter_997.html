            <br><p>Defeat was not something Kreyna was used to. She didn't consider herself the strongest and fully understood that Arnoth was more powerful.</p><br><p>But... Losing to some serpent and not particularly strong Phantom?</p><br><p>Kreyna couldn't even imagine such nonsense appearing in her mind.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Her body rolled across the ground from Risha's powerful throw. With each thrust, her sharp armor left cracks and fractures in the marble floor until the momentum ceased and she stopped.</p><br><p>Vorx and Risha glanced over at each other. He smiled with a slight nod and immediately returned the serious expression, pointing to Kreyna, who was already rising from the ground.</p><br><p>True, they had started the fight with a successful attack, but it was far from a victory.</p><br><p>'Shit...' Risha gulped looking at the shallow cut on Kreyna's side, rare trickles of blood running down her armor. 'I strike at full strength! If it were an S3 monster, I would have chopped it in two by now!'</p><br><p>Sure, Risha didn't expect to be able to defeat Kreyna in one attack. Regardless of her position at the Fallen Ring Castle, she was an S5 monster. This was a level that Risha was still not strong enough for.</p><br><p>Slowly, Kreyna touched her side, looking at her bloody palm.</p><br><p>Anger appeared in her eyes for a moment, then came another emotion.</p><br><p>The corners of her lips went up, pulling her pale skin into a creepy grin.</p><br><p>"Hahaha! So that was your best plan?!" she laughed grimly. "Come on. Vorx, I thought you'd come up with a better plan. Because that was your last attack!"</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Kreyna tore forward. The darkness from her shadow followed her, slowly enveloping her legs.</p><br><p>Risha looked at her mirror boots for a moment. She nodded deeply, gripped her axe tightly, and rushed into battle.</p><br><p>Their plan was for Vorx to take the first part of the fight, but Risha realized that she had to take the attack. If she could wound Kreyna one more time, they would be much closer to victory.</p><br><br><p>The two figures clashed with each other, lingering at the same point for only a fraction of a second.</p><br><p>At the last moment, something in Risha's instincts caused her to turn her torso to the right, bringing her shoulder up in front of her neck.</p><br><p>As it turned out, it might have saved her life.</p><br><br><p>Risha and Kreyna stopped twenty meters away from each other. They clashed for only one attack, and not the results Risha had expected.</p><br><p>A stream of blood rushed from Risha's shoulder as she fell to one knee.</p><br><p>'Tsk, you shouldn't have done that, you fool!' Radiant Mirage exclaimed, with a great frown. 'At that distance and with that weapon... You just didn't stand a chance against her blades.'</p><br><p>"Well, I had to try, anyway. It's just a cut." Risha clutched her shoulder tightly, rising firmly to her feet.</p><br><p>Kreyna turned around, staring at Risha with shock on her face.</p><br><p>"What...? How did you survive, girl? Your head should be lying on the floor by now!" Kreyna exclaimed furiously, considering this as her great failure.</p><br><p>Then, something silenced her.</p><br><p>A light cut opened on her cheek as a single trickle of blood ran down her smooth skin.</p><br><p>Her face paled as she touched her cheek. It seemed like her worst nightmare happened.</p><br><br><p>Kreyna clenched her fists tightly, darkness running through her body in wild flames.</p><br><p>"How dare you touch my FACE?!"</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a flaming palm fell on her face.</p><br><p>Vorx tore forward holding Kreyna above the ground like a puppet. His eyes were cold, deadly serious, while his sharp claws dug into Kreyna's skin that she was so worried about.</p><br><p>Before Kreyna could do anything, Vorx lunged forward, leaving a fiery blast behind him.</p><br><p>Shards of marble flew behind his back as he slammed Kreyna's back into the first column.</p><br><p>"Grh!" she gasped in pain, but with her next breath, they reached the next column and another.</p><br><p>Using the full force of his flame, Vorx reached a frightening speed, yet he was not running but rather leaping.</p><br><p>As soon as his feet touched the surface, he would turn into a flaming flash as he reached the next column.</p><br><p>For that brief period, Vorx's speed surpassed Kreyna's abilities and even Risha's gaze.</p><br><p>Her eyes didn't have time to see what was happening in detail.</p><br><p>Risha gulped in a thrill.</p><br><p>All she could see was a fiery flash sweeping across the first floor of the castle, leaving behind only black stains and ruined columns.</p><br><p>"You... Don't think you can...!" Kreyna wheezed as blood rushed from her mouth.</p><br><p>A gleam ran down her blade, she was ready to cut off Vorx's hands. She could do it in an instant.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Vorx stepped back.</p><br><p>Two dark blades flashed before his eyes. He was doing everything on the edge of his power - it was the only way he could defeat Kreyna.</p><br><p>His frame shuddered as a massive shadow fell over Kreyna.</p><br><p>Unlike her, Vorx, like any serpent, could fight in two forms, a monster or a human.</p><br><p>"Shit..." Kreyna gulped, looking at the huge serpent appearing out of nowhere.</p><br><p>Her legs twitched, wanting to step aside, but it was already too late.</p><br><p>Like a whip, Vorx's tail came down on Kreyna, sealing her into the ground.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Vorx wasn't going to stop. His tail slammed into Kreyna over and over again, tearing through her armor and covering her back in bloody lines.</p><br><p>At Kreyna's next attempt to get up, Vorx's pupils narrowed full of fear as he grabbed her with his tail and threw her hundreds of meters forward - to the far side of the castle.</p><br><p>While she was still in flight, she shot a flaming beam from his serpent jaw.</p><br><br><p>The deafening explosion shook countless columns, and the shockwave reached Risha, rippling her hair under her shocked gaze.</p><br><p>She couldn't believe that anyone could have survived after something like that.</p><br><p>'Holy shit... If Vorx did something like that against me, I'd be dead by now!'</p><br><p>But... fear soon covered her face.</p><br><p>Kreyna's silhouette, hidden behind a cloud of dust, slowly rose up. Her eyes were filled with cold anger.</p><br><p>With a slight sweep of her blade, the darkness from her shadow traveled in two directions, forming a circle the size of half of the first floor.</p><br><p>Everyone inside was her prey.</p>
