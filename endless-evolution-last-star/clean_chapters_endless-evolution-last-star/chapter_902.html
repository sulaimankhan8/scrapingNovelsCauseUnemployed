            <br><p>Thanks to Chloe's efforts, there was no need to prepare breakfast. They had everything they needed - coffee, tea, pancakes, honey, and cheese cream.</p><br><p>Reinz sat at the table with his face red with shame. He was embarrassed that he had shown up in front of Erik and the others practically naked, but Julia's comment made everything a hundred times worse!</p><br><p>"Come on." Julia punched him lightly in the shoulder, "No offense. You accomplished a lot yesterday both as Phantom and as Chloe's partner, didn't you?"</p><br><p>Julia glanced at Chloe, she licked her lips predatorily.</p><br><p>Now, Chloe was blushing too, but she didn't correct Julia, she was right, and she knew it.</p><br><p>Erik put the half-empty cup of coffee aside and slowly clapped his hands together.</p><br><p>"Alright, day three has begun, and we are already ahead of schedule. Toda,y Adam and Reinz will take care of strengthening the Outer Energy Control, then it will come down to the Infusive Energy Control.</p><br><p>"After that, heh..."</p><br><p>Erik threw one leg over the other.</p><br><p>"If Adam and Reinz succeed, one will go up at the Heaven Island and the other down at the Lower Ring, so we won't waste any more time. Agreed?"</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz nodded at the same time.</p><br><p>Immediately after breakfast, they were in the arena. Everything was back to normal, and no more Adam fighting against Reinz, the old rules worked - the two of them against Julia in bloody armor.</p><br><p>Clash. Clash. Clash.</p><br><p>Julia stood still as two steel swords full of energy tried to reach her through the layer of lightning crystal tails arrayed on her defenses.</p><br><p>Without the use of the second type of energy control, the steel swords would have shattered after the first collision, but that time had passed.</p><br><p>Now, the swords were full of the energy of the two K3-Phantoms, if Julia wasn't Erik's Operator, she couldn't have lasted against their onslaught for even a few seconds.</p><br><p>With each new round of training, she had to speed up and increase the number of tails, first to three, now the number grew to four.</p><br><p>'Not bad, not bad at all...' Julia pondered, looking at their fiery gazes, 'They're not trying to outmaneuver me or trick me. They're just going for it, holding their swords tightly and pouring their energy into the blades.'</p><br><p>After a few moments, Julia raised her hand with an open palm.</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz immediately bounced back. This gesture showed that the training had been stopped.</p><br><p>''Good. I doubt you've mastered the Outer Energy Control perfectly in the time you've had, but it's a decent result." Julia nodded deeply, her arms crossed over her chest.</p><br><p>Then, four crystal tails presented themselves to her gaze. The edges were scratched and damaged, unlike the steel swords. It seemed like it shouldn't be that way, considering Julia's armor was created by Erik. After all, the difference between him and Adam and Reinz was an unbridgeable abyss.</p><br><p>"As you can see, my tails aren't in the best condition, but don't get cocky - it was all thought out by Erik."</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head in confusion, "What do you mean? I thought you were in charge of our training."</p><br><p>"Sure, but besides my opinion, there had to be some measure of your success. Erik put just enough energy into my armor that it was at the level of the K3-Phantoms," she waved her hand, "In other words, the fact that your swords remained unscathed and my armor did not is proof that your control is at a very high level."</p><br><p>They looked at the swords simultaneously, the blades were intact, unlike the edges of Julia's tails.</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Reinz rumbled thoughtfully, "I see, attack is always stronger than defense, with all other things equal. So we pass the test, right?"</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes sparkled. He hadn't originally been interested in the Outer Energy Control too much. Probably because he easily figured out how to achieve the result, or maybe because he wanted to get to the third type faster.</p><br><p>"Does that mean we will now start training the Infusive Energy Control?" he asked in excitement.</p><br><p>Julia nodded weakly.</p><br><p>"Cool! Let's start right now! What do we need to do?"</p><br><p>However, unfortunately for Adam, Julia wasn't going to rush.</p><br><p>"Calm down. I'm not going to train you. It's one thing the Outer Energy Control, you need a long fight and motivation here, but the Infusive One..." her eyes grew deeper, "You need a Phantom here, not an Operator."</p><br><br><p>The bloody armor shattered into shards as she headed for the exit.</p><br><p>"I'll report your progress to Erik, in the meantime you can have a sparring session or something. I don't care."</p><br><p>As Julia said this she left, leaving Reinz and Adam alone.</p><br><p>They looked at each other, feeling rather strange.</p><br><p>They hadn't known each other a few days ago and at the height of their relationship, they were adversaries of each other at the Twilight Palace. There was nothing wrong with that, they were two young men who shouldn't have met in a normal situation.</p><br><p>If it wasn't for Douglas's setup, Adam wouldn't have ended up at the Twilight Palace.</p><br><p>'What's more...' Adam pondered, 'Even though Erik says he's just going with the flow, he's the one who contributed the necessary 700 million to get me to fight against Reinz.</p><br><p>'Hah... I'm sure the odds were much lower on me than onReinz. He must have made a fortune.'</p><br><p>Now, Reinz and Adam were much closer. They weren't friends, but good acquaintances, which for a high noble and commoner was rare. Especially when they were both K3-Phantoms.</p><br><p>"So..." Reinz lingered, scratching the back of his head, "How about we fight to solidify the result?"</p><br><br><p>Adam waved his hand, tossing his sword aside.</p><br><p>Reinz stayed behind, his face frozen in place full of puzzlement. He clearly expected a different answer, and he didn't understand the reason for the rejection.</p><br><p>He had learned a lot about Adam in a few days, but only one thing Reinz was sure - Adam enjoyed fighting. Well, if the fight was worth it.</p><br><p>Then, Adam stopped and glanced at Reinz over his shoulder, a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Let's go to the table, before the last clash I wrote to Silvana. Pancakes are waiting for us, again. Fighting is good of course, but I'd like to know more about your family.</p><br><p>"After all, it's not every day you run into the offspring of the first great family."</p>
