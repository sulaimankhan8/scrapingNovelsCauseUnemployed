            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1203: Hand and Tail (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Besides her halberds and sharp claws, Bathild had another weapon—her tail. It was strong, sharp, and extremely fast, so she usually didn’t worry that her opponent could somehow hurt her tail.</p><br><p>However, this was not a normal situation.</p><br><p>She was fighting Adam and knew that his strongest ability was that he could cut through anything.</p><br><p>Obviously, the position Bathild found herself in put her tail at risk. She didn’t expect Adam to sacrifice his hand to injure her tail.</p><br><p>No, what frightened her was the glint of the great needle in Adam’s hand. She knew that if it was Adam Vinter’s weapon, the next slash would take half her tail.</p><br><p>Naturally, Bathild couldn’t let that happen.</p><br><p>She believed that her tail was more important to her than Adam’s right hand was to him.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Bathild surged forward as the broad blade of her halberd came before Adam’s face.</p><br><p>Electric discharges rushed toward him to prevent him from making the cut, but he had no intention of doing so.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam let go of Bathild’s tail and jerked his head to the side, dodging her attack at the last moment.</p><br><p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p><br><p>With a crash, the halberd plunged halfway into the wall as rocks collapsed from above.</p><br><p>Before Bathild could realize what was happening, Adam’s fist plunged into her stomach, throwing her back several meters. Taken by surprise, she loosened her grip, and the halberd slipped from her hands.</p><br><p>Then, Adam changed his needles as a second, white one appeared in his hand.</p><br><p>Bathild looked up only to see Adam, who had swung his needle, leaving a straight line in the air.</p><br><br><p>Blood gushed out to her left as her eyes turned to that spot.</p><br><p>Her pupils narrowed in horror as she realized that Adam was already behind her and there was a wide gash on her left side.</p><br><p>This was not the kind of wound she was prepared to receive when she went into battle against Adam Vinter. It was much worse.</p><br><p>In the blink of an eye, she realized that if she didn’t do something, she would lose several liters of blood in the next minute.</p><br><p>The worst part was that Adam wasn’t going to stop. Before Bathild’s back could touch the wall, Adam’s hand twitched.</p><br><p>He was about to swing the needle again, and Bathild might not survive.</p><br><p>‘I know you were skeptical about this position,’ Adam muttered to himself, addressing Silvana. ‘But she’s no different from Lyrod. Sure, she’s stronger, but right now I could beat Lyrod much faster. Her difficulty level is the same… maybe even lower.”</p><br><p>Bathild couldn’t hear this, as they were Adam’s thoughts, but she understood what he was feeling from his expression.</p><br><p>In his eyes, she saw only disappointment and boredom.</p><br><p>This was clearly not how the Phantom should feel in front of her. The other Phantoms trembled in fear. She had killed dozens of them in her long life. Many begged her to spare their lives.</p><br><p>But… The very Phantom she wanted to fight looked at her like she was a piece of shit not worth his efforts. And, considering Adam’s earlier words, that was exactly how it was.</p><br><p>Unlike Bathild, he had no reason to fight her.</p><br><p>‘No, I can’t let this happen! That little bastard… Adam Vinter, you won’t be the one to kill me! I’ll rip your head off and get my title!’</p><br><p>TREMBLE. TREMBLE. TREMBLE.</p><br><p>Dense electrical discharges ran through Bathild’s body as her dark azure hair glowed brightly, turning closer to turquoise.</p><br><p>The same thing happened to her eyes as her veins swelled. Even through the skin and stone layer of her protective plates, lightning could be seen running through her veins.</p><br><p>Still, the tattoo on her chest remained inactive. She wasn’t that desperate, yet.</p><br><br><p>A split second before Adam’s lesser path was about to cut her in two, her frame shook and disappeared from Adam’s field of vision.</p><br><br><p>Blue lightning appeared at the wall before Bathild, as her hand tightened its grip on the hilt of her halberd.</p><br><p>With ease, she pulled her weapon out with one hand before turning over her shoulder.</p><br><p>Her and Adam’s eyes met. They had both suffered serious wounds, but it was Bathild who had to act first.</p><br><p>Not giving Adam time to react, she lunged forward, ending up right in front of him.</p><br><p>“It’s time to change the battlefield, Adam Vinter!”</p><br><p>The blade of her halberd reflected in Adam’s eyes as he changed his needles again.</p><br><p>THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!</p><br><p>The tremors from their clashes spread throughout the Kirani Colony, not just one but dozens of shudders, each slightly higher than the last.</p><br><p>Fromund slowly raised his head, watching their movements through the falling dust and the pulsations from their attacks.</p><br><p>“Hell… Not only have they decided to fight one-on-one, but they’ve left me here alone?”</p><br><p>He glanced at the Kirani Bugs surrounding him and frowned.</p><br><p>“Damn! You don’t even dare to come near me!”</p><br><p>Well, Fromund didn’t have long to wait.</p><br><p>Marhen and the other thunder monsters were already close enough to feel the tremors from Bathild’s attacks.</p><br><p>“Alright, get ready, we’ll be there soon!” Marhen exclaimed as he waved his hand. “It looks like Miss Bathild is already fighting Adam Vinter, we have to deal with the second Phantom!”</p><br><p>“Tsk, as if that’s going to be difficult,” one of the monsters spat out.</p><br><p>His friend looked away. “Yeah, let’s just do it. I don’t know who it is, but even Adam Vinter won’t be able to stand against all of us.”</p><br><p>“Hah, I’m sure as soon as that Phantom sees how many of us there are, he’ll start begging for mercy! We’ll win easily because there are more of us!”</p><br><p>You couldn’t blame the monsters for thinking that way. Numerical superiority could be important, especially if the two sides were roughly equal in strength.</p><br><p>However, they didn’t know that among the two Phantoms, the more convenient opponent for them would be Adam, who specialized in 1-on-1 combat, rather than Fromund, who was just waiting for the right moment to turn a bunch of monsters into ash.</p>
