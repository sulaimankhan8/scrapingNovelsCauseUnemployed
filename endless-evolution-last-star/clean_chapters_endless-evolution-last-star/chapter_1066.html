            <h4>Chapter 1066: Two Barons and the Main Course (Part 1)</h4><br><p>"WHAT? How dare you talk to us, Phantom, like that?! Get back to the Citadel quickly! This is the last chance we can give you!" The woman angrily exclaimed while flapping her wings.
</p><br><p>The mere movement of her wings was enough to send a wave of violent wind that could leave cuts on Gladius’s face, but nothing happened. The first guardian couldn’t even get the sly smile off his face.
</p><br><p>If not for the orders of the authorities from the Befallen Crown, the woman would have killed the arrogant Phantom in front of her long ago. The man would have done the same.
</p><br><p>They simply acted by the rules, which was what the mute part of the Befallen Crown’s authority rested on.
</p><br><p>Without rules, all that was left was uncontrolled freedom, which quickly turned into destructive chaos.
</p><br><p>"Hey, you still don’t understand what’s going on here, right?"
</p><br><p>The woman and the man exchanged a glance. The two guards were confused, it was clear from their faces. They still didn’t understand why the Phantom in front of them was acting so confident.
</p><br><p>His aura wasn’t that strong.
</p><br><p>Had they guessed that Gladius could hide his aura? Sure, after all, they were Lords, even if they were only Barons. That was enough to instill fear in anyone who wasn’t a Second Rank Phantom.
</p><br><p>It didn’t matter if it was a newcomer, a simple K0-Phantom, or an experienced K4-Phantom who was almost at the pinnacle of evolution. For Baron, to kill Phantoms of that level of strength was not a big problem.
</p><br><br><p>"Alright, I don’t really want to waste a lot of time on you, but what’s about to happen has only you to blame. You, Lords, so... I can show you something special."
</p><br><p>The woman and man said nothing. Flames covered their wings and arms as their faces twisted in grimaces.
</p><br><p>Was some Phantom offering them a battle?
</p><br><p>They were ready to accept the challenge and turn it into ash!
</p><br><br><p>Their frames trembled as they tore toward him. One second, perhaps less, and their palms like flaming spears would pierce Gladius’s chest.
</p><br><p>But... for some reason, the world was no longer as fast as usual.
</p><br><p>Everything around them became slow, everything except their thoughts and Gladius’s actions, who turned for power from the depths of his inner space, his Evolution Tree.
</p><br><p>The purple energy circle soared before him, trembling slightly between his hands - something that could not be had by anyone who had not reached the very peak of power.
</p><br><p>Many mysterious stars wandered among the circle, some brighter, some larger, some trying to hide behind others from Gladius’s gaze. In some ways, they resembled humans and monsters.
</p><br><p>"Barons means... You are the weakest of the strongest... It’s enough to make you look at everyone else as your victim, as prey. And, in most cases, you have that right. There are a few monsters and Phantoms in this world that can stand up to you, but... You are not the strongest, and you should realize that."
</p><br><p>Gladius’s eyes shone brightly with purple light.
</p><br><p>"There is always someone who stands higher, always someone who will eat your kind for dinner."
</p><br><p>Darkness filled his voice.
</p><br><p>"In this case, that would be me."
</p><br><br><p>From the multitude of stars, Gladius chose one particular one. Then, the circle disappeared as well as all the stars. For a moment, behind him appeared the spectral silhouette of the girl who touched the star with him.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, the purple field swept from Gladius for dozens of meters around, passing through the two demon guards. There was nothing they could do to stop it or affect it.
</p><br><p>After all, everything that just happened was coming from Gladius’s inner space, where time flowed differently.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The ground shook, allowing darkness to fill the sphere, completely depriving all three of the ability to see.
</p><br><p>Then, when the woman and man opened their eyes, they found themselves in a strange place.
</p><br><p>There was only darkness around, in the distance stood Gladius, who greeted them with a calm expression.
</p><br><p>"Welcome, to my little feast." Gladius smiled as he bowed with a wave of his hand like a waiter in a luxurious restaurant.
</p><br><p>Two hands of his inner demon appeared from above, skinny arms and long fingers with sharp tips hovering above them while the demon showed his glowing grin with eyes narrowed into crescents.
</p><br><br><p>Gladius stepped forward as he moved ten meters forward.
</p><br><p>The two demon guards hadn’t realized it yet, but they were in Gladius’s full power. They, as Barons, were in no position to resist Gladius.
</p><br><p>"What’s going on...?" the woman exclaimed, her voice trembling with terror.
</p><br><br><p>Another Gladius’s step as the guards directed their gazes downward.
</p><br><p>Only now did they realize that they were no longer on the ground or in the air - they were on a table, a huge table as if they were at a giant’s dinner.
</p><br><p>"Hah, it looks like you’re beginning to realize what’s going on. This is my ability, the Devil Feast! Please don’t ruin this wonderful dinner! I’ve worked so hard to prepare everything!" Gladius exclaimed, pressing his palm against his heart, which was beating faster and faster with each passing second.
</p><br><br><p>The sound of metal made the guards look up. In the demon’s hands appeared a knife and fork, ordinary cutlery. They were suitable for cutting a steak, but not for killing like a hunter’s dagger.
</p><br><p>"NO...! We have to get out of here!" The woman screamed, she summoned currents of flame with flaps of her wings.
</p><br><p>The man aimed all the fire at one point, building up a devastating orb between his hands.
</p><br><p>"I just need a little time and... I’ll blow this space!" He exclaimed, accumulating more power.
</p><br><p>But... the explosion was not meant to happen.
</p><br><br><p>Gladius snapped his fingers as the guards appeared on the plate.
</p><br><p>"As I said, you will be my main course tonight." Gladius’s voice boomed from above.
</p><br><p>His figure was now at full height, looking at the two guards, at the two Lesser Lords like frightened bugs on a plate.</p>
