            <br><p>Adam lay on the bed, staring up at the ceiling.</p><br><p>He was in this state for hours now, keeping his hands on his chest and breathing slowly.</p><br><p>Yesterday was his last fight during training in the Gray Castle, he was still in the training complex, but no one else was going to train him.</p><br><p>Sure, no one forbade Adam from using weights or blue zone, but solo it wouldn't be the same. Moreover, he no longer had the desire to, as he realized that he was already at the end of this part of his story.</p><br><p>Nevertheless, Adam didn't know what to occupy himself with.</p><br><p>There were many beautiful places with rich nature around Gray Castle, but he walked for half a day yesterday after the fight against Max, and that was enough for him.</p><br><br><p>Silvana entered the room. She knew that Adam already finished his training and that he was bored, so... she had a solution.</p><br><p>Adam cast a glance in her direction, about to say hello, but he didn't as his gaze locked on what was in Silvana's hands - two outfits, one male and one female.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Am I missing something?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>Silvana smiled, placed the suits on the chair, and sat next to Adam, on the edge of the bed.</p><br><p>"Well, there's too little time left before the wedding for you to do anything important or get proper rest, but... there is one event that will be good to attend. I'd even say we owe it to ourselves to go to it."</p><br><p>Adam still didn't understand anything. Silvana was talking like something important was going to happen soon, but he didn't know about anything like that.</p><br><p>"I think you know that Max can and wants to become a Phantom, but the only thing stopping him from going to Dead Lands is that he needs to look after his niece, Lona." Silvana said calmly with a slight wave of her hand.</p><br><p>Adam was silent for a while, then he nodded, Max mentioned it several times when they fought as well as Riska.</p><br><p>"I see... Yeah, I know about his situation, but what does this have to do with us and these suits? And, what do we have to do with Lona?" Adam turned around, lying down on his side.</p><br><p>Silvana chuckled sweetly.</p><br><p>"Well, Lona's institute had a final exam a few days ago and she passed."</p><br><br><p>"Congratulations, I guess?" Adam looked at Silvana uncertainly.</p><br><p>Silvana took a deep breath before getting to the heart of the matter: "Tonight all the graduates of Lona's institute will have a showcase performance at the theater, don't forget she studied for years to become an actor. Not only the graduates will be at the performance, but also professional actors, beginners, and pros will be working together."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide as he finally realized what Silvana had come up with.</p><br><p>"Wait... While it's a good idea, don't you have to buy tickets in advance? If it's something rare, then seats are surely already gone."</p><br><p>Silvana smiled before slipping her hand into her pocket and showing two yellow tickets.</p><br><p>"Don't worry, I've taken care of everything. We still have time, but if we want to get to the theater early, I think we should start packing now."</p><br><p>Adam looked closely at the tickets taking them in his hands.</p><br><p>"Wow... When did you make it?"</p><br><p>Silvana giggled, covering her mouth with the palm.</p><br><p>"Not even a month ago. I was sure Lona would pass the exam, and the date of the performance was known as well as the wedding date, so calculating everything wasn't a big deal."</p><br><p>Then, Silvana pointed to their costumes.</p><br><p>"So... How about we try on the suit I picked out for you? We've been to a serious event once before, the Red Feast, but it required a very different kind of outfit..."</p><br><p>Adam nodded, his eyes sparkling, glad to be rid of the boredom that managed to consume him in just a few hours.</p><br><p>After a short conversation, they immediately started trying on suits. Silvana knew all of Adam's sizes, so she had no trouble finding something perfect for him.</p><br><p>However... that didn't mean Adam was satisfied.</p><br><p>"What the hell...? Why are these clothes so tight?" Adam frowned, standing in front of the mirror.</p><br><p>He was wearing a classic black suit, with a white shirt, and no tie but with big cufflinks, strict, tight black pants, and leather shoes.</p><br><p>"Damn, if I do that and put some effort into it I'll rip it!" Adam uttered before thrusting his arms forward, straining his back that was getting bigger by the second.</p><br><br><p>Silvana's palm smacked into Adam's back, causing him to wince in shock.</p><br><p>"Stop doing that! This suit is tailored to your measurements, but that doesn't include you squirming like an idiot in front of the mirror and straining your muscles making them several times bigger!" Silvana said sternly, staring intently at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam just shrugged with a nonchalant expression on his face.</p><br><p>"I'm just not used to this sort of thing. Those costumes that Cazimir made for us were much more comfortable and had something unique, a style I liked much better than the pure strict classic."</p><br><p>Silvana waved her hands to the side, shaking her head.</p><br><p>"Well, those were the costumes for the Red Feast, a different plan and level of event there. Anyway, what do you think of my outfit?"</p><br><p>Hearing Silvana, Adam turned around, running his gaze over her body, top to bottom.</p><br><p>Silvana's dress was split into two distinct parts, the top was gray with long sleeves becoming wide at the ends and wavy fabric cascading from her shoulders to her waist.</p><br><p>The bottom was something between loose black pants and a skirt, it was two in one, the fabric of the skirt fluttered with every movement but Silvana's legs were completely covered up to her ankles. On her feet were low-heeled shoes.</p><br><p>"Hah, you decided to dress me in strict classics but for yourself, you took something unconventional and loose? Don't you want to switch? I mean, not clothes, but styles." Adam suggested with a smile on his face.</p><br><p>Silvana looked embarrassed for a moment, her cheeks flushed, then she sighed.</p><br><p>"Unfortunately it's too late. Finding a new suit and choosing a design takes a lot of time, which we just don't have."</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward and confidently took Silvana's hand, drawing her closer to him.</p><br><p>"Come on, I'm just kidding. But next time pick something more appropriate for my tastes... This suit makes me feel like I'm in chains." Adam said glancing down at his hands.</p><br><p>Silvana smirked as she ran her fingertips over his shoulder, tapping gently.</p><br><p>"Oh, are you going to attend events like this before? Am I slowly immersing you in the world of high culture?"</p><br><p>Adam smirked a dangerous glint flickered in his eyes.</p><br><p>"High culture? Hah, I don't mean to devalue anyone's hard work, actors, artists, musicians, they create true masterpieces and to understand their work is cool, but..." Your journey continues on empire</p><br><p>Adam's gaze grew darker, staring intently at Silvana who froze in place from his stare.</p><br><p>"Once you get back to Dead Lands, you'll forget about it right away. No painting, song, or movie can burn into my memory a scene as vivid as the Plague Reaper did."</p><br><br><p>Adam's grip tightened slightly, squeezing Silvana's shoulders tightly.</p>
