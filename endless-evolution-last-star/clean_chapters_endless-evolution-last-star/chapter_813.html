            <br><p>Hesitantly, Katrin tried to get up. Adam was ready to help her, he held out his hand, but she ignored him, trying to make it on her own.</p><br><p>At the very end, due to her trembling legs, she stumbled, ready to collapse to the ground again.</p><br><p>Before that happened, Adam grabbed her wrist and held her by the shoulder, helping her stand straight.</p><br><p>"Fuck... How weak I am, this is humiliating..."</p><br><p>Adam behind her smiled slightly.</p><br><p>"Is it? There's nothing wrong with being weak, but... staying weak is destructive, especially for those who seek power."</p><br><p>Katrin looked away, pondering his words. In any other situation, she would irritably exclaim at the fact that he was touching her, but right now, she didn't have the energy for such nonsense.</p><br><p>"Why did you come down from the spire?"</p><br><p>"What are you talking about?" he asked, his voice low and calm.</p><br><p>Reluctantly, Katrin cast a glance at him.</p><br><p>"The Crimson Monarch's gene. Even if you're not going to replace your gene, it would be useful to absorb it, if only to develop the Gene Field, am I not right?"</p><br><br><p>Then, Adam turned towards the spire.</p><br><p>"Damn... it's high. I didn't think of that, I don't know how important it is, but it's too late. Kyros is completely gone."</p><br><p>"K-Kyros?" Katrin stammered.</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, his eyes filled with meaning.</p><br><p>"That's the name of the Crimson Monarch or rather was... I know it's unusual for monsters to have names, but it seems he's not the first one. You and I are too weak, for now."</p><br><p>After a few seconds of silence, something came to Katrin's mind. She was about to say her thoughts but stopped abruptly.</p><br><p>Suddenly, a dense crimson energy appeared beside Adam, coming from the top of the spire.</p><br><p>Adam was as baffled as Katrin. In a way, it was the Crimson Monarch's gene, only split into billions of pieces, becoming an array of energy.</p><br><br><p>Adam turned around, trying to figure out why the energy was headed towards him, though he already accepted the fact that he hadn't absorbed the Crimson Monarch's gene.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Deep inside, he felt a shiver, like the movements of a snake, not very active, but forced because of the tragedy suffered.</p><br><p>Before Adam could realize anything, the red energy streamed in a powerful flow towards his chest, disappearing into the depths of his inner space.</p><br><p>With visible uncertainty, Katrin took a few steps to the side.</p><br><br><p>Adam looked at his hands, his fingertips trembling, but that was due to wild fatigue. The energy had nothing to do with it.</p><br><p>"I don't know, but I feel fine. Well..." he thought of Moira, "I have some assumptions but I'll deal with them later."</p><br><br><p>Katrin narrowed her eyes looking at Adam's coat.</p><br><br><p>With a sweep of her hand, the coat shuddered, becoming a thick black mass. At her will, the coat returned to its original owner, taking a suitably warm shape for Katrin.</p><br><p>"Hey, it's cold in here." Adam smiled mockingly.</p><br><p>"Pffft, I don't care about that. You should be grateful that I gave you my ability, for a while..."</p><br><p>With a slight sigh, Adam shrugged.</p><br><p>"Hah, can't argue with that. It's a cool ability, like a living weapon and a loyal ally with a will of its own. I wish I had something like that."</p><br><p>A confident smirk showed on Katrin's face as she waved her hand proudly.</p><br><p>"At least I surpass you in something. I hope it stays that way."</p><br><p>Watching the sunrise for a while, Katrin looked at Adam, her gaze serious.</p><br><p>"What do you plan to do next? You seem to have some unfinished business. I can sense it from your... double aura."</p><br><p>"Yeah, you're right. The fighters will be here soon, but I still have some time."</p><br><p>Without saying anything else, Adam headed forward. Many thoughts haunted him, defeating the Crimson Monarch was crucial, but not the last event related to the fortress.</p><br><p>Now, he was going to solve the issue that started everything else, heading for the depths.</p><br><p>A few minutes later, using a way that only he knew, Adam found himself in the caverns.</p><br><p>He stood before a massive crystal, the External Artifact - the Lone Blaze's true form.</p><br><p>With a serene look, Adam touched the sun seal on his chest and asked:</p><br><br><p>Strangely enough, a voice echoed in his mind:</p><br><br><p>Confusion reflected on Adam's face.</p><br><br><p>[The pact is finished, or rather, all the conditions are fulfilled, the only thing left is my consent for it to close. However, you decide how that happens.]</p><br><p>Lone Blaze continued:</p><br><p>[You can reject me and leave me here. In that case, I will either be swallowed by some monster or more likely, the Phantoms that would come here will take me to pieces, valuable crystals with extreme energy density.]</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam nodded, his expression turning serious.</p><br><p>He realized that there was no one else to protect Lone Blaze. The Blind Sinner was gone, the fortress was destroyed, and most of the monsters were dead. Sure, the Phantoms had no fewer casualties, but they were not tied to one place like Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>Then, Adam raised his head.</p><br><p>"What's the second option? Apparently, you have a way to avoid that fate, right?"</p><br><p>[Yes... In that case, you will absorb me. You'll get the last star to complete the Star Seal, as well as my power. However, I must warn you about two things.]</p><br><p>Adam said nothing, he listened intently, for this was his last step towards the Second Key.</p><br><p>The alliance with Lone Blaze should not be a mistake. It must be a deliberate decision.</p><br><p>[This is different from anything that's happened to you before. You won't just get my energy, I'll become a part of you. Just like I am now, and I'll be settling into your Initial Gene.]</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, Lone Blaze continued:</p><br><p>[But... I will not only affect you, but also your Operator. Silvana's Evolution Seed. She knows about me. I and the Evolution Tree told her about the way she healed your wound, but not now...]</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The massive crystal shuddered, reflecting Lone Blaze's worries, her deep feelings just like a human's. After all, Adam could find another External Artifact if he wished. His refusal was tantamount to death to her and she could not force him.</p><br><p>With palpable confidence, Adam stepped forward, placing a hand on the crystal.</p><br><p>"If Silvana approved you, then I have nothing to fear. In fact, I'm afraid I can't take another foray like this for another External Artifact."</p><br><br><br><p>The crystal trembled again much more violently than before, a bright glow covering the caverns as if a tiny sun was about to be born in the depths.</p><br><p>The dense energy, the pure power of the External Artifact surged in all directions, at such a distance a blast of such force could kill even the Crimson Monarch without leaving a single drop of blood.</p><br><p>But... Adam wasn't nervous. He felt what Lone Blaze did, her anxiety, her awe at their union.</p><br><p>[As you wish... my new master... my first master... and my only master.]</p>
