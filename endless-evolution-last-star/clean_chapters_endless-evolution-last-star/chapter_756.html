            <br><p>The crimson drops flew off her face along with the ripped skin. The impact threw Katrin aside, before she realized it she was submerged in the cold snow enveloping her from all sides.
</p><br><p>Her back only lightly touched the black sand, feeling the unpleasant ice crystals hiding in the gaps.
</p><br><p>A single trickle of blood flowed from the corner of her mouth, her lips actively trembling from the intense pain running in waves throughout her body.
</p><br><p>Her two swords were still clutched tightly in her hands, but it was unknown how long she could continue to hold the hilt until her fingers were numb from the cold.
</p><br><p>"Shit... I was compared to a bug and forcibly thrown out of the fight..."
</p><br><br><p>Katrin slowly touched her wound on the cheek, the chain left a long furrow, an open gash with exposed flesh.
</p><br><p>Her fingertips dipped in her own blood, in a few seconds they would be shrouded in snowflakes, then it would turn into a flat crimson crystal.
</p><br><p>"What a disgusting feeling...."
</p><br><p>Reluctantly, Katrin rose from the ground. Everything in front of her eyes was swirling, she could hardly stand still, constantly shifting her weight from one foot to the other.
</p><br><p>It was only one attack from the Blind Sinner, but... due to her blind rage, she didn’t notice the chain at all.
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord’s fists didn’t seem so crushing, she saw her opponent’s every move, and even if she couldn’t dodge or defend herself, she greatly weakened the force of his blows.
</p><br><p>"Argh... How I wish I could just disappear from here..."
</p><br><p>Katrin held her face with her left hand, her other sword hanging on her belt, letting out frightening darkness, yet she no longer considered herself dangerous.
</p><br><p>"What a fucking shame."
</p><br><p>All the while, Alan was saying something to her, but the Blind Sinner’s swing of the chain hurt her ears, Katrin didn’t realize it, but she had a brain concussion - if the Blind Sinner’s attack was stronger, one of the chain links might well blow her head off.
</p><br><p>Everything in front of her eyes was blurred, but gradually she managed to discern two silhouettes, one standing confidently on its spot, while the other moved forward at a leisurely pace.
</p><br><p>Several monsters were not far from Katrin, from time to time they looked in her direction, she was weakened, but no one dared to attack her.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Her black coat, her Initial Order was actively shivering, quickly changing its shape to save its mistress from the cold.
</p><br><p>In a few seconds, using Katrin’s energy reserves, the coat became slightly longer but most importantly tighter, and less loose. Where before her coat was perfect for hiding from the rain or withstanding the harsh wind currents, now it was her little shelter from the cold.
</p><br><p>"Oh, it’s suddenly warmer..." Katrin’s lips quivered, deep inside she understood everything, but she was too exhausted. It would take a few minutes for her to come to her senses, for now, her only protector was her coat.
</p><br><br><p>Paying no attention to the Phantoms trying to regain consciousness, the Blind Sinner stood in front of the Dormant Lord, a few meters away from the winner of the first round.
</p><br><p>Neither of them could talk like humans, but brutal and aura was more than enough.
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord pointed at Katrin, then he tilted his head slightly, full of confusion.
</p><br><p>’Why did you do that?’ he asked.
</p><br><p>In response, the Blind Sinner shrugged and swung his sword toward the fortress.
</p><br><p>Only the two of them now had the right to decide anything in this territory. The victory of one of them would determine the future of thousands of monsters and hundreds of Phantoms.
</p><br><p>For a while, the Dormant Lord remained silent, then his silhouette trembled as he appeared to the right of the Blind Sinner.
</p><br><p>It was the same attack that Katrin endured dozens of times. She blocked the Dormant Lord’s strikes time after time, trying to absorb the devastating impact.
</p><br><p>And... the Blind Sinner followed suit.
</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, the Blind Sinner raised his sword to his right, taking the Dormant Lord’s fist.
</p><br><p>A slight shiver ran through his body, but the Dormant Lord was not impressed, his posture showing disappointment that his new opponent was no different from the previous one.
</p><br><br><p>A second fist immediately appeared in front of the Blind Sinner’s face, wanting to throw him back as it happened to Katrin several times.
</p><br><p>With a careless expression, the Blind Sinner jerked his head sharply to the left, the Dormant Lord’s fist swept next to his neck, parting the wind currents with his knuckles.
</p><br><br><p>The Blind Sinner took two deep breaths, cold vapor swept before his eyes, then his left hand turned into a shadow.
</p><br><p>Before the Dormant Lord could realize anything, his body was swept through the freezing vapor, falling straight into a high layer of snow.
</p><br><p>Not once in many episodes could Katrin demonstrate such strength and speed, though... that wasn’t the reason.
</p><br><p>Katrin had enough physical stats to dodge at the last moment and counterattack, she just didn’t have as much confidence as the Blind Sinner.
</p><br><br><p>A pale fist of frosty energy reflected in the Dormant Lord’s crystal covering his face.
</p><br><p>For the first time in a while, a shiver ran through his body as he rolled sharply to the side.
</p><br><br><p>Before he could finish his first move, an ice sword with a thick chain slammed into the ground just a few centimeters from his head.
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the Dormant Lord jumped aside, he wanted to change position and see what his opponent was capable of, but the Blind Sinner was not going to hesitate.

</p><br><br><p>The moment the Dormant Lord’s feet touched the ground, an ice blade of dense frost energy flew from the Blind Sinner’s sword, a broad swing that took him less than a second to complete.
</p><br><p>For a moment, the Dormant Lord shifted his gaze to Katrin standing in the distance. He realized that it was impossible to compare these two, the difference was obvious instantly.
</p><br><p>Soon the light turned into two swift blades, and the Dormant Lord unclenched his fists in his palms.
</p><br><p>A new weapon for a new opponent.</p>
