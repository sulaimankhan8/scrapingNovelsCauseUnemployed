            <br><br><p>The banquet hall doors opened, letting in the figure who was the main star of any wedding, the last and brightest - the bride.</p><br><p>The guests at the tables stopped talking, complete silence fell, their gazes turned to Osana, who, thanks to the servants' efforts, was at her peak.</p><br><p>One look at her was enough for the men to keep their eyes on her. In any other situation, their women would be jealous or hateful towards Osana, but... they just smiled, and like their men admired Osana's beauty.</p><br><p>They realized that all this was for only one man - Osana's groom, who was already waiting for her at the very end of the banquet hall.</p><br><br><p>Osana slowly stepped forward while two maids held the ends of her long, lush dress.</p><br><p>Nirosh, her groom, stood on the platform, next to the massive golden arch. His back was straight, a beaming gaze of delight and a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>Behind him, a little to his right, stood a middle-aged woman in formal attire.</p><br><p>That was the officiant, a person required to observe all formalities, for the most part, it was tradition since no one would claim that a wedding between nobles was not official.</p><br><p>Nirosh cast a quick glance at Osana and blinked a few times fascinated by Osana's appearance before directing his gaze forward, waiting for her to reach the golden arch.</p><br><p>Mariel and Zarot glanced over before nodding and smiling contentedly. Everything went exactly as they intended. There were no problems, and each act went on as scheduled.</p><br><p>Not that anything was surprising about that, since that was how most noble weddings passed, but it was always nice when there were no issues.</p><br><p>Istrid looked at her brother and nodded deeply. It wasn't obvious on her face, but she was happy for her brother as well as the development of her family. Each wedding was a crucial union, allowing the great families to strengthen their position in the eternal domination for the top of the Citadel.</p><br><p>Reinal understood how Osana felt, but unlike her, he didn't think it was a tragedy. Such events were part of their lives as nobles, they should accept it and adapt rather than fight.</p><br><p>'Good, looks like I was worried for nothing.'</p><br><p>Reinal nodded deeply, pondering.</p><br><p>'Osana is clever and cunning, but it's impossible to refuse a completed wedding and retain total freedom. I believe she's thought it over properly and realized that it's the best option in this situation.'</p><br><p>Reinal nodded a few more times, trying to convince himself of his own words.</p><br><p>'Yes, that's exactly what happened. Agh, I guess I'll need to apologize to her later for my mistrust. Although, my suspicions are simultaneously a compliment to her intelligence, right?'</p><br><p>Second by second, step by step, and soon Nirosh smelled a pleasant scent incomparable to anything else, then his bride appeared in front of him.</p><br><p>Osana remained calm, her face was slightly serious and collected, she wasn't going to put on a fake smile and show false joy as her mother skillfully did.</p><br><p>It didn't bother Nirosh, he knew what kind of warrior spirit Osana had, so he just accepted her as she was. After all, he realized that was one of the main reasons why he liked her so much and why he wanted to make her his wife.</p><br><p>The officiant, a middle-aged woman let out a slight sigh before confidently saying.</p><br><p>"The bride and groom are in place, now dear guests, it is time to begin the wedding ceremony between Nirosh Marzo and Osana De Rouzet."</p><br><br><p>A waiter approached one of the tables near the platform. The man and woman motioned for the waiter to leave as they didn't need anything.</p><br><p>They wanted to watch the wedding ceremony process for the remaining minutes before the bride and groom became husband and wife.</p><br><br><p>The waiter didn't have a tray in his hands.</p><br><p>Instead of offering the guests wine or appetizers, the waiter simply sat down in an empty seat, at the same table with them.</p><br><p>The man and woman's eyes went wide, this was something they hadn't expected.</p><br><p>The waiter took one appetizer from the table, then a handful of olives, and popped it all into his mouth, watching the marriage procedure as if he were one of the guests.</p><br><p>If this had taken place a few minutes ago, the man and woman would loudly express their displeasure, but... now, no one dared to make even a sound.</p><br><p>In response, Gladius, with a wide smile on his face, turned to the man and skillfully using sign language, said:</p><br><p>'The ceremony is going well, what a pity it's all an illusion, it's not going to happen.'</p><br><p>The man raised an eyebrow in confusion, but his lady knew a bit of sign language and roughly understood what Gladius meant. Discover stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>She didn't know why, but for some reason, she felt that Gladius's words were true. Her face turned pale, her eyes filled with panic and... despair as she realized there was nothing she could do.</p><br><p>If she tried to say anything or interrupt the ceremony, she would be executed before she could blink.</p><br><p>With each officiant's words, seconds slipped away, gradually flowing into the minutes of formal speeches necessary to honor tradition.</p><br><p>However, even such tedious and long speeches came to an end.</p><br><p>"Now, before the bride and groom exchange vows and rings."</p><br><p>The officiant said gravely, running her gaze around the banquet hall.</p><br><p>"I want to ask, is anyone among the guests against this union? If anyone objects?"</p><br><p>Only silence followed, it was just a formality that no one ever answered, it was simply an integral part of any wedding.</p><br><p>"In that case." The woman turned to Nirosh, "Groom, you may begin with your vows to your bride."</p><br><p>Nirosh's eyes sparkled, as he took a deep breath, gaining strength before this important moment.</p><br><br><p>There was a long, loud creak from the opening gate to the banquet hall.</p><br><p>That was something that shouldn't be happening since the last person to enter the banquet hall should be the bride.</p><br><p>"No... He doesn't need to say anything..."</p><br><p>A calm voice echoed from a tall figure slowly stepping forward, leaving muddy footprints from his massive boots on the white cloth the bride was walking on just a few minutes ago.</p><br><p>That couldn't help but make all the guests turn around, paying attention to someone else besides the bride and groom.</p><br><p>"Since I'm against it. This wedding is not going to happen."</p><br><p>Adam confidently said stopping in the middle of the banquet hall. His voice was calm and even quiet, but was indistinguishable from the deafening thunder in the clear sky, devouring all the hopes of those who expected to see the wedding end.</p><br><br><p>A powerful torrent of wind came through the open gate, fluttering Adam's hair tips before his deep, tired blue eyes.</p><br><br><p>With a sharp sweep of his arm, Adam grabbed himself by his right shoulder, ripping the cape off the rivets and throwing it high up so everyone could see the Eight Blades, the emblem of the Balo Family.</p><br><p>His deal with Franz Balo was complete, but here was a person whose last wish Adam was obliged to fulfill.</p><br><p>"I've arrived, Osana."</p><br><p>Adam said confidently, with his gaze fixed only on her.</p><br><br><p>Adam's voice grew heavier and colder, like an order that could not be broken.</p><br><p>"You will be mine by The Rule of Power!"</p>
