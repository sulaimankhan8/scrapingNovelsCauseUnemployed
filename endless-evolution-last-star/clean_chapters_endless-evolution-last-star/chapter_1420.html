            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1420: Only One Beast</strong></p><br><p>Although the Hybrids had abilities similar to those of Phantoms and monsters, the number of their abilities was quite limited, even compared to monsters, not to mention the Phantoms.</p><br><p>Moreover, most of a Hybrid’s energy was directed toward maintaining its physical strength rather than its abilities. After all, they did not have a weapon, so their energy had nowhere to go but into their muscles and bones.</p><br><p>Usually, this was not a disadvantage. It was simply a feature that perfectly complemented their fighting style. Moreover, each Hybrid had a trump card — the Solar Form, which basically allowed them to reach their limits in terms of energy, physical strength, reflexes, and instincts.</p><br><p>But if the power from the Solar Form wasn’t enough, then a Hybrid would start to have problems. A Phantom could keep some ability as a trump card, a monster could do the same, but not a Hybrid.</p><br><p>After Anelez used the Solar Form, she bet everything on this move and ended up losing. Even if she had somehow become even stronger, she would not have been able to survive Adam’s black threads. Most likely, it would have ended with a single thread, possibly her death.</p><br><p>It seemed that the same situation had happened with Erada. Sure, she was stronger than Anelez, she proved it, but she was barely holding out against Adam’s onslaught and his shots. All her abilities and trump cards came to an end while Adam still had several unused powers.</p><br><p>Well… All of that was true, except that Erada had just created another trump card for herself in the middle of their fight.</p><br><p>Her Solar Form had evolved. It was a barrier that Anelez had hoped to break through. Even Xander wasn’t sure that either of them could achieve that during the fight, but… Erada did it.</p><br><p>Her pupils in the sun sign were clear proof of that, as was her calm aura that contrasted sharply with Adam’s raging one.</p><br><p>“Agh…” Erada exhaled cold air, despite the heat coming from her body, onto the wisps of steam around her.</p><br><p>For a moment, she looked away as her and Xander’s eyes met. He nodded slightly, showing his approval. Earning his praise was a difficult task, Erada knew that.</p><br><p>‘We, the Hybrids, are different from everyone else, but that’s what we wanted. That’s why we chose this path, so…’</p><br><br><p>The black thread flying straight at Erada interrupted her thought. She had to dodge, do it right now.</p><br><br><br><p>She grabbed the black thread like an arrow, as its quivering tip stopped right in front of her calm face.</p><br><p>A trickle of blood opened on her palm, flowing through her fingers — it was a small price to pay for what she had just done.</p><br><p>“This girl…” Helasa’s voice trembled. “A minute ago, that thread would have blown her head off!”</p><br><p>Xander nodded. “Exactly. Everything would have happened as you predicted, it would have been a bloody scene. The thread would have torn her hand apart, then she would have lost her head and her life. However, now that’s impossible. She has become much stronger, and Adam will have to find a way to become stronger if he wants to survive.”</p><br><p>He expected Helasa to complain or exclaim, but instead she just crossed her arms over her chest and shrugged.</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Xander hummed. “Did I say something wrong?”</p><br><p>“Yeah.” She confirmed. “The reward for this fight will allow Adam to become stronger. His situation is different from Anelez and Erada’s, who decided to fight him to break through the barrier. You know, he needs the Dark Heart, which is why he is participating in the Rule of Blood and agreed to your plan.”</p><br><br><p>“But he doesn’t need to become stronger. The black threads he used? The ability that put Erada in mortal danger and forced her to evolve? That was a power he simply hadn’t touched since his past progress. Do you really think that’s all he has?”</p><br><p>Xander’s eyes widened in realization. He understood that Anelez, Erada, or any other Hybrid comparable to them in strength had little chance of defeating Adam. When Erada’s Solar Form evolved, he rejoiced because he was sure that now Erada would be victorious.</p><br><p>But… Helasa’s words made him doubt that.</p><br><p>‘Adam Vinter…’ Xander muttered inwardly. ‘Helasa is so confident in you, even though she can’t know what you’re really capable of. So, could it be that even what Erada did won’t be enough to defeat a Phantom like you?’</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>Erada’s grip tightened as the black thread shattered into fragments, flying past her calm eyes.</p><br><p>At the same moment, electric discharges shot toward her feet as she vanished.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, she appeared before Adam, who was ready for this. With a broad grin, he swung his threads, raining down a hail of white whips upon her.</p><br><p>“That’s not enough…” Erada muttered, stepping forward.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened as all the threads hung around Erada. In the next moment, electric discharges ran through the whips, tearing them to pieces.</p><br><p>Before the pieces could reach the ground, Erada took a step forward and found herself in front of Adam. Her unusual pupils had a mesmerizing effect on Adam, as if wanting to plunge him into hypnosis.</p><br><p>“Thank you,” she said, reaching out her hand to Adam’s chest. “I wanted to fight you as soon as I heard about a Phantom like Adam Vinter. When I found out you had arrived in Izardo, I was beside myself with joy. It didn’t happen right away, but we managed to meet on the battlefield, and I did it because I knew it was what I needed.”</p><br><br><p>Her claws sank into Adam’s chest, slowly piercing his skin and moving straight toward his heart.</p><br><p>“However, now we are on different levels. You must understand that.”</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Adam grabbed Erada’s wrist as shock covered her face. The strength of his grip was more than she expected. She couldn’t move her arm.</p><br><p>“What do you think you are…?” A strange voice, as if doubled, came from Adam.</p><br><p>Erada gulped as she watched the darkness thicken around him, causing her calm heart to beat faster again as a chill ran down her spine.</p><br><p>‘What… What is this?’</p>
