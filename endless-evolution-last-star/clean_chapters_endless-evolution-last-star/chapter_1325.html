            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1325: Silver Beacon</strong></p><br><p>For several minutes, Norax and Narica stood silently atop the mill, their only companion the gentle breeze that kept them from getting bored.</p><br><p>Slowly, Narica looked toward the unusual structure that was very different from anything else at the Forgotten Mills. Even Norax’s mill couldn’t compare, because it wasn’t a mill.</p><br><p>Five white blades, like hands reaching out of the ground, pointed their tips toward the sky. In the very center, amid a snow-white field, stood a majestic beacon with a bright, almost blinding star burning at its top.</p><br><p>Adam had seen this structure in his fragments and satellite photos when he and Silvana were looking for a place where a monster suitable for battle could be found. The beacon was visible in the very corner of the photos, so when Adam arrived at the Forgotten Mills, he completely forgot about it because other tasks appeared before him.</p><br><p>However, it was quite possible that he would soon find himself there if Norax, who had been preparing him for this to some extent, decided so.</p><br><p>“Sir, do you really want to send this young man to the Silver Beacon?”</p><br><br><p>“Why not? I don’t think there will be a better option in the next seven years. Moreover, considering who Adam is, the Silver Beacon should accept him in any case. You know better than anyone that in this case, quality is much more important than quantity.”</p><br><p>Narica nodded slightly.</p><br><p>“But, even if that’s the case, sir… Adam has a fiery temper, and it’s obvious that the Silver Beacon likes his risky and reckless nature. Do you think that will be enough?”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Norax shook his head.</p><br><p>“No, it won’t be enough, not for him, not for Ureyn, not for anyone else.”</p><br><p>This puzzled Narica. She didn’t understand why Norax had mentioned it then.</p><br><p>He grinned. “You haven’t forgotten why Adam came here, have you?”</p><br><p>“S-Sure, the Connected Heart. If for monsters it is not a necessity but simply a bonus on our long journey, then a Phantom cannot reach the limit of the K4-Level without passing the Path Construct.”</p><br><p>As an experienced monster, she knew that the Connected Heart was a requirement for most K4-Phantoms. It didn’t necessarily have to be a requirement in the First or Second Grand Star, but most often it appeared at some stage.</p><br><p>It was logical because every Phantom received its first abilities and power after killing a monster, and every monster had an origin. Some were common, while others were rarer.</p><br><p>“Exactly. He arranged the String Duel for this, and it seems that’s not all he needs. I sense the energy of the Midnight and Twilight Crystals in him. He absorbed them some time ago, and I also know that he defeated Bathild, the lightning monster near the Dark Shore.”</p><br><p>Taking a short sip of his coffee, Norax continued:</p><br><p>“Obviously, he got his lightning sword after defeating that monster. I think that’s when he revealed the Memory Fragment.”</p><br><p>Narica looked at him uncertainly.</p><br><p>“Sir, what do you mean?”</p><br><br><p>“That I don’t sense the power of the Hybrid in him, as well as something else. I think you already understand what I’m talking about. He is obviously at the Second Grand Star, in the process of its creation, so his Energy Axis had to appear as soon as he fulfilled one of several conditions.”</p><br><p>Despite Norax’s hints, Narica wasn’t sure what he meant. Her lips trembled as her eyes suddenly widened.</p><br><p>“W-Wait! Sir, do you think his next condition is either the Dark Heart or the Desire of Beyond?”</p><br><p>“Hahaha! I don’t think so, I know it!” He laughed loudly.</p><br><p>She tilted her head in confusion.</p><br><p>“Agh? What are you talking about?”</p><br><p>He spread his arms wide. “What can I say. While Misty and Karso remained in the chamber and waited for him to awaken, I secretly snuck in there. I didn’t want them to know about it because I wanted to be as discreet as possible.</p><br><p>“So… I was able to get a glimpse at his inner space and at the Path Construct. I saw three bright points and a pattern familiar to me. Add to that the previous facts, and I’m willing to bet that his next two targets are either the Dark Heart or the Desire of Beyond.”</p><br><p>Narica’s face paled as she realized what Norax had done.</p><br><p>“Sir! Forgive me, but that was reckless! One mistake, one fluctuation in your aura, and your energy would have torn him to pieces!”</p><br><p>He chuckled. “Hah! That’s the whole point! Although… I was almost spotted.”</p><br><p>“WHAT!?” Narica exclaimed in disbelief, not only because of how dangerous Norax’s actions were, but also because someone was able to spot him when he was in complete stealth mode.</p><br><p>Then, Norax’s eyes darkened as he recalled the events that had taken place about a month and a half ago, two weeks after Adam and Ureyn’s battle.</p><br><p>“It wasn’t his Evolution Tree, Operator, or even his External Artifact hidden within his Initial Gene. But it was that lightning sword and his Path Construct. I don’t know what it was exactly, maybe there was a connection between them or maybe it was just a coincidence, but an electric discharge came out of the sword — straight towards me.”</p><br><p>He waved his hand, indicating that there was nothing to worry about.</p><br><p>“Sure, as soon as it happened, I immediately left his Inner Space, but I didn’t think anything like that could happen. If it were another Phantom, I could calmly walk in front of his Evolution Tree and remain invisible.”</p><br><p>“That means his Path Construct or sword is very powerful, right?”</p><br><p>In response, Norax nodded deeply as he looked toward the Silver Beacon.</p><br><p>“Yeah, something like that. We’ll only know for sure in the future. What’s important now is that he knows how to get the Dark Heart, for which he must fight a Hybrid, but the Desire of Beyond remains a mystery to him.”</p><br><p>He grinned in anticipation.</p><br><p>“That’s what will help him at the Silver Beacon, as it will all of us to some extent. Treasures for everyone, monsters and humans! That is our path!”</p>
