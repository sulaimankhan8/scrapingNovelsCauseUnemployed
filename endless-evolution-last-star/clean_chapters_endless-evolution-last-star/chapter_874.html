            <br><p>Silvana and Adam glanced at each other in surprise.</p><br><p>They had expected to cuddle in bed for several hours at minimum, well at least Silvana had.</p><br><p>However, instead, they found themselves in Adam's inner space, both of them. For Silvana, it was the first time she had ever been in this exact place.</p><br><p>Sure, when she helped Adam in the battle against the Crimson Monarch and took over his wound, then she was in the inner space, but that space belonged to her. There was no Evolution Tree there, only her Evolution Sprout.</p><br><p>She looked around with interest, looking at the artifact that had been changed thanks to her star, at Adam's Nexus, and of course at the Evolution Tree itself.</p><br><p>Soon, a powerful voice from outside rang out:</p><br><p>[Congratulations... You decided to do it after all...]</p><br><p>After a short pause, the Evolution Tree added:</p><br><p>[It's not for me to judge good or bad... but it was an important event, for all of us...]</p><br><p>Adam turned around abruptly, staring intently at the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>"Hey, what the hell is going on here? Why did Silvana get into my inner space? Why is the energy affecting both of us? And... What the hell is that?" Adam pointed to the first lesser gates, they were shaking more and more with each passing second.</p><br><p>He was anxious. Often when events involved energy, it didn't end well for Silvana.</p><br><p>[Don't worry... Silvana would be here anyway... regardless of whether your relationship would change or not...]</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam was confused, "What are you talking about?"</p><br><p>[Hehehe... It's simple my young friend... The Crystal Gates are divided into five lesser gates, there are five more orbs ahead of you... There is a certain condition for each one... so... you just fulfilled one of them...]</p><br><p>Puzzlement reflected on Adam's face, he didn't realize what exactly he had done.</p><br><p>"Wait, to open the first gate I had to... sleep with my Operator?" Adam gulped, he struggled to make that assumption.</p><br><p>Silvana blushed as she shyly looked away. She made no secret of the fact that she wanted to do it herself, but... to her, the Evolution Tree was a stranger. It was embarrassing.</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree actively laughed like an old man watching a naive young man.</p><br><p>[I told you it had nothing to do with that... or rather it was just a catalyst... Not all the Phantoms open the first lesser gates after a night with their Operator, after all... not everyone gets to that level of relationship...]</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana exchanged glances. There was no doubt in them about each other's intentions, but the Evolution Tree's words were, as always, full of mystery.</p><br><p>[For the first lesser gates to come into motion, the Phantom must reach a certain point of trust with its Operator... the way is unimportant... whether it's a contract, love, sex, or a strong working relationship as battle buddies... maybe even all together... like I said there are no limits...]</p><br><p>"But..." Adam was stumped, "What about the Gene Diffusion? And... that trick Silvana did to heal my left arm in the fortress. Isn't all that proof of our trust in each other?"</p><br><p>If the Evolution Tree could, it would nod in affirmation.</p><br><p>[Sure... There's no doubt about it... but... didn't you both feel something new when you woke up after your night out?]</p><br><p>Silvana and Adam should have been embarrassed, but instead, they were surprised because they knew what the Evolution Tree was talking about.</p><br><p>Silvana looked down, her palm pressed to her chest.</p><br><p>"Yes... I had a relief unlike anything I've had before, but I thought it had to do with my feelings for Adam," she murmured.</p><br><p>"I too..." Adam said.</p><br><p>[One does not exclude the other... So in your case, it was what you needed to activate the first lesser gates... I think you've already realized that Operators remain mere humans, assistants only at the K0 and K1 Levels.]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree added:</p><br><p>[Then... things start to change... The first step was the Gene Diffusion, then the Pain Transition, and now it's time for the first lesser gates...]</p><br><p>That got Adam thinking - the changes had been happening for a while now, not only to him but to Silvana as well.</p><br><p>'Right... Silvana can not only use the Pain Transition, if necessary she can enhance herself with energy, luckily there has been no need for that yet, as well as the shared sight. Hmm... the Operator's Star isn't exactly an ability, but it's made me stronger.'</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, confirming his thoughts.</p><br><p>'That's right, even if she can use a little of my energy to get stronger, most of her abilities are geared towards making me stronger.'</p><br><p>A slight smile appeared on Adam's face. Deep down inside he would not want Silvana as a high-ranked Operator to become the second unit in their alliance.</p><br><p>He was already no longer a normal human and had become a Phantom, both physically and mentally. He didn't want at some point in their journey, Silvana to be forced to go to the Dead Lands and fight against monsters like he did.</p><br><p>Adam didn't know what capabilities the Operators of the K3, K4, and even more so of the Second Rank Phantoms possessed.</p><br><p>Yet, he had his guesses and he wanted Silvana to remain his support, the support that any worthy Operator should be.</p><br><p>'Hah...' Adam grinned inwardly, admiring Silvana's pensive face, 'I can fight for both of us, I hope she doesn't have to.'</p><br><p>Then, he looked at his hand, slowly clenching his fist.</p><br><p>'However... If Silvana can make me stronger, that's fine by me. The way she changed my artifact, that's a whole new level of ability.'</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a shudder sounded from the first lesser gates behind them.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana turned around, the Evolution Tree was staring intently at the first orb.</p><br><p>[Go ahead... You're both here because you're ready... The first orb is somewhat unique... it requires exposure to both the Operator and the Phantom...]</p><br><p>"Shall we?" Adam glanced at Silvana.</p><br><p>"Ughum..." Silvana nodded slightly uncertainly.</p><br><p>It was unusual for her to be in Adam's inner space. There was only darkness around, she was floating in the air, yet she could feel a solid surface beneath her feet.</p><br><p>She could descend a little lower or higher if she wished, as if on imaginary stairs.</p><br><p>'How unusual...' Silvana turned around, 'When I was in my little inner space I just didn't have time to properly explore everything... by the way...'</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes sparkled as if she had remembered something important.</p><br><p>"Hey, Adam..." she turned to him, "Where's Lone Blaze? I'd like to talk to her."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in mild curiosity.</p><br><br><p>Then, he pointed to the center of his Evolution Tree, at the Initial Gene.</p><br><p>"Sure, she's there, along with Moira." Adam stepped forward as he waved his hand, "Hey, Lone Blaze, you heard Silvana, come here."</p><br><p>The Initial Gene shuddered, but no one came outside, it seemed that Lone Blaze was afraid to meet Silvana.</p><br><p>Well, that couldn't please Adam.</p><br><p>He narrowed his eyes menacingly and pointed downward.</p><br><p>"I said come here, you flaming witch."</p><br><p>Then, a bright red star flew out of Adam's initial gene, leaving the right side empty. Lone Blaze didn't want to do this, for her own reasons, but she just couldn't ignore Adam's order.</p><br><p>After all, she swore her loyalty to him, this was his inner space, his dominion, that had become her new home.</p><br><p>With a brief flash, Lone Blaze appeared before Silvana.</p><br><p>She tried to look as confident and arrogant as ever, but her darting eyes gave away that she was nervous.</p><br><p>Adam had made it clear that she and Moira were last on the list of influences in their alliance, Silvana was far above.</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply and stepped forward to meet Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>Their gazes met - Silvana's serious gaze made Lone Blaze gulp.</p><br><p>'Fuck...' Lone Blaze internally muttered, 'She looks angry, very angry! Although... that's not surprising considering what I did the last time.'</p><br><p>Maybe I should run away? - Lone Blaze's first thought, but she quickly pushed the idea aside.</p><br><p>One way or another, Adam would force her to face Silvana.</p><br><br><p>With the last step, Silvana stopped. She stared intently into Lone Blaze's fiery eyes as if trying to pierce her with her gaze.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze's fingers trembled, she was preparing for the worst.</p><br><p>Silvana clenched her fists tightly.</p><br><p>Then, she bowed low before Lone Blaze almost touching the ground with her forehead.</p><br><p>"Thank you so much for helping me that time! Without the Pain Transition, I wouldn't have been able to save Adam!"</p><br><p>Lone Blaze's mouth opened wide, if her chin could have then it would have collapsed to the ground.</p><br><p>"I... Don't... I was just doing my job!" Lone Blaze quickly exclaimed waving her hands.</p><br><p>This unexpected turn for her made her embarrassed which was rare for her.</p><br><p>"Please stand up... I don't deserve your praise, then... I was rather cruel."</p><br><p>Watching this scene, Adam smiled bitterly. He felt as if he was watching the children in a large family.</p><br><p>After that, he looked at the first lesser gates.</p><br><p>'Hm... A new ability for the two of us, right? That's good, but what's behind the other orbs?'</p>
