            <br><p>It constantly seemed like there was something wrong with Alexia. She looked like a sweet girl, with a bright smile and an innocent, neatly styled ponytail. However, her phrasing was completely out of character from time to time.</p><br><p>Then, everyone could understand the reason for this, for it wasn't because of Alexia's, strange temperament, but because of the mask, she wore until that moment.</p><br><br><p>Alexia smacked herself in the chest as all the coldness headed into her body, making her skin, first, completely pale and then even slightly blue. Her hair shone brightly just as her eyes changed color from green to azure.</p><br><p>"So bastard, are you ready? You have exactly three minutes. If you can last them, you'll win, but... I sure as hell doubt it!" Alexia exclaimed with an excited expression before tearing forward at tremendous speed.</p><br><p>Her silhouette blurred, and every step she took, left cracks in the ice.</p><br><p>Frost Beast's eyes moved quickly from one point to another, trying to keep track of Alexia, constantly changing her position.</p><br><p>Then, a cold vapor came out of the tubes on her gloves, and several streaks shone brightly as if liquid nitrogen was flowing through them.</p><br><p>"Suck it!" Alexia shouted at the moment, finding herself right in front of Frost Beast.</p><br><p>Before Frost Beast could realize anything, Alexia's fist came down on the monster's head, creating a powerful ice blast that froze even the air around it.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Vibrations traveled through the monster's large body, only for the momentum to eventually throw Frost Beast backwards. It was only one meter, but considering the size of Frost Beast and Alexia, it was an incredible result.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, is that the best you can do? Go! Show the power of the 6th Rank!" Alexia smirked, attacking again and again.</p><br><p>She wasn't going to stop, delivering a hail of blows each creating a small ice blast.</p><br><p>After she used her Second Order and channeled the cold into her body, she became both, faster and stronger, almost reaching Resonance level without entering Resonance. It was just her ability.</p><br><p>The ice blasts upon strikes were a result of her First Nexus Trait and would last for some time until the frost energy ran out.</p><br><p>However, the most important thing was the change in Alexia's behavior. She became more aggressive, less concerned with her defense, and more focused on being able to deal as much damage as possible.</p><br><p>Normally, this would be the wrong fighting style, but considering Alexia had become much stronger for a short period, it was the best option.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Punch after punch, Alexia's fists tore chunks of flesh away from the Frost Beast. Droplets of blood rushed outward, pouring down Alexia's belligerent face.</p><br><p>Sure, even her ice blasts couldn't seriously damage Frost Beast's hide, however... All she had to do was get to the monster's flesh, freezing it to the point that it fell away from the body.</p><br><p>"Come on! Show me what you can do! I'm getting bored!" Alexia exclaimed before jumping at the Frost Beast.</p><br><p>She grabbed the monster's horn with one hand, thus she could clutch the monster's eye with her other hand.</p><br><p>Then, with an insane grin, she with a sharp movement of her hand, ripped out the right eye of the Frost Beast, flooding her body with a stream of blood.</p><br><p>"RRRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!!" </p><br><p>The pitiful roar spread for hundreds of meters, instilling fear and terror, not only in the humans but also in the monsters. However, it was not the roar that was frightening, but its cause, for if Frost Beast roared in pain, then his opponent was an even bigger monster.</p><br><br><p>Alexia grasped Frost Beast's horn tightly, quickly breaking it and ripping it out of the monster's head along with a piece of hide and flesh that was quickly torn from the body with strings of veins and blood vessels.</p><br><p>However, this time, Frost Beast did not growl in pain, since the monster had already realized that he had to give up everything for a chance to win.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the bone rings on his thick tail began to shatter, releasing the ice crystals hidden beneath them all along.</p><br><p>Then, Frost Beast swept its tail to the ground, causing dozens of crystals with sharp spikes to appear. They were growing in random directions, but there were so many of them that Alexia was immediately under attack.</p><br><p>Alexia's pupils narrowed as she jumped back, turning in midair.</p><br><p>Several crystals left scratches on her sides and shoulders, but none managed to pierce her. In fact, Alexia remained largely unharmed.</p><br><p>"Hah, not bad, but what next? Will you summon more crystals? I can easily dodge them or destroy them!" Alexia swung her hand sharply, smashing the nearest crystal with her fist.</p><br><p>The crystal was several times larger than her, but it shattered into tiny shards, practically turning to dust. The crystals were sharp, but also quite fragile.</p><br><br><p>Frost Beast began to thump the ground with his massive tail.</p><br><p>However, no new crystals appeared, though Alexia was ready for it. Only after a while did she realize what Frost Beast was actually doing.</p><br><p>"Shit..." Alexia muttered, looking at the waves of monsters moving towards her. They were pretty much all the monsters the Left North Squad was fighting.</p><br><p>Every time Frost Beast's tail hit the ground, it caused vibrations that attracted more and more monsters. Moreover, when the blue waves from the vibrations passed through the monsters, they would become a bit stronger and faster, advancing to the next stage of power.</p><br><p>Alexia was strong, but even she would have problems if she had to fight hundreds of monsters at once.</p><br><p>The problem wasn't even that she might fail. No, she would definitely kill as many Snow Imots, Horned Lizards, and Azure Wolves as necessary. However, she would waste valuable time doing so, because, after a few minutes, the effects of her Second Order would start to fade away.</p><br><p>Then, she would hardly have enough strength to defeat Frost Beast. Well, unless she entered Resonance, but she couldn't count on that.</p><br><p>The Phantoms were about to help her, but soon they stopped, from the intense cold that with the wind currents reached even them. It was an unusual cold, and one filled with energy, for it was the only way the Phantoms could begin to freeze, just like normal humans.</p><br><p>"Decided to call your friends for help? Fine, then I'll kill everyone right here and now!" Alexia exclaimed before placing her wrists against each other with her palms upright.</p><br><p>Then, all the lines on her gloves shone brightly, and a dense frost began to run down the tubes, coming out of the inner gaps on her wrists.</p><br><p>The icy vapor turned into a tiny ring, but it was as cold as a frosted star, lowering the temperature to a minimum.</p><br><p>"Absolute zero..." Alexia whispered before moving her hands away from each other, thus allowing the ring to expand and spread hundreds of meters around like a shockwave.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, each monster turned into an ice statue as if time had stopped for them, and Frost Beast was no exception. Through the open wound in his head, his brain froze, plunging him into eternal darkness, cold and lonely.</p>
