            <br><br><p>Katrin took a step back, she and the Dormant Lord intuitively paused briefly in their fierce battle.
</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."
</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Katrin raised her gaze upwards towards the spire. Strangely enough, the Dormant Lord did the same, his instincts telling him that there was no way to ignore this event.
</p><br><p>"Alan... What the hell is going on here? Another problem?"
</p><br><p>In response, she heard the uncertain voice of her Operator, for this one mission alone, Alan was confused more times than he was in the past two months:
</p><br><p>’It’s... Some monster climbed to the top of the spire and blocked the flow of flame, but I don’t know why or who could do it...’
</p><br><p>Before Katrin could say anything, Alan interrupted her in a worried way:
</p><br><p>’Wait! It’s one of the three Commanders! Right now at the top of the spire is the Blind Commander, I don’t know what he’s going to do with the flames but I don’t think it’s good news for us!’
</p><br><p>Katrin’s eyes went wide, she was baffled.
</p><br><p>"What? You said that the Unknown Phantom who came here before the others defeated all the Commanders! That was our main advantage!"
</p><br><p>Under Katrin’s furious Katrin’s voice Alan gulped, he could sense that the new problems didn’t please her at all.
</p><br><p>’Looks like either this Phantom or its Operator made a mistake and somehow the Blind Commander survived.’
</p><br><p>Trying to reassure Katrin in some way, Alan spoke quickly:
</p><br><p>’I’ve already reported this to everyone else. Right now there are a lot of Phantoms trying to get to the top of the spire to stop the Blind Commander.
</p><br><p>However, Katrin was not impressed by this.
</p><br><br><p>Katrin shook her head with a dark face.
</p><br><p>"They won’t make it in time. Fuck, I can barely deal with one bastard, but no sooner did I solve the first problem than the second one already appeared, no good..."
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Suddenly a powerful pressure fell on Katrin, but not from the spire or the Blind Commander, the cause was the Dormant Lord, his aura intensified dramatically.
</p><br><p>The monster turned in her direction before becoming a deadly flash rushing straight at her.
</p><br><br><p>Katrin took a step back in shock, preparing to block the lightning attack.
</p><br><p>It was unknown what the matter was, but it was very much like the Dormant Lord was in a hurry to defeat Katrin as soon as possible.
</p><br><p>’This is weird...’ Katrin muttered to herself, ’Shouldn’t I be the one in a hurry? What the hell is going on here? Why does that bastard know more than me?’
</p><br><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.
</p><br><p>Bits of blue flame came out of the cracks, flying in front of the Blind Commander’s face, he purposely left some space, waiting for the flames to reach their peak.
</p><br><p>For any other monster, it would have been suicide, the concentrated stream of blue flames shooting out of the spire would freeze anyone, but the Blind Commander didn’t worry about that.
</p><br><p>He did it because he didn’t want to waste much time.
</p><br><br><p>With a sharp movement of his hand, the Blind Commander turned the hilt of his sword, blocking the last cracks like a key perfectly fitting into a maze.
</p><br><p>Now the flames had no choice but to work their way straight through the Blind Commander.
</p><br><p>The blue fire burst out in a powerful stream, quickly consuming the Blind Commander’s arm and his entire body.
</p><br><p>A layer of thin ice rapidly covered the last commander’s body like a grid, growing thicker and thicker to forever encase him in its frosty embrace.
</p><br><p>Although his silent death was fast approaching, the Blind Commander was in no hurry to escape - everything was under his control. Enjoy new stories from NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, all the flames contained within the spire came out and engulfed the Blind Commander, it lashed in different directions from his body, trying to penetrate him to the depths, but no matter how hard the cold fire tried it failed to turn the Blind Commander into a silent statue.
</p><br><p>If the Blind Commander pulled out the hilt of his sword and stepped aside then perhaps the blue flames would forgive him and let him go, but that was not what the last commander wanted.
</p><br><p>He and the flames had only one option - someone would consume the other and the fire was quickly losing its chances.
</p><br><br><p>Shaking his head one last time, the Blind Commander released his aura, slowly raising the hilt from the hollow in the spire.
</p><br><p>Under his will, blue flames mixed with his energy, he absorbed the energy of the spire, like any monster was capable of absorbing a crystal. Yet, few were able to withstand even a moment in front of the most powerful fire in the Stronghold.
</p><br><p>Gradually, his energy and flames fused, turning into an azure invulnerable veil covering him from all sides.
</p><br><p>With each passing second, the Blind Commander’s aura grew stronger and calmer at the same time. His strength grew not from rage or ability, but from the fact that he was moving to the next level - he was evolving.
</p><br><p>Long dark shadows showed up behind the azure veil, while the Blind Commander’s silhouette changed slightly.
</p><br><br><p>With the next flow of wind, the azure veil dispersed, and the Blind Commander’s aura calmed down, but now it was something completely different from his previous self.
</p><br><br><p>With a crunch of bones, the Blind Commander rose confidently to his feet, while the wide bandages partially fell off his head.
</p><br><p>Thick white hair with spiky tips fell over his forehead as he slowly opened his two large blue eyes. They were brighter and more precious than any gems, a treasure born on top of the coldest peak.
</p><br><p>A few bandages fell just below, revealing his mouth strikingly resembling a human rather than a monster.
</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.
</p><br><p>Long heavy chains hovering nearby quickly curled around his arms, becoming his support and defense, the right chain was much longer continuing its way straight to the hilt.
</p><br><br><p>Under the flow of energy, sharp chunks of ice soared upwards, nothing of significance until the long chain reached them.
</p><br><p>The cold chain clutched the shards tightly, becoming a single piece - turning into a long sword.
</p><br><p>But, this sword did not belong to the Blind Commander, now it was another monster - the Blind Sinner, the one born from the frost at the pinnacle, towering above the others, no more equal in the fortress as it was before.</p>
