            <br><p>It seemed that some moments nothing could ruin.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper was ready to fight against Adam, Osana, and Katrin, just as they were. Fume Armors stood aside as silent spectators, waiting for the fighters to make their next moves.</p><br><p>The gates were firmly closed, making Fume Cathedral an impregnable fortress with no way out except for a hole in the roof, but it was too small and high up, its purpose was to let in the faint moonlight and nothing more.</p><br><p>The hundreds of monsters outside were too scared to come within ten meters of Fume Cathedral. The Fume Statues were loyal guards, not going to let anyone in until the historic battle was over, regardless of its outcome.</p><br><p>The black air and thick fog covering everything around this part of the Fallen Crypt minimized that anyone would come here to interfere with their battle.</p><br><p>Everything was flawless and perfect.</p><br><br><p>Anything could happen in Dead Lands, and spatial anomalies weren't the only proof that this inviolable rule worked.</p><br><p>Midnight Crystal, came out of nowhere, bringing with it not chaos, but a determination of how their battle would proceed.</p><br><p>Fume Cathedral had been in Fallen Crypt for a long period, its construction absorbed massive amounts of dense energy, becoming a truly solid material that most Light Yellow Threat Monsters were unable to break.</p><br><p>However, for Midnight Crystal falling from the heavens, it was like destroying an unstable card house that could break with an excessive sigh.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The ground shook, responding to the power of the Midnight Crystal, drilling its sharp end into the gray earth, leaving a wide trail behind it like the aftermath of an avalanche.</p><br><p>In its path, besides destroying the Fume Cathedral, the Midnight Crystal crashed into several spectator monsters running around the majestic Gothic building, afraid to come any closer to avoid the wrath of the Fume Statues.</p><br><p>Midnight Crystal was a natural phenomenon for which taking someone's life was as plain as making a simple, nameless stone tremble.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The bones of the monsters broke, their tough flesh tearing like weak cloth, forfeiting their lives as the tip of the Midnight Crystal pierced their bodies.</p><br><p>However... This only happened to the particularly strong monsters. The weaker ones simply exploded. The thick streams of energy flowing around the Midnight Crystal put too much pressure on them as they fell.</p><br><p>Adam, Osana, Katrin, and even Plague Reaper... All of them simultaneously gulped, staring wide-eyed at Midnight Crystal who had stopped half-submerged into the ground.</p><br><p>Behind him, Midnight Crystal left only destruction and a long bloody trail made up of dozens of monsters that died simply because they were too close to this majestic object.</p><br><p>Though it was never confirmed, the Citadel assumed that the Midnight Crystals were shards of the Last Star, which was believed to be the beginning of the world in which they lived, both monsters and humans.</p><br><p>Either way, it didn't matter now whether the Citadel scientists' assumption was true or not.</p><br><p>Their hearts were actively beating just by looking at Midnight Crystal, feeling how dense and powerful its energy was.</p><br><p>Earlier, the Prime Thunder Demon had stolen a larva king to eat it and evolve. It was enough for a Top-2.1 monster like him.</p><br><p>For a Plague Reaper, such an array of energy would not be enough to trigger immediate evolution, but... Midnight Crystal was a different matter.</p><br><p>The energy within Midnight Crystal was enough to allow three different Plague Reapers to start evolving, not to mention the other weaker monsters that could even use a shard of it to become much stronger.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a bright fiery flash appeared from above, causing everyone to pay attention.</p><br><p>It was Essence Scarlet Pyromancer, who had finally, after a long time, gotten a chance to escape from this place and immediately took it, not wanting to lose his only chance.</p><br><p>With a few flaps of its massive, heavy chitin-covered wings, Scarlet Pyromancer soared, quickly heading forward.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper raised his eyes upward for a moment, a look of slight surprise in his gaze. Despite being in charge of Fume Cathedral, he hadn't noticed that all this time, Scarlet Pyromancer had been lurking above.</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer was ready to escape when Plague Reaper deflected Erla's blast shot with his palm, but the hole from the explosion was too small.</p><br><p>There was no way Scarlet Pyromancer's massive body would fit through such a hole, but now that Fume Cathedral was partially destroyed, there was more than enough room to break out.</p><br><p>Katrin bit her lip, gritting her teeth she muttered.</p><br><p>"Fuck... Bastard, he decided to escape after all..."</p><br><p>She clenched her fists tightly, staring at the plume of fire that remained after Scarlet Pyromancer, then her gaze returned to Plague Reaper and Midnight Crystal.</p><br><p>"Midnight Crystal...? Are you serious? Shouldn't it only appear in Midnight Zones?" Adam asked sweat came out on his forehead.</p><br><p>He wasn't scared or anxious, but he was excited to a great degree. Like many K1-Phantoms that had already reached their limit, Adam had wished for Midnight Crystal, but he hadn't expected it to happen now.</p><br><p>Midnight Zones were notable for having a higher energy density, many dangerous monsters, anomalies, and unique landscapes. Such places attracted Midnight Crystals and encountering them there was more a matter of time and waiting than luck.</p><br><p>So... why did Midnight Crystal choose this place to fall here? Was there a specific reason?</p><br><p>In any case, the appearance of the Midnight Crystal was like the beginning of a gold fever that consumed the mind of every creature without exception.</p><br><p>Everyone wanted the Midnight Crystal, monsters, and Phantoms, and giving the Midnight Crystal to their enemy was absolutely impossible.</p><br><p>'Adam, the situation has changed a lot, but your goal remains the same.' Silvana said in a serious voice, she gathered her emotions as much as possible in this situation.</p><br><p>'You have to kill Plague Reaper, otherwise, he will absorb Midnight Crystal, and then you definitely won't stand a chance against him.'</p><br><p>Adam was about to say something, but at that moment, the ground actively trembled.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Cracks appeared in various places before streams of purple fire erupted from beneath the ground as if to signify that this place was now a living hell and this was just the beginning.</p>
