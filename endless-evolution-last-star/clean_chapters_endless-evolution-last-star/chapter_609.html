            <br><p>Stones mixed with dust flew aside under the crimson blade's onslaught of destruction, leaving behind a deep cut in the ground as if it were the sword of a giant capable of demolishing the top of a mountain with a single swing of his hand.</p><br><p>It was like the Steel Knight's kinetic blade, but much more powerful, full of aggressive terrifying energy.</p><br><p>Speed, strength, and ferocity were the foundation of the crimson blade that in a heartbeat appeared before its target.</p><br><p>Fromund's eyes went wide, in an instant his weapon was destroyed, the crimson blade simply sliced his spear in two, the flames hastily extinguished without the source of its energy.</p><br><p>Instinctively, he extended his left arm to try and stop the impending disaster, but... it was already too late.</p><br><br><p>A bitter smile appeared on Fromund's face, his deep blue eyes filled with sadness and disappointment.</p><br><p>'It's time to lose, isn't it?'</p><br><br><p>The crimson blade slashed into his right shoulder, slicing through his flesh and quickly reaching the bones beneath the protection that harbored his rapidly beating heart.</p><br><p>The flame armor, sensing the threat, turned into one single stream heading towards the point of impact, covering the space between Fromund's heart and crimson blade.</p><br><p>But... no armor could stop it, the fate of one of the fighters was already sealed, since he reached his limit.</p><br><br><p>With a burst of flames, a powerful stream of blood rushed out from Fromund's chest, pouring onto the ravaged ground in front of him.</p><br><br><p>A deep sigh was all he could manage, watching the bright drops of blood reflecting in his eyes, quickly losing their light.</p><br><p>Bright pain spread through his body, but all Fromund could think about at that moment was defeat, how he failed himself and his sisters... what a mistake he committed.</p><br><br><p>The impact slammed Fromund into the wall with brute force, tearing the flesh on his back, making his heart clench painfully, which was still miraculously unharmed, all his flames could protect only it.</p><br><br><p>Driven by instinct, Fromund took a step forward, climbing out of the wall, with a weary, exhausted look at his opponent standing in the distance.</p><br><p>A wide cut at the length of the arena separated them, like a chasm to fall into would be the end for any living creature.</p><br><p>All eyes without exception went to him, to his blood-drenched body, a horrible gash in the right side of his chest and cracked bones, his heart was visible through the torn flesh.</p><br><p>"Why... Why are you all looking at me like that...? I just wanted to win..."</p><br><br><p>With a thud, Fromund fell to the ground, a shudder raised dust before settling down again.</p><br><br><p>No one said anything, not the fighters or their Operators, not the Phantoms or the ordinary people, not a single one of the spectators dared to ruin such an important moment for everyone on the Moon Colosseum.</p><br><br><p>With a face full of anger and rage, Nirosh rose from his seat, walking to the edge of their family's box. His hands clutched tightly at the stone slab, veins swelling on his face.</p><br><p>"Get up! Get up, you bastard!"</p><br><p>Such a harsh, disrespectful exclamation, attracted the attention of some viewers that hadn't even looked at the Marzo Family's box before.</p><br><p>"Hey! Didn't you hear me? I want you to get up and keep fighting! You've been paid money to do this! Scum!"</p><br><p>Disgust appeared on the faces of the nearby nobles, the crowd wanted him to shut up so he wouldn't disturb them or talk about things he didn't understand.</p><br><p>Though Mariel was on their side, but even for her it was too much, with a great grimace she reached out her hand, wanting to subdue Nirosh.</p><br><p>But... his anger, his desire to get Osana, his unwillingness to accept the reality that he lost, were too much to bear.</p><br><p>"You're nothing but a slum trash! You only had one goal to win being my fighter! It's already an honor that you fought for a high noble like me!"</p><br><p>Nirosh's eyes filled with blood, his teeth gritted like a mad demon's, dropping the mask from his face that he was trying to keep for the audience.</p><br><p>"If you don't do this now, I swear on my family's name, you will regret it, you and your filthy sisters!"</p><br><br><p>Fromund's fingertips trembled, a light, faint flame headed upwards, the last shreds of his power that had come into motion as a desperate measure.</p><br><p>Struggling to keep breathing, Fromund rose to one knee before raising his head.</p><br><p>His eyes widened for a moment.</p><br><p>The first thing he saw was Adam towering full height in front of him.</p><br><p>The confusion in Fromund's gaze showed that he didn't understand how Adam ended up facing him, but neither he nor any of the viewers saw it since their attention was on Nirosh.</p><br><p>A cold wind fluttered Adam's black tips of hair as he sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"No need... you've done enough already."</p><br><p>Then, without further ado, Adam crossed his arms, pressing his forearms firmly against each other - using the last resort.</p><br><br><p>The taut strings on his gauntlets twitched at his light, gentle movements, emitting a purple sound wave.</p><br><p>Before Fromund could realize anything, the sound wave reached his ears, entering his mind like a pleasant melody.</p><br><p>His eyes slowly closed, plunging him into darkness, he was too exhausted to resist Adam's purple sound wave.</p><br><p>But, this time he didn't fall to the ground.</p><br><p>Adam caught him gently, holding him by his chest with one hand, leisurely lowering Fromund to the ground, allowing him to enjoy his well-deserved sleep.</p><br><p>Was this the end of the fight?</p><br><p>Technically yes, but something official was needed, like the judges' decision, Fromund's words of defeat accepted, or his death by Adam's hand.</p><br><p>At the Moon Colosseum, any outcome was accepted, whether it was a conventional defeat or death and... there was no time limit.</p><br><br><p>Moving away from Fromund under the staring, shocked gazes of the spectators, Adam stopped in the very center of the arena.</p><br><p>He glanced at the crowd, in the eyes of some he saw anxiety and worry, some longed for a bloodthirsty and violent finale, and some just wanted to know what Adam would do next.</p><br><p>If he killed Fromund now, no one would punish him for it, because it was part of the rules of the battle on the Moon Colosseum, and each of the fighters was ready for it.</p><br><br><p>Warm tears flowed from Arayna's eyes, traveling down her cheeks and falling down, crashing to the ground.</p><br><p>Silvana turned to her left, looking at Elva, Liv, and Tilda who were trying to hold back their emotions, but hardly anyone in their place would have enough strength for that, soon they gave up, letting out their cries.</p><br><p>Erik patted Tilda's shoulder encouragingly, understanding what she was feeling right now.</p><br><p>"Well... Here we've reached the end. That was..." Erik wanted to say his opinion on the fight but decided to keep silent.</p><br><p>Deep inside Silvana was glad that Adam won, but she didn't dare to smile and show it, instead, he stepped towards Arayna, standing in front of her.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Arayna was confused.</p><br><p>Then, Silvana hugged her tightly, letting her tears spill out onto her shoulder.</p><br><br><p>At that very moment, under a powerful gust of wind rushing through the colosseum's sharp peaks, Adam slowly raised his sword.</p><br><p>"You..." Adam wheezed in a low voice.</p><br><p>The crimson sword's tip pointed at one particular person - Nirosh.</p><br><p>"You're on the same level as me, right?"</p><br><p>Enjoy more content from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>His gaze grew deeper like the lower reaches of an abyss.</p><br><p>"In that case, come out. I challenge you to a deadly battle Nirosh Marzo, I use The Rule Oo Power!"</p>
