            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1099: Black Tower (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>At the very top of the black tower, which was usually reserved for only one person, the leader of the Black Swan, there were now three people.</p><br><p>The wide balcony offered a view not only of the entire Lower Ring but also of the other three towers, which seemed slightly lower, as the black tower was located in the north.</p><br><p>Although they were underground, there was more than enough space for the cold winds to ruffle their hair and make the coffee in three unusually large cups tremble.</p><br><p>If there was anything in this world that Wilfred loved as much as cigarettes, it was coffee and sweets, as harmful as possible.</p><br><p>Well, that man basically loved everything forbidden. It was deep in his nature.</p><br><p>“Alright, where shall we start, kids?” Wilfred said dryly, taking a sip of coffee. “I advise you to choose something simple to start with. If I brought you here and made coffee, it means I’ve set aside enough time for you. We’re in no hurry, at least I’m not, and that’s the most important thing.”</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana looked at each other. Adam was the first to speak.</p><br><p>“The Black Threat Level, I understand that they are divided into five ranks, but what about the Frozen Krugo? The beast I fought. You said it was a Dormant Phase monster. What does that mean?”</p><br><p>Wilfred exhaled. “It’s simple. Before you got to the Dark Shore, you encountered two Hollow Wave monsters. Even earlier, you defeated the Crimson Monarch.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded in confirmation. Wilfred was talking about Arnoth and Kreyna, even though Adam had only fought one of them.</p><br><p>“You see, unlike the Frozen Krugo, they are not the Dormant Phase monsters. The reason is not that they are the Hollow Wave monsters and the others are the New Wave monsters, although often this is quite closely related.”</p><br><p>Brushing off the ashes, Wilfred pointed at Adam. “Those serpents you worked with to defeat that powerful Hollow Wave monster, what do they have in common with your enemy?”</p><br><p>Adam thought for a moment.</p><br><p>He knew for sure that Arnoth was a Hollow Wave monster, while Heret, Vorx, and the others were New Wave monsters.</p><br><p>But… what did they share?</p><br><p>Then, Adam’s eyes widened in realization.</p><br><p>“They can speak, right? I mean, the Frozen Krugo is much stronger than any serpent from the Fallen Ring Castle, but he can only growl, no coherent speech.”</p><br><br><p>Wilfred snapped his fingers.</p><br><p>“Bingo! What’s more, although the Frozen Krugo isn’t as stupid as monsters of weaker Threat Levels, it’s impossible to call it intelligent, but monsters with consciousness are a different story altogether.”</p><br><p>“So…” Adam lingered. “If they’re not the Dormant Phase monsters, then who are they? And, is the only difference between serpents and monsters like the Frozen Krugo the presence of consciousness in the former?”</p><br><p>Wilfred shook his head.</p><br><p>“It’s not just about consciousness, although it greatly affects a monster’s combat abilities, which is obvious. Such monsters are called the Awakened Phase monsters.</p><br><p>“This awakening can happen to any monster, allowing it not only to understand speech and gain consciousness but also to control its energy much better or even create special abilities that are rare for ordinary monsters.”</p><br><br><p>“I see. Does that mean Kenward and Saegar are also Awakened Phase monsters?”</p><br><p>“Technically, yes, but they went through this stage a long time ago, as you understand. The majority of the Awakened Monsters are among the Hollow Wave monsters, and they are located at the Dark Shore. Although, as you have discovered from your own experience, there are also Awakened Ones among the New Wave monsters, and vice versa.”</p><br><br><p>There was silence for a moment.</p><br><p>Now, Adam and Silvana were thinking about what to ask next.</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip. “Mr. Wilfred, when Adam first met Kenward, he didn’t kill Adam only because of the dark route. That’s… He said that the First Star brought Adam to the Dark Shore. Could it be that the First Star and the Last Star exist?”</p><br><p>That was a big one. At least it was for Adam and Silvana, but Wilfred knew all about it, as did anyone of his level.</p><br><p>“Sure. In fact, as an Operator, you should know that the government makes almost no secret of this information.”</p><br><p>Silvana gulped. “Not exactly… As an Operator, I always had access to information about the Midnight Crystal. But all I knew was that there was a theory that the Midnight Crystal might be a fragment of the Last Star. I only learned about the First Star and the Midnight Crystals because Adam ended up at the Dark Shore.”</p><br><p>Wilfred brushed off the ashes before turning his gaze to Silvana.</p><br><p>“Well, anyway, it’s true. The First Star and the Last Star exist, and the Midnight and Twilight Crystals are actually parts of them. However, if you want to see them, I’m afraid you won’t be able to. Although…”</p><br><p>Suddenly, the atmosphere became gloomy, as if Wilfred was about to tell them about their impending death sentence.</p><br><p>Adam became alert, and Silvana forgot how to breathe from the tension.</p><br><p>Instead of continuing the conversation, Wilfred looked away at the lights among the city streets and the thousands of people rushing about their business. The same thing was happening at the Upper Ring. The entire Citadel was in motion every day thanks to the lives of tens of millions of people.</p><br><p>“Perhaps, soon you will have that opportunity, if you don’t die before it happens, of course.”</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>“Wilfred, what are you talking about? The First Star and the Last Star exist, but… are you saying that there is an event where they will reveal themselves and everyone will be able to see them?”</p><br><p>Wilfred smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>Unlike Adam and Silvana, who were about to learn the dark secret of their world, he found himself in this situation many times, constantly answering the same question.</p><br><br><p>Wilfred said firmly as his deep green eyes stared at Adam.</p><br><p>“Have you ever wondered why some monsters are the Hollow Wave monsters and others are the New Wave ones?”</p><br><p>There was no answer.</p><br><p>Finally, Wilfred took a drag on his cigarette.</p><br><p>“It’s very simple, Adam… Soon, the Last Star will arrive in our world and destroy it. Once again.”</p>
