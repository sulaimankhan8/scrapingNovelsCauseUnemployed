            <br><p>Olax, like any experienced fighter, had his tactics for fighting against both monsters and Phantoms. Many people didn't realize it, but unlike Upper Ring Phantoms, Lower Ring Phantoms usually had quite a bit of experience fighting against other Phantoms.</p><br><p>This was logical, it was quite rare for truly bloody and deadly battles between Phantoms to occur in the Upper Ring.</p><br><p>The Big Three, the military, and the government did their best to make it happen as rarely as possible because the main enemies of the Phantoms were monsters, not humans.</p><br><p>However, this had its negative effects, there were fewer Phantoms in the Lower Ring, but on average, each of them was much stronger, especially in a battle against humans.</p><br><p>Thus, Olax's confidence in victory was more than reasonable, especially against an archer, but... Upper Ring was not a paradise. Many Phantoms in the Upper Ring had to go through just as hard a life as the dark Phantoms, and it seemed Fred was one of them.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Rays of light rose upward like pillars of heaven, tearing apart everything in their path, be it air currents, dust, or darkness.</p><br><p>Naturally, Olax and his dark clones were no exception.</p><br><p>'What the fuck...? And... Why is it so beautiful?' Olax inwardly muttered, looking at the rays of light surrounding him from all sides.</p><br><p>It seemed that something was hiding within them, Fred's fears and his hopes, for which he had to go through a lot. It was impossible to realize more in a moment, for soon Olax fell to the ground.</p><br><p>Fred's Second Order came to an end, the misty cross dissipated, and Fred fell to one knee. A stream of blood rushed from his mouth, this ability had cost him far more than it might have seemed.</p><br><p>"Is that all...?" Olax muttered, looking up at the gray sky, while blood flowed endlessly from the corners of his mouth.</p><br><p>Fred turned around, glaring at his defeated foe.</p><br><p>Olax was missing his right leg and left arm, and there were three wide through holes in his torso, his organs were destroyed, and the bleeding was irreversible.</p><br><p>"Yeah, it looks like it. This is your failure, isn't it?" Fred said calmly, rising to his feet. However, no sooner had he taken one step than his face twisted in pain, and he fell to one knee again, holding his chest with his hand.</p><br><p>"Hehehehe... Looks like you won't be able to continue the fight either... However, you won, and I lost, there's no changing that..." Olax whispered as everything in front of his eyes slowly went dark, "Better to die at the hands of a decent man than at the clutches of a savage monster..."</p><br><p>Those were his last words, after which he closed his eyes, forever.</p><br><p>Fred smiled bitterly, shaking his head.</p><br><p>'Fred, you've won! You... You did good!' Mika said encouragingly.</p><br><p>"Well... I was on the verge..." Fred sighed, leaning back against the nearly destroyed stone wall.</p><br><p>Then, his gaze shifted to Olax.</p><br><p>"If he could somehow survive that attack, it would be the end for me, I could do nothing against him..." Fred's gaze darkened, "Whatever, my fight wasn't the most important."</p><br><br><p>It was true, out of the three active fights, two were already over.</p><br><p>Prago had won and was rushing to the rescue, while Fred was recovering from a hard fight. However, they needed time to come back since their battles weren't easy, but what about Ester and Romeo?</p><br><p>Their job was to buy time for Adam so he could regain his strength and join them. Adam wasn't going to run away, moreover, there was nowhere to run to. There were dozens of Phantoms, hundreds of monsters, and powerful anomalies.</p><br><p>Sure, Tirana was a strong opponent, but against her was Ester with a similar element, and Romeo, who, with his ice, could give Tirana a lot of trouble.</p><br><p>The fight could last a really long time, and it was unclear who was going to win, in any case, the winner would be severely exhausted and injured.</p><br><p>Well, it was all just theory... which didn't always work, and it was not uncommon for things to turn out differently in practice.</p><br><br><p>Tirana stepped confidently, walking beside Ester and Romeo lying on the ground. Their bodies were covered in burns, but Tirana was almost unharmed.</p><br><p>A few scratches and faintly bleeding cuts were all her wounds.</p><br><p>"Wait..." Ester wheezed, trying to grab Tirana's leg.</p><br><br><p>Tirana, with contempt on her face, kicked Ester in the stomach, tossing her aside like a bag of trash not worth her attention.</p><br><p>Romeo struggled to stay conscious, seeing only Tirana's blurred silhouette in front of him. He didn't have the strength to even get up, Tirana had driven him to his death state.</p><br><p>A random stream of wind blew through, fluttering Tirana's crimson hair while she looked around.</p><br><p>The Dark Phantoms were not far away from her, rarely fighting monsters and other Phantoms, after all their main goal was to capture Adam, not kill everyone in their path.</p><br><p>The anomalies grew thicker and thicker, while the monsters increased in number. It would take a lot of time to clear such a large cluster as well as the Phantoms, several strong squads.</p><br><p>Tirana nodded slightly, realizing the situation she was in. They needed to capture Adam and get out of there before the chaos became all-consuming.</p><br><p>"Can you stop hiding? Your comrades have already done enough!" Tirana exclaimed, pointing her sword at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam became wary, glancing at his right hand. He could summon a needle and use a single Nexus Trait, but that was his maximum. Obviously, it was not enough to pass Tirana.</p><br><p>'Shit. What am I supposed to do? Even if I run away from Tirana, the Dark Phantoms will catch me! Maybe take advantage of the monsters? Tsk. That's unlikely.</p><br><p>Considering their numbers and Tirana's strength, no monsters will be a threat to them.' Adam pondered while Tirana gradually approached him.</p><br><p>Then, Tirana looked to the side and pointed at Adam:</p><br><p>"Grab him." Tirana majestically uttered, and several dark Phantoms instantly rushed forward, eager to fulfill her order.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide when a second later he had to summon a needle and block several flaming projectiles.</p><br><p>It looked like he was completely surrounded, there were too many dark Phantoms, and no one could help him. Prago was too far away, and Fred wasn't even able to stand on his feet confidently.</p><br><p>"Kid! Look out!" The man exclaimed, charging into the fight with his comrades. Their squad consisted of ten Phantoms, and they were among those who had originally gone to Adam's aid.</p><br><p>"We'll help you!" The woman in snow-white armor exclaimed before bringing her massive shield down to the ground and creating a golden protective dome around Adam and their squad.</p><br><p>Then, the Phantom of their squad rushed into battle, supporting their leader and allowing Adam to rest in relief. Sure, it wasn't enough, but first aid was the most important, other squads would be coming soon, and for the dark Phantoms that was a big problem.</p><br><p>Tirana frowned as she rushed into battle, realizing that time was getting short.</p><br><p>'Great! This way, we can win!' Adam said internally as a happy smile formed on his face.</p><br><p>Adam watched as the Phantoms fought, and it was obvious that they were experienced fighters. However, Adam was not going to stand idly by, he was now ready to fight!</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, and soon... the smile disappeared from his face.</p><br><p>White electrical discharges ran through the bodies of the Phantoms in front of him, which was a harbinger of a devastating lightning strike that swept through the Phantoms and wiped them off the face of the earth, turning more than ten Phantoms from different Rings into nothing, leaving only a black trail of glowing embers on the ground.</p>
