            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1235: View from the Other Side (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>There was one thing that Adam, Fromund, Katrin, Alexia, and other Phantoms like them never thought about.</p><br><br><p>For them, it was something natural. They didn’t want to survive and become strong enough not to fear weaker monsters.</p><br><p>No, they were hungry for victory and triumph. They wanted to see what the Dead Lands had to offer, what rewards lay behind the most difficult challenges. And as they learned more about the world, about the secrets that the government had carefully hidden, their goals changed and became only higher and grander.</p><br><p>Sure, everyone had their weak moments along the way, and Adam was no exception, because if it weren’t for Fromund, he might have taken a step back and given up on his selfish idea of stopping the World Wipe.</p><br><p>It was greedy, incredibly greedy, and that was exactly why he wanted to do it. He wanted to get everything at once, like a hungry monster who couldn’t quench his thirst with blood, energy, or strength.</p><br><br><p>Not all Phantoms were like them.</p><br><p>The young man with the axe and the girl were clear examples of this. They had become Phantoms not long ago, as they were newbies and still at the K0 Level.</p><br><p>It was the first and easiest level. Most Phantoms moved on to the K1 Level, but the Dead Lands were a dangerous place, and newbies often died at the very beginning of their journey.</p><br><p>Most people wanted simple, trivial things: safety, freedom, family, and so on.</p><br><p>All of this could be provided by money and the initial level of strength that would allow them to fight monsters and defend themselves if necessary.</p><br><br><p>Even a K1 Phantom could provide a good life for itself and simply go on low-risk missions every few weeks. Many did so, and for newbies, it became a goal.</p><br><p>They couldn’t be called cowards. No, they were acting quite sensibly. Every Phantom, even a newbie, understood that even reaching the K2 level was a thorny path full of obstacles and deadly risks.</p><br><p>Naturally, the K3 and K4 levels were a challenge of higher difficulty.</p><br><p>All they wanted was to reach a level where they could secure a peaceful and long life without worrying about anything.</p><br><p>This was the best and safest option for a newcomer.</p><br><p>Everything would have been fine if it weren’t for one thing…</p><br><p>The World Wipe existed.</p><br><p>Thus, the Phantoms who stopped at the K2 level or dreamed of reaching that stage and enjoying life were doomed, as were their families.</p><br><p>Ironically, they didn’t know this, because if the government had made information about the World Wipe public, it would have led to widespread panic and millions of deaths.</p><br><p>Only those greedy for power and ambition had a chance to become strong enough to survive the World Wipe under Queen Elisa’s barrier. However, the mortality rate among such Phantoms was monstrous compared to those who chose the safe path.</p><br><p>In the end, the choice remained between a peaceful life with a sudden end from the World Wipe or a path full of battles and pain to reach the top.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s voice rang out, cold and harsh.</p><br><p>He understood that the girl and the young man didn’t know about the World Wipe, but he couldn’t understand why their desires were so simple.</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could say anything forbidden, the golden-haired guy stepped forward.</p><br><p>“The K4 Level!” He exclaimed, striking his chest.</p><br><p>“Agh?” Adam raised an eyebrow, puzzled.</p><br><p>“That’s my minimum! First, I’ll become as strong as you, and then I’ll surpass you!”</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam’s expression changed from cold to warm.</p><br><p>With a smirk, he lifted his chin, looking at the golden-haired guy.</p><br><p>“Oh, not bad goals, but how much time do you plan to spend on this? You know, it’s better to get strong faster. Otherwise, you’ll face a strong monster you won’t stand a chance against.”</p><br><p>Obviously, that wasn’t the main reason, but Adam couldn’t tell them about the World Wipe, or else the three of them would be in big trouble.</p><br><p>“A few years, ten at most!” he exclaimed with a serious gaze.</p><br><p>Adam nodded. “I see. You want to be ten times slower than me? Hah, it’s your business.”</p><br><p>“No! That’s not what I said!”</p><br><br><p>Fromund’s hand fell on Adam’s shoulder.</p><br><p>“Hey, I think that’s enough. It’s time for them to go home, just like us.”</p><br><p>At that moment, the sound of engines roared as two fighter jets flew toward the fortress, slowly approaching the ground.</p><br><p>The blue lights from the engines faded as the ramps descended to the surface.</p><br><p>Immediately, several groups of soldiers ran outside, surveying the area and preparing for evacuation.</p><br><p>They knew that there was no longer any threat from the monsters, otherwise, they would have fired missiles at the skeletons to give the Phantoms a chance to escape.</p><br><br><p>A tall woman in a black outfit stepped forward. Her long blond hair fell below her shoulders as she walked straight toward Adam, who was standing in the middle of the fortress.</p><br><p>“Mr. Adam, Mr. Fromund, I have been informed that you helped these Phantoms survive. As an officer, I thank you on behalf of the entire Bastion Opard. Every Phantom is crucial to us!” the woman said in a passionate voice.</p><br><p>In response, Adam nodded slightly.</p><br><p>He hadn’t encountered ordinary military personnel who weren’t part of the Gamma Division in a long time. He was pleased to see such dedication.</p><br><p>“Yeah, a series of events led to this. I think you already know everything.”</p><br><p>The woman nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“I understand they completed their mission?” Adam pointed to the youths.</p><br><p>“Yes. The K1-Phantoms and Harvesters will arrive soon to gather resources. It’s too dangerous for them to stay here. They need rest after what happened. But…” The woman bit her lip. “What about you?”</p><br><p>Then, Adam looked at the empty land in the distance. Several squads were fighting weak monsters, performing the simplest missions, just what was needed for newbies.</p><br><p>Nothing was interesting for Adam on this path, despite his desire to reach the walls on foot sooner.</p><br><p>He turned to Fromund. “What do you say? Let’s fly home?”</p><br>
