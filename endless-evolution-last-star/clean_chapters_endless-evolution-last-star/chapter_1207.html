            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1207: Wrong Ability (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Fromund preferred to fight against large groups of enemies. The Kirani Bugs were an excellent option, but they were too weak for him to prove himself and feel the satisfaction of victory.</p><br><p>Well, Marhen and a dozen of the thunder monsters were clearly a much more serious threat than the hundreds and even thousands of insects that no longer flew among the caves. The Kirani Bugs remained on the walls or hid deep in the caves, as they understood that their work was done.</p><br><p>The Kirani Queen called them to help—dealing with Fromund was their job.</p><br><p>For this reason, Fromund did not kill the two monsters from the start.</p><br><p>He wanted to understand what they were capable of and then use one of his strongest attacks to find out how many of them could survive.</p><br><p>That way, he could reduce their numbers to five or six of the strongest, mainly hoping that Marhen would be able to give him a decent fight.</p><br><p>What was this ability that Fromund used?</p><br><p>Well, unfortunately or not, Marhen and the others wouldn’t get to see it because Fromund forgot that he was deep underground.</p><br><p>This ability simply couldn’t appear here.</p><br><br><p>Clash. Clash. Clash.</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam was trying to cope with Bathild’s pressure. After being struck by a thunderbolt, filling her body with power, she became significantly faster and more dangerous.</p><br><p>After missing the first attack, Adam barely managed to recover in time to block Bathild’s next attack.</p><br><p>Besides her, the intensifying storm also posed a danger.</p><br><p>Every few seconds, thunder strikes rained down on the ground. None of them had hit Adam yet, but the threat was there.</p><br><p>What’s more, he had no way to dodge them, as Bathild didn’t give him even a second to come up with a plan.</p><br><p>‘Shit! How did she get so strong?!’ Adam exclaimed inwardly before blocking Bathild’s claws.</p><br><p>Electric discharges flashed before his eyes as Bathild’s frame shook.</p><br><p>She spun around as her leg slammed into Adam’s side, throwing him into the nearest purple plant.</p><br><br><p>The plant broke against Adam’s back, as did the dark rock in the distance.</p><br><p>Adam glanced down—directly below him was a lava lake, hot enough to burn him.</p><br><p>The worst part was that it wasn’t a coincidence, but Bathild’s plan.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Lightning ran through her body as a lightning orb condensed between her hands.</p><br><p>She clenched it as a bright flash appeared high above Adam, among the clouds—the thunder strike was approaching him.</p><br><p>Once the lightning struck him and he was deep beneath the lake, it would be a little harder to defeat him. Bathild would not stop. She would continue to attack until Adam could no longer fight.</p><br><p>However… Bathild did not realize that Adam’s position in the air was not a big problem for him.</p><br><br><p>Bathild blinked when a second needle appeared in Adam’s hand. With the next swing, the lesser path cut the thunderbolt in two as Adam found himself several meters above the lake, higher than he had been a moment ago.</p><br><p>Then, he turned and threw one rod straight at Bathild.</p><br><p>It was slow, and she took a step to the side as the rod dug into the ground next to her.</p><br><p>“Hmm? What was that? I should have realized he could destroy the thunderbolt, but did he think he could hit me with such a clumsy throw?”</p><br><p>She soon got her answer.</p><br><br><p>A line of flame ran along the dark thread as Adam appeared next to Bathild, pulling his rod out of the ground.</p><br><p>“Hello, now it’s my turn, isn’t it?” Adam said as his foot was already moving toward her like a heavy hammer.</p><br><p>“FUCK!” Bathild crossed her arms in front of her, blocking his attack.</p><br><p>Adam was about to continue, but Silvana’s sudden voice made him stop.</p><br><p>He didn’t know what was going on, as his eyes widened.</p><br><p>“WHAT? What did he do? Fromund… He’s an idiot!” Adam shouted, looking up at the sky.</p><br><p>Bathild was as puzzled as he was angry.</p><br><p>Soon she realized what was going on.</p><br><p>Amidst the dark clouds filled with lightning, several red dots appeared.</p><br><p>Then, dozens of meteors tore through the sky, leaving wide gaps and fiery trails behind them.</p><br><p>Was this Fromund’s original plan? Of course not.</p><br><p>He didn’t want to interfere in Adam’s fight because he knew that he had to deal with Bathild himself.</p><br><p>Fromund summoned the meteors to rain down on Marhen and the thunder monsters. But he didn’t think that the meteors would need quite so much space to appear.</p><br><p>After all, his ability only worked when the meteors fell from a great height, from the sky to the ground.</p><br><p>Thus, instead of the meteors becoming a problem for Marhen, they were now a direct threat to Adam and Bathild.</p><br><p>Moreover, the meteors severely damaged the storm, leaving no more than half of it. Behind them, only the night sky dotted with a myriad of stars was visible.</p><br><p>Bathild’s eyes flashed as the corners of her lips turned upward.</p><br><p>She saw an opportunity.</p><br><p>“I don’t know what’s going on here, but judging by your reaction, your friend did this. Hah, he’ll be to blame for your death!”</p><br><p>Bathild rushed forward, grabbing Adam firmly by the wrist.</p><br><p>Before he could react, Bathild spun around and threw him as high as she could. Considering that she was an Elder, her physical strength would have allowed her to throw Adam straight into the clouds.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened as he saw the first meteor in front of him.</p><br><p>He had to switch the second needle to the first one, cutting the meteor in two. Then, he crashed into the one behind it.</p><br><p>This meteor fall was much larger than the one Fromund used against the volcano beasts.</p><br><p>This time, there were several dozen meteors, each powerful enough to injure a Black Threat Monster or a Phantom of the same level.</p><br><p>Bathild licked her fangs and jumped, creating several energy blasts behind her to accelerate.</p><br><p>She leaped away from the debris of the first meteor, quickly approaching Adam.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Fromund scratched the back of his head as he looked up.</p><br><p>‘Damn, I hope that doesn’t interfere with his fight.’</p><br><p>Then, he looked at Marhen and smiled broadly.</p><br><p>“Alright. I won’t make that mistake again. Let’s fight!”</p>
