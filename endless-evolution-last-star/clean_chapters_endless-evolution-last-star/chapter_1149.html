            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1149: Two Chosen Ones (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Douglas, watching the fight, frowned. It was clear that he was not happy with Adam’s decision to let Lyrod become stronger.</p><br><p>“What? What is he doing? His desire to fight against the strongest and constantly be on the brink of destruction will surely ruin him one day! Right after the cut, he should have used his needles and torn that monster to pieces!”</p><br><p>However, Damien did not share Douglas’s position.</p><br><p>“Hah, old man, how many years has it been since you last fought seriously? It seems you’ve completely forgotten how to do it, haven’t you?”</p><br><p>“Agh? Are you suggesting I go out to the Dead Lands and kill monsters one after another under the shocked gaze of young Phantoms?”</p><br><p>Damien chuckled darkly.</p><br><p>“Come on, that’s not what I’m talking about. Adam did the right thing, at least I would have done the same in his place. He knows that Lyrod has a trump card, the energy from the dark dream. Sure, maybe he could have killed him during the cut, and Lyrod wouldn’t have had time to use that power, but neither you, nor I, nor he can be sure of that.”</p><br><p>Douglas frowned as he scratched his beard.</p><br><p>“I see, he decided not to take any chances and let Lyrod reach the border to avoid such a situation. So that their next clash would be the final one. But… Something’s not right here.”</p><br><p>Shaking his head, Douglas touched his temples.</p><br><p>“It all sounds like a well-thought-out plan of action, with risk assessment. That’s not like Adam. That’s not how he fights.”</p><br><br><p>Damien’s hand fell on Douglas’s shoulder, squeezing it tightly.</p><br><br><p>A broad grin spread across Damien’s face as he watched the events unfold.</p><br><p>“You see a safe plan of action, but Adam sees an opportunity to use his power in a risky way. Which is what he always does!”</p><br><p>“Hah, you really like this guy, don’t you?”</p><br><p>“Well, are you saying you don’t feel the same way?”</p><br><p>In response, Douglas merely shrugged. He neither confirmed nor denied it.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Lyrod straightened up as he stretched his neck. A crack echoed across the empty land as he slowly opened his eyes.</p><br><p>Now, his turquoise eyes, due to their new depth, began to resemble Adam’s blue ones.</p><br><p>“You got what you wanted, right?” Lyrod asked while streams of energy surrounded him. “For what? You had the opportunity to finish me off earlier.”</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly as he shook his head.</p><br><p>“I don’t think so. Only now, you don’t have a single trump card left, unlike me.” Adam grinned to reveal the red sword seal on his hand.</p><br><br><p>“Indeed. Your black sword is still healing you. I don’t know what that seal on your hand is capable of, but… I’m afraid it doesn’t matter because now I’m one level stronger than you. Because of your mistake, we’re on different stages, and you’re on the weak end.”</p><br><p>Then, Lyrod shrugged.</p><br><p>“Let me show you. Unfortunately, words can’t convey some things accurately.”</p><br><p>With an unusual carefree look in his eyes, Lyrod pulled his hand back, gripping his spear tightly.</p><br><p>The next thing Adam saw was a bright flash rushing straight at him. All his instincts kicked in, causing his body to jump to the side.</p><br><p>In the next moment, the flash covered the dark land as a short tremor ran across the surface.</p><br><p>A pillar of acid rose from the lake, hidden behind the lake, high enough for every inhabitant of the Corrosive Lakes to see it.</p><br><p>The shockwave from the explosion was accompanied by wild gusts of wind running from the epicenter.</p><br><br><p>Lyrod snapped his fingers as a new spear woven from the energy surrounding him appeared in his hand.</p><br><p>“I hope I don’t need to explain that I missed on purpose. Obviously, you could have dodged, since I threw the spear too slowly, but… That won’t happen again.”</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Lyrod’s muscles tensed as all his energy flowed to the tattoos on his arm. He did everything he could to make his next throw so fast that Adam would have no chance to dodge.</p><br><br><p>In response, Adam stepped forward as the sword seal glowed brightly.</p><br><p>The black sword hovering above him shattered into fragments. He had activated the sword seal so that the abilities of his artifact had come to an end.</p><br><p>Lyrod frowned, trying to figure out what Adam had done. What was the effect of the sword seal?</p><br><p>In fact, there were several options, and Adam had chosen the one he needed most at that moment.</p><br><p>Red energy covered his body as the smallest cuts disappeared from his body. For a short period, his regeneration rose to an incredible level until the energy of the sword seal was depleted.</p><br><p>“You think you can survive my attack with regeneration? That’s ridiculous!” Lyrod exclaimed as his spear glowed brightly, ready to strike.</p><br><p>In response, Adam shook his head as he took a deep breath.</p><br><p>“Nah, I don’t need this regeneration to defend myself from you, but from myself.”</p><br><p>Confusion flashed across Lyrod’s face, but he soon got the answer to his question.</p><br><p>Neither rods, needles, nor Silvana appeared next to Adam. Instead, five rings connected by chains covered his right arm.</p><br><p>Lyrod had seen what Adam’s Nexus was capable of, but he knew it wouldn’t be enough to defeat him at his current strength.</p><br><br><p>Soon Lyrod’s face turned pale.</p><br><p>Bright runes lit up on the first ring as they should, but soon the runes lit up on the second ring as well, putting Adam under tremendous pressure that he was unable to withstand at his level.</p><br><p>That was why he needed regeneration.</p><br><p>“That won’t help you! You’re going to die anyway!” Lyrod exclaimed in panic, throwing his spears directly at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam’s frame shook as he lunged forward with a crimson burst, quickly closing the distance.</p><br><p>The spear should have killed him, but it shattered into fibers upon colliding with Adam’s open palm, unable to overcome the energy of his Nexus.</p><br><p>Lyrod’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br><br><p>Then, he looked down only to see that Adam’s palm was on his chest.</p><br><p>Red light covered Lyrod’s face like his dying wish.</p><br><p>Under Adam’s deep gaze, a crimson blast erupted, destroying everything in sight.</p>
