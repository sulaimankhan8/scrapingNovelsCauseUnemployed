            <br><p>'What the hell...?' Adam inwardly uttered, looking at Fromund's calm, confident posture.</p><br><p>He as well as hundreds of spectators watched Fromund nonchalantly raise his foot hoping with a simple stomp to stop the powerful shaking coming at him like an earthquake.</p><br><p>However, unlike Adam who had already used the full power of his Elemental Root, two gravitational strikes were all he had, otherwise, he couldn't even raise his arms, Fromund still hadn't revealed the essence of his one.</p><br><p>"Well, let's see how strong your Nexus quake is, judging by the looks of it it's only a side function, unlike my Elemental Root!" Fromund exclaimed before slamming his right foot onto the ground.</p><br><p>Amber waves of energy went down in a single stream, having full power over this element.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, wide cracks spread across the ground with far greater speed and force than from Adam's vibrations.</p><br><p>But... it wasn't the tremble that was Fromund's Elemental Root ability, it was merely a preparation for something more.</p><br><p>Stone peaks showed from beneath, bursting the ground like an unstoppable force of nature.</p><br><p>Adam's vibrations were gone, lost among the cracks and peaks rushing towards him.</p><br><br><p>Taking a step back, Adam raised his hands intending to destroy the peaks with his threads, but... as soon as his fingers tensed he abandoned the idea.</p><br><p>Read latest stories on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>'No... Two threads won't be enough to pull this off. I'll be able to destroy the first stone peaks, but that's just the beginning...'</p><br><p>For a moment Adam considered using all his threads again, but the mere thought of it echoed with pain in his heart. It was a pressure he could not afford.</p><br><p>A slight panic rose in Adam's eyes, he realized what would happen to him if he didn't destroy the stone peaks, then his gaze fell on his gauntlets.</p><br><p>'Right... They're not very durable, after all, it's just stone infused with energy. It will be enough for me to destroy the sharp tips and... I can do it in one move!'</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam smashed the gauntlets against each other, roughly and aggressively causing the taut strings to quiver and release the first sonic wave.</p><br><p>The red wave moved away from Adam, in a heartbeat passing through all the stone peaks as well as Fromund, who due to the speed of the sound didn't have time to dodge or realize anything.</p><br><p>"What... Threads, lightning, vibrations, and now sound too? Fuck... don't you have too many abilities...? Asshole..."</p><br><br><p>Two streams of blood ripped in a powerful stream from Fromund's ears, rendering him deaf for a few seconds.</p><br><p>He didn't hear the spectators' shouts, didn't pay attention to their reactions - he just watched as the stone peaks, one by one, collapsed into stone rubble.</p><br><p>A palpable pain echoed in his leg, reminding him that this was his only use of the Elemental Root.</p><br><p>But... Fromund had no regrets.</p><br><p>'Yeah... I should have guessed that he would find a way to destroy the stone peaks and that's a good thing. As far as I'm concerned he has nothing left and his threads aren't as dangerous as they used to be.'</p><br><p>Exhaustion was reflected in Fromund's gaze and his pale face, but he still had the strength to fight, his body could take much more.</p><br><br><p>Two sturdy gauntlets moved away from each other with a cascade of sparks. Taking two tentative steps back, Adam regained his balance looking at the aftermath of the red sound wave.</p><br><p>Everything between him and Fromund was covered in rocks, small stones turned to dust, slowly falling into cracks.</p><br><p>'Damn, Adam, you can't stop. We need to attack right now!'</p><br><p>With those thoughts, Adam raised his hands to bring the threads down on Fromund, but... before he could take the first swing the threads shuddered, exploding in energy.</p><br><p>White particles flashed before his deep eyes, he no longer had the power to keep his Initial Order active, one of his limits had been reached.</p><br><p>Fearing that Fromund would take advantage of his weakness, Adam immediately summoned the needle - this was reflected by a trickle of blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><br><p>However, his fears were not confirmed. His opponent stood still, trying to clean the blood from his ears, it was not very convenient to do it with one hand.</p><br><p>"Adam, I'm afraid you've wasted a lot more than I have. I probably shouldn't say this to your opponent, but I'm sorry you've pretty much lost already."</p><br><p>In response, Adam frowned heavily, holding his needle tightly with both hands.</p><br><p>"What are you talking about? I lost an eye, while you lost your main arm! You can't even fight freely with your overly heavy sword!"</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam was right, one arm wasn't so strong to swing such a large sword for a long time.</p><br><br><p>Without saying anything, Fromund walked over to his sword, a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>He gently unclenched the fingers of his severed hand to free the hilt of the sword before confidently raising his weapon, holding the blade down.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, it seemed he finally realized what Fromund was about to do.</p><br><p>"Yeah, that's exactly what it is."</p><br><br><p>The flames engulfed the sword, it wasn't just ignition by heat, but complete melting to turn the sword into nothing more than liquid metal.</p><br><p>And... Fromund had done it once before.</p><br><p>Silvana slowly turned to Arayna with eyes full of disbelief.</p><br><p>"What the hell...? His Nexus has three fucking shapes?"</p><br><p>Arayna smiled slyly, not hiding her joy for Fromund.</p><br><p>"Yes, is there a problem? And, just so you know, Fromund is best handled with something other than a hammer or sword since his primary weapon is-"</p><br><br><p>Fromund waved his hand, revealing his new and, this time final weapon.</p><br><p>The long black hilt, thick and rigid, was twisted into a swirling tip of red-hot metal, the infernal embers burning between the blades, releasing black jets of smoke.</p><br><p>The massive spear was intended not just to pierce his enemy, but to destroy his flesh and bones, to burn him to the ground and overwhelm him with its power and speed.</p><br><p>Yet... something in Fromund's gaze made Adam anxious as if the spear was the second to the end and his opponent was hiding his last trump card.</p>
