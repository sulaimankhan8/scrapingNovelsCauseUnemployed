            <br><br><p>One blow after another slowly rained down on Kenna.</p><br><p>With each shudder of the ground, drops of blood flew out, staining the previously shiny clean marble.</p><br><p>After Adam's fight against Giselle, no one left yet, so all the nobles at the Amber Could, were forced to watch this scene.</p><br><p>"No, this isn't right, does this look like a fight?"</p><br><p>Someone muttered in a trembling voice.</p><br><p>His buddy standing nearby gulped.</p><br><p>"Fuck no... It's an execution, but... Is it acceptable?"</p><br><p>As if wanting to know the answer to that question, one of the nobles stepped out of his table. In a powerful stride, he headed straight toward observer no. 3, his fists clenched.</p><br><p>Despite the outraged nobleman, the blonde-haired man did not change his face.</p><br><br><p>The young man waved his hand pointing at Adam and Kenna.</p><br><p>"Why haven't you stopped this senseless, savage battle yet?! It's obvious to everyone here that you have such authority!"</p><br><p>In response, the young man received the same sly smirk.</p><br><p>"Hm? What are you talking about?"</p><br><p>"Don't mess with me!" the young man stomped on the ground in anger, "Stop the fight! You have to do it or I'll complain to the administration!"</p><br><p>With a slight smirk, the man arrogantly raised his chin.</p><br><p>"Why on earth would I do that?"</p><br><br><p>The young man's face expressed his confusion. Normally, everyone followed the rules strictly, it was their job that they performed perfectly.</p><br><p>He didn't understand why observer no. 3, one of the three special ones, ignored his legitimate request.</p><br><p>"Hah, you must be missing something," the man smiled sweetly, "I'm ready to stop the fight at any moment, but I just can't do it."</p><br><p>"What...?" the young man gulped in a disbelief, "What the hell are you talking about?!"</p><br><p>The man raised his right hand to chest level, palm open.</p><br><br><p>Then, he pointed at Adam and Kenna, to the deafening sound of another devastating blow.</p><br><p>"As you know, at the Twilight Palace, fighters can stop the duel in three different ways. As you can see, Ms. Kenna has yet to use any of them."</p><br><p>Not believing what he heard, the young man turned around abruptly. A few seconds were enough for him to realize the evilness of the situation.</p><br><p>Kenna couldn't declare that she was giving up, Adam kept her mouth shut at moments like this. She couldn't clap on the ground three times since Adam broke her arms.</p><br><p>However, for such cases, at the Twilight Palace there was another way to show their willingness to surrender - one had to blink five times while looking at the observer.</p><br><p>Why hadn't Kenna done that yet?</p><br><p>Well, she tried, but the observer just didn't see her. He purposely stood in such a position that from his angle he saw Adam's back covering Kenna.</p><br><p>Could observer no. 3, take a few steps to the side so Kenna would look at him?</p><br><br><p>But... he didn't have to do that. Remaining in one place didn't break any rules.</p><br><p>Soon, the young nobleman realized that.</p><br><p>A multitude of feelings alternately reflected on his face, anger, confusion, and ended in frustration.</p><br><p>"This isn't the right thing to do. You realize that she can't change her position! You must help her and stop the fight! Adam Vinter is doing something crazy!"</p><br><p>"Hmm?" the man raised an eyebrow, "I'm doing my job, nothing more, nothing less."</p><br><p>The young man had no more to say, he simply lowered his gaze, emptiness filling his eyes with helplessness.</p><br><br><p>For some time more, muffled thuds echoed through the massive hall, no screams - Kenna had long been on the verge of losing her senses. Only the strength of the K3-Phantom and the sturdiness of her body kept her from dying.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Silvana didn't try to stop it, though she stood nearby and was the only one who could.</p><br><p>Silvana fought the bizarre feeling growing inside her like a wild flame.</p><br><p>She genuinely enjoyed what was happening, and she didn't like it.</p><br><p>Trying to maintain a calm expression, Silvana struggled with the thoughts filling her mind.</p><br><p>'No... Silvana, this is wrong! What Adam is doing is cruel!'</p><br><p>'But...' Silvana bit her lip almost to the point of bleeding, lust filled her eyes, 'Fuck... He's doing this for me. Adam, how I love it, how I adore it when you show that I am your Operator, that I am precious to you, that I am yours!'</p><br><br><p>In complete silence, only the sound of crimson droplets crashing to the surface with Adam's bloody fist hanging over a battered Kenna could be heard.</p><br><p>Beneath the layer of wheezing, Kenna's heavy breathing came out.</p><br><p>Her face was swollen, her arms and nose broken, her internal organs must have been severely damaged and lacerations covered her entire body.</p><br><p>Only Phantom's physique allowed her to stay alive in such a situation.</p><br><br><p>Adam stood up, looked at Silvana, and stepped towards her.</p><br><p>Without saying anything, they nodded to each other and headed forward, intending to leave the Amber Cloud along the same path.</p><br><p>Suddenly, a careless voice sounded behind them.</p><br><p>"Mr. Adam, please wait!"</p><br><p>Turning around, Adam saw observer no. 3 who was waving in the distance.</p><br><p>"Hm? What do you want?" Adam jerked his head in Kenna's direction, "Isn't that enough for you, you sly snake?"</p><br><p>In silence, the man headed straight for them. He walked beside Kenna, quickly leaned in, and stood up.</p><br><br><p>In a deft move, observer no. 3, threw a twilight coin in Adam's direction.</p><br><p>Baffled, Adam looked at the coin in his hand.</p><br><p>"What...?" he turned to the man, "What does that mean? Kenna's right, I didn't have an official fight with her, which means neither of us made a bet."</p><br><p>The man shrugged nonchalantly tucking his hands behind his back.</p><br><p>"Well, I have that right. What's more, I'm sure if it weren't for your outburst of anger, you would have offered her a fight and she wouldn't have turned it down."</p><br><p>Then, the observer looked at the barely breathing Kenna, a short, sinister laugh bursting out.</p><br><p>"Hah, obviously the outcome would be the same. Maybe not as painful, but Kenna Xeron would definitely have lost to you."</p><br><br><p>Adam snorted and quickly tore forward tentatively taking Silvana by the arm.</p><br><p>"Fuck it. Let's get out of this damn place fast."</p><br><p>The man simply waved them off.</p><br><p>'Now he only has one coin left to get.' Observer thought.</p>
