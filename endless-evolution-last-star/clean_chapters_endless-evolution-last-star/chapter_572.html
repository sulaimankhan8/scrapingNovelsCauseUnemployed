            <br><p>Zarot raised an eyebrow, he couldn't believe what he was hearing. Mariel and Nirosh's eyes were wide with shock.</p><br><p>Elva, Liv and Tilda gasped. They had heard such sums only in movies or on the news, and it wasn't always literally money.</p><br><p>They didn't know exactly what their debt was, it was one of the things Fromund never talked about, but by working together they managed to calculate how much Fromund was roughly paying per month.</p><br><p>Elva was good at math, she together with Liv and Tilda spent a lot of time to find out what levels the Phantoms had and how much they earned per month on average, given the number of missions they took on.</p><br><p>Though it was a rough and not the most accurate calculation, it was the best they had.</p><br><p>'Unbelievable...' Elva internally muttered, 'On average, every month, brother pays out 1 to 3 million, after he became a K2-Phantom, he was able to earn more. And... now he's asking for 200 million at once?'</p><br><p>Elva shuddered, and her face turned pale.</p><br><p>'How much debt do we have if that money isn't enough to pay it off? Fucking hell...'</p><br><p>Liv and Tilda had a similar reaction, they realized that 200 million credits, was a huge amount, and... they couldn't believe someone was ready to pay Fromund that much money for just one fight.</p><br><p>"Too much." Zarot waved his hand, snorting, he wouldn't even consider such a sum as an initial bid.</p><br><p>"210 million." Fromund calmly replied, as if he hadn't heard what Zarot just said.</p><br><p>Zarot frowned, clenching his fists tightly, he wanted to voice his displeasure, but someone beat him to it.</p><br><p>"Who the hell do you think you are?!" Nirosh exclaimed with a great frown, "210 million for a fight? Holy shit! You can buy several mansions in some of the best places in the First Ring for that amount of money!"</p><br><p>Fromund slowly shifted his gaze to Nirosh, his cheek resting on his hand, looking at Niorsh as someone who held no weight in these negotiations.</p><br><p>"So what of it? As I said earlier, I need money, lots of money, and you can provide me with very large sums since you are the highest nobles."</p><br><p>Nirosh's veins swelled, his face filled with anger as he clenched his fists tightly.</p><br><p>He was ready to move to action, he wasn't going to take any more humiliation towards him.</p><br><p>"Nirosh, sit back." Zarot calmly said in a heavy voice.</p><br><p>"But, father! He's extorting money from us! It's an impossible amount!" Nirosh was at a loss.</p><br><p>Zarot folded his hands together, holding them in front of him, then he exhaled a cold breath, and his aura intensified.</p><br><p>"Don't make me repeat myself. I'm doing this for you, for your wedding, and I'm negotiating with your fighter..."</p><br><p>Nirosh gulped, before slowly returning to his chair.</p><br><p>"Even though he behaved inappropriately, my son is right about something. The sums you quoted, are purposely inflated to get more favorable terms. I understand that."</p><br><p>Zarot nodded deeply, closed his eyes for a while, then stared intently at Fromund.</p><br><p>"60 million. That's my first bid." Zarot realized that it would take some time to arrive at a final total.</p><br><p>Fromund smirked slightly, the corners of his lips going up.</p><br><p>"Good, that's something to work with." Fromund shrugged, about to name his next proposal.</p><br><br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda continued to eavesdrop on their conversation, occasionally their eyes got wide when they heard sums, either from Fromund or Zarot. They did it quickly, but the negotiations were tough, each trying to get as much as they could.</p><br><p>The girls hoped Fromund could get as much money as possible.</p><br><p>Then, Elva took her ear away from the door for the first time in a long while, letting out a deep sigh. She wanted to think about the situation while she had a moment.</p><br><p>Then, she bit her lip, about to turn back to the door, but... something caught her eye.</p><br><br><p>Elva raised an eyebrow, looking out the far window at someone who decided to keep them company on this cold, eventful night.</p><br><p>On a lamppost, at the very top of which lurked a faded yellow lamp, sat a black raven, it looked directly at Elva through the corner of the window - the only trajectory from its place where Elva, Liv, and Tilda were visible.</p><br><p>'What...? Was it looking at us the whole time? How strange, it feels like this raven isn't just a curious bird, it seems like it came here on purpose...'</p><br><p>Then, Elva shook her head.</p><br><p>'Nah, it just feels like that to me. After all, birds are always looking around, but... why its eyes are so unusual?'</p><br><p>It was a deep night, Elva could see the raven through a small part of the window, yet she was sure the raven's amber eyes had two pupils each. Enjoy more content from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Elva leaned forward, wanting to get a better look at the raven.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the raven's eyes grew deeper, it spread its wide wings and flew away.</p><br><p>Elva bit her lip, clenching her right hand tightly into a fist.</p><br><p>'Damn it! Why did I move from my spot, looking directly at it? Raven thought I wanted to attack it! Agh, okay, that's not what I should be focusing on right now.'</p><br><p>Trying not to think about the strange raven anymore, Elva leaned her head against the door.</p><br><br><br><p>A message came through on Gladius's phone, he cast a quick glance at the notification before hiding it.</p><br><p>'Oh, so that means he's going to be the second fighter? Curious, he has to take care of three younger siblings... Hah, that's not an easy task at all.'</p><br><p>Gladius's corners of his mouth curved into a sly smile.</p><br><p>'Her ways of seeking information are as exquisite and efficient as always. I will need to praise her, but more on that later.' Gladius looked at Adam, 'When this is over I will do whatever is necessary...'</p><br><br><p>"Alright, we have limited time left..." Zarot sighed, glancing at his watch, "125 million. This is my final offer, and you will only get your money if you win."</p><br><p>Fromund's eyes sparkled, he let out a short laugh before nodding deeply.</p><br><p>"Alright. I accept."</p><br><br><p>Fromund stood up and walked over to Zarot, and extended his hand.</p><br><p>"It is a pleasure doing business with you, higher nobles."</p><br><p>Zarot responded to his handshake with narrowed eyes.</p><br><p>"Don't forget, you must defeat Adam Vinter."</p><br><p>Fromund's gaze grew deeper.</p><br><p>"I will do that. I will do whatever it takes to pay off my debt faster so my sisters can live in freedom. They deserve it."</p>
