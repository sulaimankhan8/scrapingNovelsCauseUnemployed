            <br><p>Silvana, as an Operator, could find almost any information, however, even for her, there were some limitations, and everything took time.</p><br><p>It would have to be at least a few days before she could find out from the former prisoners of the Fall Hill Prison how things worked in this unusual place. novel-hosted-NovelBin</p><br><p>There was no other way for her to find out, since she had never worked at the prison and was just a normal person, nor did she have any Phantom friends who could tell her more.</p><br><p>It would have been a big help to Adam, but... in his case, things were moving too fast since he was stronger than most of the other Phantoms of his level.</p><br><p>Adam had been in prison for about two days, and that was including his long sleep after the fight with Krana and Trana. In that time he had managed to make it to the A-Zone, a place where most prisoners stopped and waited until their time was up.</p><br><p>Sure, a lot of people tried to go further to get their sentence reduced to one week, but getting to the S-Zone was hard. To pass the S-Zone... well... those who dared to do so faced an overly formidable challenge.</p><br><br><p>Edir emerged from the changing room, showing off the clothes he picked out.</p><br><p>"What do you think?" Edir asked, slicking his hair back.</p><br><p>Lola's eyes went wide, shining brightly. She hadn't realized that the right clothes could change Edir so much.</p><br><p>Out of the many choices and thousands of clothing items, Edir favored a loose, classic style with an acceptable amount of accessories.</p><br><p>A gray jacket, black vest, and white shirt tucked into wide dark pants and strangely enough... white sneakers... It seems that in terms of shoes, Edir couldn't choose beauty over comfort.....</p><br><p>On his left hand were two identical engraved rings, and on his right one was a wide, clean bracelet as if made of marble. Around his neck was a simple metal chain without any additional marks.</p><br><p>"Not bad, not bad at all, but..." Lola looked at Edir's sneakers, and her eye began to twitch, "Did you have to ruin everything for the sake of comfort?"</p><br><br><p>"Of course I did! Nothing is more important than comfort, though, as you can see, I'm willing to compromise." Edir said, pointing to the vest.</p><br><br><p>From a room a little farther away came Adam.</p><br><p>"Oh, I knew it would fit you perfectly!" The girl designer tilted her head, clapping lightly but not separating her palms from each other, just the tips.</p><br><p>"How strange..." Adam muttered. He was slightly puzzled since this was different from the usual casual clothes he always wore. That said, he was thoroughly pleased with the result.</p><br><p>"Something wrong?" The designer smirked.</p><br><p>Adam shook his head, casting a glance at himself in the mirror.</p><br><p>"Nah... I'm starting to get used to it... It was probably worth the whole hour we spent here, though... I'm seriously unconvinced about that." Adam scratched the back of his head, gazing at his new look.</p><br><p>The top was of a dense black material that encased his muscles, effectively showing every curve of his body that had been through many dangerous fights. It was a special material, so Adam didn't feel heavy or stuffy, since the breathability was excellent.</p><br><p>The pants were wide underneath, getting a little bigger towards the bottom, and then tapered sharply into black shoes - big, flexible, and sturdy enough to withstand all his sudden movements.</p><br><p>"Maybe some accessories?" The designer suggested with an obvious sparkle in her eyes.</p><br><p>Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>"I think that's enough. Let's see how I feel in battle." Adam muttered, stretching out his arms as if like an athlete warming up before a run or a long workout.</p><br><p>Adam didn't notice it, but it was obvious to Edir and even Lola that the girl designer was just devouring him with her eyes. She was clearly in awe of the way he looked.</p><br><p>'Agh... I tried the same style once too, but it doesn't suit everyone.' Edir inwardly sighed while shaking his head.</p><br><p>"By the way. If you like everything and want to buy the same set or maybe something new, then contact our design firm! We have our stores in all of Rings!" The girl uttered, holding out a business card to Adam.</p><br><p>Adam was puzzled, but soon... the realization came to him as to why everything at A-Zone was the way it was.</p><br><p>It wasn't just that Crimson Path and Dark Order interfered with the structure at Fall Hill Prison. Ordinary people and especially big businesses contributed to the system!</p><br><p>Sure, there were only twenty Phantoms in the A-Zone at the moment, but several hundred passed through in a year, and each such Phantom likely either already possessed a fortune or would do so in the near future.</p><br><p>Such clients were worth the risk of trying to provide their services in prison!</p><br><p>Yeah, in a way it was crazy, but not many people wanted to miss an opportunity like this.</p><br><p>Adam stepped forward, approaching Edir with a serious look.</p><br><br><p>Edir adjusted his collar.</p><br><p>"Yeah. Come on, let's go get a mint ice cream cone, and I'll tell you more about The Will. However... I'll have a favor to ask of you for that favor."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>"Sure. Say what you want."</p><br><p>Edir glanced at the black gate leading into the S-Zone.</p><br><p>"Obviously, after we talk, we'll proceed to fill in the cells in our cards."</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly. He wasn't going to stay at Fall Hill Prison one extra day. If he had a chance to get out today, he was going to do it, and he would try until someone or something stopped him.</p><br><p>"Then, whoever fills the three cells first, I want to be the one to challenge the Guardian of the A-Zone. I'm sure you've had enough fun with Trana and Krana. In my memory, you're the first to fight two Guardians at once." Edir smirked.</p><br><p>"The first? Yeah... but that was because of you. You had the cards of three zones at once, how did you do that?" Adam asked with obvious interest.</p><br><p>Edir lifted his chin arrogantly.</p><br><p>"You want me to tell you my secrets, right? Well, there's nothing complicated about it. I made it to B-Zone by simply suppressing all the Guardians with my aura. They didn't fight me since they had already lost to me, before, when I was here the first time."</p><br><br><p>"I was going to move to A-Zone, but that's when I got the message from Tron and went back, picking up random prisoners' cards on the way. That's about it."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, for he had realized something very important.</p><br><p>A prisoner from the F-Zone couldn't go to the B-Zone unless he defeated a few Guardians, but... if the prisoner was already in the A-Zone, he could move freely throughout the prison!</p><br><p>For Adam, this opened up a good opportunity to do something he had wanted to do for some time now.</p><br><p>'Narata... right?' Adam muttered inwardly, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, 'I may not be a psychologist, but the reason for your weakness is beginning to make sense to me, because... you're weak by choice. You certainly could be somewhat stronger. Well, I'll leave that for later.'</p><br><p>Then, Adam raised his gaze to Edir.</p><br><p>"Come on. Let's go, get your ice cream already. Tell me how to enhance your aura."</p><br><p>Edir narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>"Sure. As soon as possible."</p>
