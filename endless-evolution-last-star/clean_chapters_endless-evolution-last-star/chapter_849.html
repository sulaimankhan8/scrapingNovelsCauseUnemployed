            <br><p>A few minutes were enough for a quiet conversation to turn into something more serious - for example: a death threat.</p><br><p>Andreas kept a slight smile, the whole situation seemed to amuse rather than frighten him, people of his age appreciated any entertainment that could arouse sincere emotions.</p><br><p>"Oh, you want to kill me? I'm sorry to hear that, there's no point in you fighting me. I'll give you three Twilight Coins without a battle, you can be sure of that."</p><br><p>Without a hint of fear, Andreas waved his hand once again, revealing three identical coins. Outside the Twilight Palace, they had no value, even in a pawn shop, they wouldn't have any worth since the gold plating wasn't real.</p><br><p>However, inside the Twilight Palace, the coins were the most precious treasure, for it was the only way to freedom.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, he let go of Silvana's hand and stepped forward. The tips of his long hair trembled, ready to surge upward at the powerful energy pulse.</p><br><p>"Hmm... What if I try anyway? I'm sure if you have three coins, then you're carrying a lot more than that."</p><br><p>Then, Adam pointed sideways at the blue barrier.</p><br><p>"Maybe even the External Artifact will stop working. Who knows?"</p><br><p>Andreas nonchalantly spread his hands apart.</p><br><p>"Mr. Adam, I won't hide it from you. If specifically, you were a K4-Phantom approaching the limit of your evolution, I'd be in serious trouble, but..."</p><br><p>His eyes grew deeper as if trying to find out what state Adam's inner space was in, how mighty his energy was.</p><br><p>"I'm afraid that in your condition you cannot overpower me. Don't forget that you're exhausted, so you're far from the peak of your powers."</p><br><p>It seemed Adam should have thrown himself into the fight, but he didn't. Andreas hid a lot of things, but when he opened his mouth he spoke the truth - Adam realized that already.</p><br><p>'I can't break through the barrier. I don't know if it's the external artifact or someone else's ability, but it's very similar to what I saw at the Moon Colosseum.'</p><br><p>As he pondered, Adam looked at Andreas's sly expression, then at the three coins clutched between his fingers.</p><br><p>'Fuck... Douglas, the next time we meet, I'm going to make you regret this. Tsk, he insisted we accept his idea of the Twilight Palace because he knew what was going on here!'</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, Adam shook his head and pointed to the three coins.</p><br><p>"You said I needed five Twilight Coins to get out of here, is this place not a hotel but a prison?"</p><br><p>"Prison? Hah, Mr. Adam, once you've been to prison, I think you should understand that there is a great difference between this luxurious place," Andreas waved his hand, pointing to the tapestries covering the walls, "and a prison."</p><br><p>This didn't impress Adam, with a questioning look, he tilted his head.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you're right, I was in prison. If you were a strong Phantom, you could live there better than in luxury hotels. Andreas, it stresses me out that you know so much about me, but that's not what this is about right now."</p><br><p>Andreas nodded deeply, a slight, almost imperceptible smile invariably remaining on his face.</p><br><p>"Sure, seriousness in young men is always commendable. Anyway, this isn't a prison, it's a hotel, but I won't pretend I didn't guess what you were asking about. If we're talking about the northern part where all the events take place, then... this place has the most similarities to the arena."</p><br><p>With a deep nod, Adam accepted his words. He realized that if five coins were needed to get out, and three were given at the beginning, there had to be a way to earn two more.</p><br><p>Then, Adam lifted his chin, arrogance filling his eyes.</p><br><p>"You said it takes five coins to leave the Twilight Palace, but what happens if I lose three coins? Something bad will happen, right?"</p><br><p>Taking his time to answer, Andreas rolled the coins between his fingers with a thoughtful stare, he did so freely.</p><br><p>"The truth is, completely losing all Twilight Coins is also a path to freedom. There are no penalties, you can be sure of that."</p><br><p>At this point, Silvana decided to enter the conversation, Andreas's answer baffled her to the core.</p><br><p>"Then what's the point of trying to earn two coins if there's another way out?"</p><br><p>Andreas smiled bitterly, raising her head to meet Silvana's wide-open eyes.</p><br><p>"Because Adam won't be able to get rid of the coins simply by throwing them away. To lose a coin, you have to lose. Obviously, we have ways to keep track of which K3-Phantom has how many coins, otherwise none of this would make sense. However, you are one of not many who have thought of this option."</p><br><p>After a short pause, Andreas added:</p><br><p>"For others, this scenario is unacceptable."</p><br><p>A sharp question rang out from the side:</p><br><p>"Why?" Adam's voice was harsh, demanding a prompt answer.</p><br><p>"Because, you Adam, are one of the few who ended up here in the Twilight Palace because of your journey to Heaven Island. You came here by Douglas's offer, but others come here because they want to prove their power."</p><br><p>A strange feeling dawned inside Adam, as if he had been caught in this trap once before and he didn't like it.</p><br><p>"Others...?" Adam narrowed his eyes hostilely, "Who the hell are you talking about?"</p><br><p>"Oh, you're not going to like my answer."</p><br><p>Then, Andreas looked at Adam intently, he felt sorry that Adam was here out of choice, just a little.</p><br><p>"Adam, you know that the Twilight Palace is in the First Wing, right?"</p><br><p>With a growing grimace, Adam crossed his arms over his chest.</p><br><br><p>"Well, to answer your last question - it's simple, the Twilight Palace is a place for the new K3-Phantoms to test and compete against each other, as well as the nobles for whom defeat, forfeiture of all Twilight Coins is a great shame to them and their families."</p><br><p>Adam's face froze, he seemed petrified hearing about the nobles again, but Andreas wasn't finished.</p><br><p>"Especially the nobles for whom the First Wing is home - the nobles from the first four families of the Twelve Branches."</p>
