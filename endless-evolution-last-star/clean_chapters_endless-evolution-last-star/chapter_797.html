            <br><p>Silvana didn't know where she was. Lone Blaze and the Evolution Tree hadn't bothered to explain anything to her, but she knew one thing for sure - here somehow she could heal Adam's wound.</p><br><p>"Is there something burning in there? No... more like a source of blood. Fuck! I have to hurry!"</p><br><p>Not wanting to waste any more time, Silvana ran forward. With each step she took, she passed Adam's silhouettes, each with different wounds.</p><br><p>The more she paid attention, the better she understood the nature of the silhouettes.</p><br><p>'These wounds... They are familiar to me.'</p><br><p>Then, Silvana's eyes reflected one unique silhouette, like the others, that one was injured, but something set it apart from the others.</p><br><p>The silhouette was missing its right arm, a wound Silvana hadn't seen before.</p><br><p>An electric shock ran through her body as she remembered that Adam had once lost his arm during a fight.</p><br><p>She stopped abruptly, staring at the soulless silhouette with a deep stare.</p><br><p>"Wait... That wound, a perfect match to the aftermath of his fight against the Essence Thunder Demon."</p><br><p>Intuitively, Silvana reached out her hand, she wanted to touch the silhouette to convince her assumption.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, the silhouette abruptly came into motion, it bounced at the last moment, Silvana's fingertip almost reaching its skin.</p><br><br><p>Silvana was baffled, she didn't know what she did wrong.</p><br><p>The silhouette shook its head. Its eyes remained blank, but it knew that Silvana's help was needed elsewhere. The silhouette jerked its head toward the red star.</p><br><p>In the silence, Silvana nodded uncertainly. This place was scaring her, but she had to keep moving.</p><br><br><p>Ignoring the wounded silhouettes, she quickly ran forward until the light of a distant star engulfed her.</p><br><p>Silvana shielded her face with her hand, trying to make her way through the light until she reached her goal.</p><br><br><p>Saturated drops of blood dripped one by one from the black-haired young man's fingertips.</p><br><p>Another silhouette stood amid the red glow, the only real one - its wounds had yet to fade into history.</p><br><p>Silvana gasped at the sight of the mutilated hand, the wounds were identical to Adam's at this point.</p><br><p>Saying nothing, Silvana slowly walked around the newest silhouette, it wasn't the first, but could be the last.</p><br><p>"Looks like it's time to do what I came here, right...?"</p><br><p>She couldn't believe she was going to take that wound for herself, that she could do it, but it was the only way to help Adam.</p><br><p>With trembling legs in fear of the pain, Silvana hesitantly approached the silhouette, carefully taking Adam's hand.</p><br><p>Immediately, she felt an unusual flow of energy form between them, something she hadn't experienced before. It was like the twin currents of a river, moving water from one point to another.</p><br><p>A bitter smile formed on her face, the corners of her lips quivering as a nervous laugh broke out:</p><br><p>"Hah... Looks like there's still hope for me to be useful... I can't jump to conclusions ahead of time, I know too little about my role as Operator..."</p><br><p>She lowered her head, calmly awaiting the end of the process.</p><br><p>Twitch. Twitch. Twitch.</p><br><p>Adam's left arm twitched, gradually the bones were falling back into place, the lacerations of skin and flesh were healing and even the lost drops of blood that didn't have time to disappear into the darkness were heading for the veins.</p><br><p>It was unknown how much time passed, but the next time Silvana looked up, she saw that the silhouette was staring at her as well.</p><br><p>The last silhouette nodded slowly like a motionless statue, while its empty eyes filled with the familiar blue color.</p><br><br><p>The silhouette's palm was on her chest, throwing Silvana out of the inner space.</p><br><p>She blinked a few times, seeing multiple screens and her desktop in front of her.</p><br><p>"Argh...? I did it? I managed to heal Adam?"</p><br><p>Uncertainty filled her voice, everything was too strange, but she could only hope.</p><br><p>Suddenly, her eyes went wide, veins heavily covering her face. Instinctively, she glanced to her left, realizing there was a price to pay for everything.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, her left arm received the same damage that Adam had.</p><br><p>Then, for the first time in her life, Silvana felt how painful the open fractures were, the torn muscles with tendons and broken fingers.</p><br><p>She wanted to scream, but she had no strength to hold back in the face of the consuming agony, the mere sight of her arm twitching and mangled was unbearable.</p><br><p>Silvana gasped, a scream was ready to burst from her throat when darkness quickly engulfed her gaze, the view becoming a blur.</p><br><br><p>Without a sound, Silvana collapsed from her chair, the earpiece flew out of her ear and the microphone collapsed onto the table.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam heard something happen to Silvana. He immediately realized that for some reason she fell, as if someone sneaked into her house and attacked her.</p><br><p>"S-Silvana? What's going on in there!!!"</p><br><p>However, instead of her voice, he heard someone else.</p><br><p>[She's fine, you don't have to worry.]</p><br><p>Lone Blaze continued, a little embarrassed, yet everything was serious:</p><br><p>[You fool is lucky to have an Operator like her.]</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand irritably as if trying to get rid of her.</p><br><p>"Fuck! Shut up, I'm not talking to you!"</p><br><p>[I see... Just look to your left, didn't you still feel that?]</p><br><p>He didn't want to do it, but a feeling deep inside made him listen to Lone Blaze. Adam cast a glance at his mangled hand, it was his fault.</p><br><p>"Argh...? What the hell...?"</p><br><p>His eyes went wide, his voice shaking following the cold running down his back. His arm was intact, there wasn't a single scratch or bruise, all that was left was a bloody dried-up trickle and some dirt.</p><br><p>Adam tried to clench his hand into a fist, not believing what was happening. He did so effortlessly, his hand working the way it was supposed to.</p><br><p>"How is this possible...? Was it an illusion all along?"</p><br><p>Adam jerked his head sharply from side to side.</p><br><p>"No, the pain was real. Until a few seconds ago, my arm was in a terrible state."</p><br><p>Lone Blaze nodded her head deeply confirming his words.</p><br><p>[Silvana... She took that wound on herself and passed out due to the pain shock, but she won't be able to use that trick anymore.]</p><br><br><p>[You must win or her sacrifice will be for nothing.]</p>
