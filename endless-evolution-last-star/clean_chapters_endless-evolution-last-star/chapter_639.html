            <br><p>Everyone's first day of work was different, it was influenced by the person's attitude, working conditions, and of course, the work that needed to be done.</p><br><p>Waiter was one of the jobs that everyone knew about since childhood because to know what these people did one just had to go to any cafe or restaurant once.</p><br><p>So Silvana was well aware of what she was supposed to do and what to expect. Moreover, she had an advantage, it was her family's restaurant where she had been many times and was familiar with many of the workers.</p><br><p>"Well, it's time to get started." Silvana muttered, shook her head and with a serious look she headed towards the newly arrived customers.</p><br><p>Meeting their gaze, Silvana pulled out her phone and asked:</p><br><p>"Hello, may I take your order?"</p><br><p>The middle-aged woman smiled warmly.</p><br><p>"I'll have the pumpkin pancakes and green tea please."</p><br><p>The men sitting across from her nodded confidently.</p><br><p>"I would like your four-egg omelet with cheese and red beans in tomato sauce along with herbal tea."</p><br><p>That was the first order on the first day, then came the second, third, and so on.</p><br><p>In the beginning, like all newcomers, Silvana had some problems, but soon she got the hang of it, and waitressing became a routine.</p><br><p>One day, she was waiting for customers to take their orders and at that moment a wooden door opened, letting in two silhouettes.</p><br><p>On the left was an active and energetic girl with dark blond hair and brown eyes, her smile shining brightly while she was saying something to her interlocutor with prominent excitement.</p><br><p>Next to her was a tall man with short black, slightly spiky hair and green eyes. Unlike the girl, the man had a calm face, it seemed that his partner's vigor was a real challenge for him.</p><br><p>He had one means of coping with it - a large cigarette clenched between his teeth.</p><br><p>Seeing the two of them, Silvana frowned slightly.</p><br><p>'A young couple? Damn... most of the time they order two cups of coffee and take up space for hours and you can forget about the tip altogether...'</p><br><p>As a waiter with little experience, Silvana couldn't think of anything else.</p><br><p>That day, the weather was rainy, so both the girl and the man were wearing long coats, especially the man, his coat was heavy and looked very warm.</p><br><p>"Evor! Stop ignoring me! I told you such a cool story! Aren't you going to have any reaction!" The girl puffed up her cheeks, pulling the man by his arms.</p><br><p>Throwing a glance to the side, Evor sighed heavily:</p><br><p>"Ceska, this is the third time I've heard this... Just let me enjoy the silence... Damn, the weather is so nice today, but even heavy rain is no barrier for you."</p><br><p>"Ghm!" Ceska frowned and elbowed Evor in the side, but... even though her blow was serious, Evor didn't react in any way.</p><br><p>They sat down at a free table, almost every table was like that now, Ceska hung her coat on the rack. Evor stayed in his rain-soaked one, he was fine with it, only occasionally bringing a cigarette to his mouth to blow out a puff of thick smoke.</p><br><br><p>Silvana approached them as always with a serious face, she cast a hard look at Evor.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry, but we don't allow smoking here. If you want you can do it outside, but it's forbidden inside."</p><br><p>Before saying anything, Evor took another drag on his cigarette before slowly turning to Silvana, his eyes traveled over her from bottom to top.</p><br><p>"Oh, so young and already working, that's good. And about the cigarette... Well, rules are rules, right?"</p><br><p>Shrugging once, Evor crumpled the cigarette and tossed it into the nearest trash can.</p><br><p>"What will you order?" Silvana asked a question that had become routine for her by now.</p><br><br><p>"I'd like coffee and cheesecake, please! If possible, I'd like to add salted caramel as well."</p><br><p>Silvana nodded slightly, writing down her order. It was just as she originally thought it would be.</p><br><p>'Well... The couple ordered not only coffee but also dessert, that's progress.'</p><br><p>Evor thought for a bit before waving his hand.</p><br><p>"Hey girl, do you have any meat or maybe pies?"</p><br><p>Silvana tilted her head in confusion, she hadn't expected such a question. Then, realizing that she was being unprofessional she coughed:</p><br><p>"Sure, we have different kinds of meat, roasted, smoked, baked, and so on. The same goes for pies, we offer both sweet and not."</p><br><p>"Good. Then bring all the pies you have one by one and meat, as much meat and beer as possible!"</p><br><p>Silvana's first thought was to ask if they could pay for it all, but she realized that would be very tactless.</p><br><p>"I understand. The order is large so you'll have to wait a long time." Silvana said respectfully and bowed slightly.</p><br><p>Evor looked away, at the way the droplets crashed into the thick panes of glass, slowly dripping down.</p><br><p>"It's not a problem, I'd even say it's a good thing."</p><br><p>Slightly surprised, Silvana headed to the kitchen to give the cooks her order.</p><br><p>For the next few hours, Silvana served only their table. During this time, several other customers came into their restaurant, but they were taken away by other waiters.</p><br><p>Time after time, Silvana returned from the kitchen with trays full of food, half the cooks were working to quench Evor's appetite and they were struggling to keep up.</p><br><p>Evor was a calm monster eating everything in his path, neat and elegant, yet he could eat a quarter of a meat pie in one bite.</p><br><p>When the last order was taken away, Silvana sighed heavily and leaned on the counter, watching Ceska and Evor, their faces and interactions.</p><br><p>'How strange... I thought they were a couple, but the whole time they never once kissed, hugged, or caressed each other's hand. Isn't that what lovers usually like to do even in public places?' Silvana thought.</p><br><p>After another hour, Evor finally ate everything, then Silvana approached them to close the order:</p><br><p>Enjoy more content from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Will you be ordering anything else or do you want to pay the bill?"</p><br><p>Evor yawned widely, raising his arms high up.</p><br><p>"Nah, I'm full. Your food is great, I'll come again."</p><br><p>At the same moment, the long sleeves of his coat slid down, revealing the bracelet on his right wrist. Even then, Silvana knew full well what kind of device it was.</p><br><p>'NEP...' Silvana muttered internally, realizing that right now a Phantom was sitting in front of her, the first in her life.</p>
