            <br><p>Oddly enough, the first person to notice something was wrong was observer no. 1. She narrowed her eyes, staring intently at Adam's expression.</p><br><p>When his feet touched the ground she shuddered, watching his gaze full of delight, even though his whole body was covered in blood.</p><br><p>'What...? He's rejoicing? Reinz has practically killed him! One or two more series of attacks and he would be nothing but scraps!' she inwardly exclaimed in disbelief.</p><br><p>But, for some reason, she did not feel that Adam was in danger. As long as there was no mortal threat to the fighter, the observer had no right to interfere in the battle.</p><br><p>However, that was not the reason why she was worried because she was deeply convinced that everyone around Adam was in danger and not him.</p><br><p>This feeling had not come from logical reasoning, but from the fact that several times in her life she had witnessed something similar - from much stronger people than a simple K3-Phantom like Adam.</p><br><p>Then, the time for thinking came to an end, for from Adam came a bright, white light incomparable to anything even a morning sunbeam.</p><br><p>The silver needle was clutched tightly in his grip, while his other hand lunged forward.</p><br><p>Reinz's instincts screamed for him to dodge, so he did it as fast as he could. Moments before Adam was about to move, the fifth ring on Reinz's right hand activated, bringing it to half of his peak power.</p><br><p>White electrical discharges were absorbed by the shadow of Adam's hand falling on Reinz's face. The grip was strong, not allowing Reinz to do a thing about it.</p><br><p>Then, following the path, Adam moved on as the tip of the needle touched the barrier.</p><br><p>No one understood what Adam was going to do, or rather no one believed it, including Reinz.</p><br><p>'What...? What's going on? Does he want to break the barrier? But... Even I... with ten rings could hardly do that!'</p><br><p>The next thing Reinz heard was a loud cracking sound like broken glass. Before he knew it, Adam took a step forward.</p><br><p>The world around him became blurry, shards flew in front of Reinz's eyes, slowly as if they were moving faster than the wind.</p><br><p>In one of the shards, he saw his reflection, his wide-open eyes full of fear unknown to him.</p><br><br><p>Under the hundreds of stares of both nobles and spectators beyond, Adam surged forward holding Reinz tightly in front of him.</p><br><p>The silver needle was making its way far ahead. The barrier was only the first obstacle Adam broke.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Pieces of marble flew off to the sides, smashing against the grand walls of the luxurious hotel. One wall after another was crushed through by Reinz's sturdy back.</p><br><p>After all, this was the Citadel, not the Dead Lands. Even the strongest material but without a drop of energy couldn't be durable in front of the Phantom.</p><br><p>For this reason, the Twilight Palace's walls were protected by the External Artifact.</p><br><p>This was no barrier to Adam's path, it seemed no one could stop him.</p><br><p>The nobles and the North Arch were far behind, neither observer no. 1 nor Silvana had any way to affect what was happening.</p><br><p>Now it was only Adam and Reinz.</p><br><br><p>Through several shattered walls, Adam and Reinz flew out of the Twilight Palace.</p><br><p>For a second, Adam turned around to finally look at the majestic structure from the outside.</p><br><p>"Oh... I see... It is huge..." Adam muttered.</p><br><p>Four tall peaks like castle towers rose to the heavens, the walls supported by white columns with gold framing were the base of the hotel located at the crossroads of the territories of the four great families.</p><br><p>The southern part of the hotel faced the government lands, and some ordinary people wanted to visit the unique hotel in the entire Citadel.</p><br><p>Then, many figures appeared in the windows as they watched with fear as a white line flew out from the left side of the hotel.</p><br><p>This had never happened before.</p><br><p>At the Twilight Palace, there was the utmost security. Moreover, none of the common people knew that the young K3-Phantoms were fighting amongst themselves in the northern part of the hotel. It was a secret to most.</p><br><p>It was now obvious to the guests what was hidden in the northern part, where access was forbidden. Not that they didn't have guesses, but being sure was always better.</p><br><p>The power of the K3-Phantoms was frightening, especially when the battle was taking place in the middle of a city where ordinary people could get hurt, but even so, no one panicked.</p><br><p>The people at the Twilight Palace, guests and staff alike watched the white line moving straight towards the Alderran Family territories with deep curiosity.</p><br><p>The Alderran Family occupied most of the first wing. That didn't mean they had 50%+, the first wing was divided between four families, and there were also government and neutral territories such as the Twilight Palace.</p><br><p>However, the Alderran Family owned 30% of the first wing. If not including Heaven Island, it was probably the most valuable, most luxurious piece of the Citadel, a true paradise for anyone from the Third or the First Ring.</p><br><p>And now, this territory was invaded. Strangely enough, it was done by a member of the Alderran Family and Phantom who wasn't a nobleman at all.</p><br><p>Reinz tried to stop Adam, but everything was happening too fast. Even a lightning strike couldn't catch up with Adam as he moved along the path.</p><br><p>Then, Reinz's back slammed into a sturdy steel fence, this time he felt real pain because this fence was not made of ordinary steel. It had been brought from the Dead Lands as a sturdy defense for his family's garden.</p><br><p>'What...? We're already here?' Reinz couldn't believe it, 'How? How fast are you?'</p><br><p>At the same moment, two more rings on Reinz's left hand shone brightly. The situation became more serious because, unlike him, many of his family members were ordinary people. Someone had to be in the garden, and that frightened Reinz.</p><br><p>"You bastard! Stop!" Reinz angrily exclaimed, unleashing bolts of lightning at Adam.</p><br><p>Yet, the next thing he saw was a splash of water passing along Adam's shoulders.</p><br><p>'Agh...?' his eyes went wide, 'Are we at the lake already? It's in the center of the garden...'</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz disappeared beneath the surface, their hair rippling in the crystal-clear water, sinking to the very bottom.</p><br><p>The action of the path came to an end followed by a powerful explosion at the end point.</p><br><p>This gathered the gazes of all the Alderran Family members strolling through the park on this quiet evening.</p><br><br><p>The nobles hurried away from the lake, they were scared, because if it was an attack on their family, then ordinary people had nothing to do here.</p><br><p>But, only silence remained. Nothing was happening and even the trembling passed.</p><br><p>"What's going on here...?" the middle-aged man stammered.</p><br><p>"I don't know, but we have to inform the elders! This is an attack on our family!"</p><br><p>Someone hurriedly pulled out a cell phone dialing a number with trembling fingers.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, white electric shocks traveled across the surface.</p><br><p>Then, two figures flew out in different directions, one sparkling like a star and the other leaving a bloody trail underneath.</p><br><p>Adam crashed into the nearest tree on the left side, Reinz in turn landing deftly on his feet.</p><br><p>"Ouch." The girl gasped, dodging splinters, her hair white as snow.</p><br><p>Coughing up a clot of blood, Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>Lying amongst the oak broken in two, Adam turned around, and their gazes met.</p><br><p>"Hi, can you help me up...? Your brother, I guess, hit me pretty hard..." Adam held out his hand.</p><br><p>The girl didn't know if it was a request or a threat. Unsure, but she stepped forward.</p><br><p>Suddenly, an irritated shout came from the other side of the lake:</p><br><p>"Emilia, don't you dare go near him! It's dangerous!" Reinz ordered.</p><br><p>Before Emilia could react Adam abruptly stood up, walking past her like a ghost.</p><br><br><p>Without a threat in his voice, Adam walked towards the lake shore.</p><br><p>The nobles stared at him intently but hesitated to approach.</p><br><p>Adam felt auras light up in the distance. They were growing stronger by the second. The guards would arrive soon and then their fight would be over.</p><br><p>Reinz realized this, his teeth gritted in irritation.</p><br><p>"You! Why did you do that? No, how?" Reinz waved his hand, "You ruined our fight!"</p><br><p>"Hah..." a short laugh erupted from Adam, carrying darkness, "I ruined our fight? I don't think so. We don't have much time left, it won't be long before your elders really mess things up.</p><br><p>"But... That will be enough for me."</p><br><p>Without further ado, Adam raised his hands, once his grip tightened the needle shattered into shards.</p><br><p>Dark red flames took the needle's place, soon the ghastly blade of the crimson sword was revealed.</p><br><p>The energy from Adam's powers gene was about to take its form - gauntlet, helmet, cape, and shoulder pads, but as soon as the gauntlet began to form Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>"No, I don't need that right now." Adam muttered quietly.</p><br><p>Then, a frantic smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"Just pure fucking power!"</p><br><p>The crimson flame came out of the sword with renewed vigor as the veins in Adam's arms erupted releasing thin streams of blood.</p><br><p>His arms wouldn't be able to hold out for ten seconds.</p><br><p>But to take one swing he needed far less than that.</p><br><p>"Watch out." Adam smirked before bringing the sword down.</p>
