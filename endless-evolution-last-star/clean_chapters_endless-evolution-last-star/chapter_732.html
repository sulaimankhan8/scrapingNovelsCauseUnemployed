            <br><br><p>With a slight crackle coming from the breaking crystals, the Dormant Lord slowly stepped forward as he exited the Crystal Gorge.
</p><br><p>Thanks to the work of the five Diamond Servants, he didn’t have to worry about the safety of his domain. True, while he was here no one was going to even come close to the crystals full of energy, but very soon he would temporarily leave his territory.
</p><br><p>At that very moment, the monsters who considered themselves strong and agile would try to seize the crystals, but the Diamond Servants would be impassable guards and ruthless reapers for them.
</p><br><br><p>Climbing the sharp peak atop the Crystal Gorge, the Dormant Lord looked ahead.
</p><br><p>One of the Diamond Servants that guarded the top of his domain immediately knelt before her master.
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord paid no attention to her, he was only interested in the bright, red flashes in the distance clustering over the fortress, growing larger by the second.
</p><br><p>Then, he slowly turned his head to watch the Conqueror Flame Raider, the flame trail remaining behind while the active ripples filled his subordinates with a powerful aura.
</p><br><p>Although the Dormant Lord had the Diamond Servants and the other monsters in Crystal Gorge obeyed him, there was a strong difference between him and Conqueror Flame Raider as they were monsters of different Types.
</p><br><br><p>Powerful streams of wind reached the Crystal Gorge, shattering against the sharp tips and the high walls.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, every Flame Raider and other monsters enhanced by the Conqueror Flame Raider unleashed their energy on the fortress and the Lands of the Lone Serpent.
</p><br><p>Dozens of red flashes flew downward, fiery projectiles smashing into the dark solid walls, filling the passageways inside with cruel flames.
</p><br><p>Yet, besides the three Commanders, the fortress had four other defenders - the One-Eyed Serpent Archers.
</p><br><p>Realizing the gravity of the situation, the four archers worked together. Soon, purple flashes began to fly out from the side of the fortress, powerful high-speed arrows destroying one flying monster after another.
</p><br><p>Under the war cries of the squad commanders, the Phantoms also joined the fortress defenses. In any other situation, they themselves wished to take the Stronghold, but now the solid walls were their only defense against the long Eclipse.
</p><br><p>From time to time, multicolored rays collided with red ones, streams of energy flying chaotically apart, then they were shot down by the next projectile over and over again.
</p><br><p>What was the Dormant Lord thinking?
</p><br><p>If his goal was to destroy the fortress, he could do it now. Last time it took two powerful arrows to destroy his spear, now the archers had no chance to react to his attack.
</p><br><p>Yet, for a long moment, the Dormant Lord was not looking at the fortress, there was no one of note to him except Katrin, his gaze was directed much higher.
</p><br><p>The Flame Raider circled above the fortress, slowly raising his broad wings. From time to time, he opened his beak, launching blazes of flame at random monsters and Phantoms running across the dark sand.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>A slight shiver rippled through the Dormant Lord’s body, his fingertips twitching as if he were very angry.
</p><br><p>His aura intensified, unleashing a merciless pressure on the Diamond Servant, she was unlucky to be near him at a moment like this.
</p><br><p>Arrogance and haughtiness - only the truly powerful ones could use it, the Dormant Lord knew it well, it was the rules he adhered to.
</p><br><p>Yet, the Conqueror Flame Raider acted as if his arrival was solely enough to take over the fortress and kill all the competitors who, unlike him, could not fly.
</p><br><br><p>The Dormant Lord’s aura abruptly returned to normal as he nodded weakly, pondering his next steps.
</p><br><p>At the next flow of wind, the Diamon Servant hesitantly raised her head. She didn’t have permission to do so, but she wanted to see if her ruler was alright.
</p><br><p>But... the Dormant Lord was no longer at the top, he vanished like a shadow, expressing both his freedom and trust to his subordinates as he left the Crystal Gorge.

</p><br><p>"Don’t relax! Attack with everything you have! As strange as it may sound, we must help the archers defend the fortress! Right now, the flame raiders are our biggest problem!"
</p><br><p>Katrin exclaimed with a wide sweep of her arm. She was still in front of the bridge, fighting the monsters of the first wave.
</p><br><p>Every time she swung her broad sword, clots of blood and flesh chunks flew off to the sides.
</p><br><p>Now and then Phantoms ran alongside her, following the bloody path that she and her fellow squad commanders cleared.
</p><br><br><p>"Damn! We made it at the last minute."
</p><br><br><p>Katrin stepped forward cutting another monster in two, then something caught her eye. A bright flash appeared and disappeared in the farthest part of the hills, moving quickly northward.
</p><br><p>Then, her eyes went wide in disbelief.
</p><br><br><br><p>Whooosh. Whooosh. Whooosh.
</p><br><p>Moving in snow-white flashes, shaking the ground with his powerful strides, the Dormant Lord ran in a straight line. The other monsters didn’t even have time to notice him, they only felt a powerful aura appear for a moment before disappearing just as quickly.
</p><br><p>Yet, some of the stronger ones sensed the real threat beforehand.
</p><br><p>The Grim Warro turned his head, staring intently at the Dormant Lord who was rushing straight at him.
</p><br><br><p>With a heavy wheeze, the Grim Warro leaned his torso forward, preparing for a deadly fight, yet... soon confusion covered his face.
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord raised his right hand up, pointing directly at the Conqueror Flame Raider circling high above.
</p><br><p>After a second, it reached Grim Warro, as his serious face was replaced by a devious smirk.
</p><br><br><p>With an excited laugh, the Grim Warro thrust his hand deep into the ground.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, on the Dormant Lord’s path, several knolls appeared out of the sand. Tall wood pillars sprang out, nine of them, each successive one much taller than the last, reaching a height comparable to the towers.
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord showed no reaction to the Grim Warro, he only jumped on the first pillar in a few leaps to the last.
</p><br><p>Then, streams of white energy covered his body, giving his legs great strength.
</p><br><br><p>The ninth pillar cracked, shattering into splinters with the most powerful jump the Dormant Lord was capable of.
</p><br><p>In a vivid flash, the Dormant Lord flew dozens of meters upward, eventually ending up right in front of the Conqueror Flame Raider.
</p><br><p>The eagle’s eyes went wide, the Conqueror Flame Raider couldn’t believe that this was real.
</p><br><p>Then, a strong fist shaking with an array of energy descended upon Flame Raider, intending to bring him down from heaven to earth.</p>
