            <br><p>The first time, the energy transfer took some time. The Evolution Tree and the Evolution Seed were connected in one path like a thread, so even the boundless darkness couldn't become an obstacle.</p><br><p>Soon, Adam's eyes stopped shining brightly, the same thing happened every time he used his abilities, but... this time, nothing changed.</p><br><p>He hadn't noticed it yet, but deep in his and Silvana's eyes there was a faint, almost unnoticeable glow, it could easily be mistaken for a gleam.</p><br><p>Silvana smiled slightly before lifting her chin confidently.</p><br><p>"Adam, close your eyes, preferably cover them with your hands."</p><br><p>The strange request confused Adam, but he realized that of those present he was the only one who didn't know the effects of the Gene Diffusion yet.</p><br><p>As it should be, he was left alone in the darkness, thanks to the extra cover, Adam couldn't see even the light.</p><br><p>"So... Adam, what do you see now?"</p><br><p>"Agh? Isn't it obvious? I don't..."</p><br><p>Adam said irritably but stopped at the last moment.</p><br><p>"Wait... What the hell..."</p><br><p>A second ago, there was only darkness in front of him, but now, for some reason, Adam saw himself. It wasn't his imagination, for when he lifted his left leg he saw it as if someone was standing in front of him and filming him and he could see everything through the camera with his own eyes.</p><br><p>Then, the realization came to Adam, his confused smile replaced by a satisfied one.</p><br><p>"Damn, I see what you see. That's pretty cool. And..." Adam fell silent, immersing himself in his inner space.</p><br><p>He ran his gaze over his Evolution Tree, the energy flowing inside like a powerful river, and turned to the thread coming out of the trunk disappearing into the darkness.</p><br><p>"There is virtually no energy wasted. We can go on like this for a very, very long time if we want... it will be hours before I feel any wasted energy at all."</p><br><p>Silvana nodded, deep inside she was glad that Adam was pleased with the change, but that was only a small part of what she was aware of.</p><br><p>"Yes, and... it works both ways."</p><br><p>Then, Silvana closed her eyes, covering her hands to make sure she couldn't see anything.</p><br><p>Refesa cast a steady gaze at Adam and shook his palm with two curved fingers.</p><br><p>Realizing their intent, Adam asked:</p><br><p>"Silvana, what is Refesa holding in her hand?"</p><br><p>Discover stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>The corners of her lips went upward.</p><br><p>"A tricky question, but I see the same thing you do. She's not holding anything, she's pointing three fingers, and... Ms. Refesa, you should update your manicure."</p><br><p>Refesa snorted irritably.</p><br><p>"Shut up. Better show him the next new thing."</p><br><p>Then, she looked at Adam.</p><br><p>"In the beginning, you'll be unaccustomed to using the shared sight, but you'll get used to it pretty quickly. Moreover, as you already realized, you can use this ability at any time and also in two directions. That is, you choose who sees what."</p><br><p>With an ironic smile on her face, Refesa shrugged.</p><br><p>"Sure, Silvana will use it most of the time, but if she suddenly needs help, you can see everything going on through her gaze."</p><br><p>Adam nodded, directing his gaze to Silvana.</p><br><p>"So, what's next? The shared sight must not be the only advantage of the Gene Diffusion, or I'll be upset." He realized that this was just the beginning, the first step, but he wanted more.</p><br><br><p>Silvana took a few steps forward before placing her hand against her chest. Soon, a bright flash appeared under her palm, sending a wave of energy through Adam.</p><br><p>It had never happened before, something from the outside trying to connect with his Evolution Tree, with his energy, at first he felt rejection, but soon he realized it was a friendly energy, almost a kin.</p><br><p>The same flash but brighter appeared in Adam's chest before they both extinguished simultaneously.</p><br><p>In that instant, Adam saw Silvana's silhouette from different angles and distances, but not just as a spectator, but as if he were trying to track her location, and he quickly succeeded.</p><br><p>Now, for each other, they were like bright beacons whose light they could see no matter the distance and accurately determine their location.</p><br><p>Adam opened his eyes, he was still a little confused.</p><br><p>"This is all useful and pretty cool. I mean, now if something happens to the devices, Silvana will be able to tell me while I'm in Dead Lands, but... is there anything else?"</p><br><p>Then, Silvana and Refesa glanced at each other. It seemed like they were purposely showing Adam something useful but not very spectacular at first.</p><br><p>"Sure." Silvana nodded and assumed a fighting stance, "However, just like last time I need your permission. After all... it is your energy, I am only its carrier."</p><br><p>"Hah, you didn't ask my permission before, though... Given the circumstances, I agreed to all of this."</p><br><p>Soon, their eyes glowed again, but this time Adam's light was quickly gone, and Silvana's energy only increased until it began to spill in waves throughout her body.</p><br><p>In a moment Adam frowned heavily as the energy grew more and more, Silvana's skin cracked, revealing white splits.</p><br><p>'What the hell... Fuck! I have to stop this now!' Adam internally exclaimed intending to stop the energy transfer.</p><br><p>He could cut it off at any time, but not Silvana, she was the receiver since the Evolution Seed was getting its energy directly from Adam's Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>But, the Evolution Tree refused to honor Adam's order.</p><br><p>[Don't be nervous... Do you think that after everything that happened... I'm going to let her die like this...?]</p><br><p>And... Adam wasn't going to listen to his Evolution Tree either, he just wanted to stop the process so that Silvana would return to normal.</p><br><p>However, it wasn't long before it was already over.</p><br><br><p>Silvana gasped as all the energy returned to the center, quickly extinguishing like a young flame.</p><br><p>Her legs trembled, but she didn't let herself fall. Soon, her posture recovered, and her eyes reflected a lone needle for a moment - strongly reminiscent of Adam's Initial Gene.</p><br><br><p>A gust of energy ran along her arms as she clenched her fists tightly and ran straight at Adam with serious intent, showing that she was ready to fight him.</p><br><p>'Really...?' Adam inwardly chuckled, watching Silvana's quick but clumsy stride.</p><br><p>With a slight sigh, Adam spread his arms out to the side, smiling faintly.</p><br><p>"Go ahead, show what you can do - my Operator."</p>
