            <br><br><p>Silvana’s fist slammed right into Adam’s chest, she didn’t hold back in speed or strength, trying to replicate the illusion the Evolution Tree had plunged her into.
</p><br><p>However... illusion would always be just an illusion, a pathetic copy unable to surpass and even more unable to replace reality.
</p><br><p>Was Silvana’s punch strong or weak?
</p><br><p>Well, everything was relative.
</p><br><p>For a mere human, her punch was too strong. Even Max, using all his experience and strength, wouldn’t be able to produce something so powerful and fast, despite the incredible difference in their mastery as two fighters.
</p><br><p>It was also proof that Silvana was actually using energy that was not available to normal humans, which she wasn’t 100% from now on.
</p><br><p>Silvana was still human, hundreds of times more so than Adam and any other Phantom and even more so monsters, but humans couldn’t use energy, especially other people’s energy.
</p><br><p>This was a unique position the Operators held after Gene Diffusion.
</p><br><p>For a Phantom, even a K0, Silvana’s punch was...
</p><br><br><p>Adam grinned widely, enjoying Silvana’s deadly serious face.
</p><br><br><br><p>Silvana bounced back, intending to attack again. Sure, she didn’t know how to fight at all, all she had was above-average physical training.
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, before Silvana could realize anything, Adam was behind her and gently slid two hands around her waist.
</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Silvana’s body as she swung her leg with a face as red as a tomato.
</p><br><p>Without difficulty, Adam stopped her by grabbing her ankle firmly.
</p><br><p>"Hah, I was just kidding, no need to be so embarrassed." Adam smiled innocently, though there was still a predatory glint in his eyes.
</p><br><p>Refesa rolled her eyes, shaking her head from side to side.
</p><br><p>’Agh... It’s not Phantom and Operator, it’s two kids.’
</p><br><p>There was nothing more Silvana could do Adam, so she lowered her leg and stepped back. Moreover, in this short clash, Silvana wasted a lot of energy, she would be able to continue further if necessary, but Adam’s stamina was far from her.
</p><br><p>"How would you rate my fighting ability?" Silvana asked, her face showing the seriousness of her intentions.
</p><br><p>At first, Adam wanted to make a joke, but he quickly dismissed the idea - it would be an insult to Silvana’s certainty.
</p><br><p>"That’s very weak for a Phantom, but you’re not a Phantom. I’m sure if you gave an ordinary military man that level of power, he could defeat any White Threat monster."
</p><br><p>"I see..." Silvana nodded deeply.
</p><br><p>Then, Refesa entered their conversation:
</p><br><p>"You shouldn’t think of this as a way to become a fighter against monsters, it’s unrealistic and impossible. However, this ability will make Silvana stronger in emergency situations, as well as increase her health."
</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana turned towards her, they saw that Refesa was not finished yet.
</p><br><p>"It is natural that Silvana has the opportunity to become stronger for a short period since she now has your energy, Adam. However, the most appropriate description would be that it is a platform, for the future."
</p><br><p>In a moment, Refesa’s gaze grew colder, directed at Adam.
</p><br><p>"Have you forgotten that the main reason Phantoms go for Gene Diffusion is to get a chance to move on? Without the Gene Diffusion, you can’t become a K3-Phantom, and your Operator will play an important role in that."
</p><br><p>Adam gulped. Though he was aware of that, his thoughts were occupied with other things right now.
</p><br><p>"Right, that’s a very important part..." He muttered, what awaited him after the First Wall was still shrouded in mystery.
</p><br><p>Sensing that she pushed it too far, Refesa waved her hand.
</p><br><p>"Alright, that’s not what you should be thinking about right now, you have other challenges before this and... also Silvana has something else to show you, this is the last one."
</p><br><p>Oddly enough, this time it wasn’t just Adam who looked surprised, but Silvana as well.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, the Evolution Tree is hiding it, doesn’t want to put too much strain on your body."
</p><br><p>Refesa smirked, looking at Silvana.
</p><br><p>"But... Why waste time when you can do it here and now?"
</p><br><p>With a look full of uncertainty, Silvana turned to Refesa:
</p><br><p>"What... I have to do?"
</p><br><p>"Oh, it’s nothing complicated. Just repeat the same thing Adam did."
</p><br><br><p>Refesa shrugged, pointing at Adam.
</p><br><p>"It’s very simple. You used his energy before. Nothing is surprising or wrong with that, but you have energy now too, don’t you?"
</p><br><br><p>Confusion covered Silvana’s face, her lips quivering slightly.
</p><br><p>"It’s not like it’s my energy, my seed is attached to Adam’s Evolution Tree."
</p><br><p>"Yeah, you’re dependent on Adam. If something happens to him, like he dies, you’ll lose your energy supply."

</p><br><p>Silvana’s face turned pale for a moment. Even in a horrible nightmare, she wouldn’t want to see Adam’s death, but Refesa spoke of it calmly and nonchalantly, to her it was one of probability.
</p><br><br><p>Adam inwardly sighed heavily, his gaze deepening.
</p><br><p>’I’m a Phantom, statistically speaking there’s always a chance of me dying in Dead Lands. Although... haven’t Phantoms like Damien and other Second Rank ones gone through thousands or more battles along the way? They clearly don’t fit into the statistics.’
</p><br><p>While Adam was immersed in thought, Refesa finished her explanation:
</p><br><p>"Yet, although Adam is to some extent your progenitor, the inner space containing the seed is yours, isn’t it?"
</p><br><p>Refesa grinned widely.
</p><br><p>"Just release all that energy outward, and then you’ll know what to do."
</p><br><p>Taking a few seconds to think, Silvana nodded, deeply and closed her eyes, staring intently at the seed.
</p><br><p>For a long moment nothing happened, anxiety reappearing deep inside Adam, but soon everything fell into place.
</p><br><br><p>Silvana’s eyes shone brightly, and her hands moved on their own, following not her mind but her instincts.
</p><br><p>She held her hands out at waist level, holding them out in front of each other with her fingers outstretched. Light energy emerged from the tips, and multiple streams slowly but surely transformed into a tiny sphere.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The evolution seed shuddered, generating a spark inside the sphere - it became a bright star hovering amidst Silvana’s hands.</p>
