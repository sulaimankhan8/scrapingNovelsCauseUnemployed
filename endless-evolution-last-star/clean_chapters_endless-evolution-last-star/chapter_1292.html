            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1292: Ureyn, the Grim Wind (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Two pillars of light, bright and clear, along with a ring hovering above the ground, were visible from afar across many territories and even regions.</p><br><p>The Glass Bridge and the dark forest were no exception to this rule.</p><br><p>Garrah, who was busy restoring the forest, stopped for a few seconds, simply staring at the light that was familiar to him.</p><br><p>“Adam, so you achieved your goal, right?” He smiled faintly. “Well, all I can hope for is that you win. Defeats can make you stronger and have their advantages, but nothing compares to the victory that comes when it is needed most.”</p><br><p>Kara and Toa did not have as friendly a relationship with Adam as Garrah did after defeating the Red Bloom, but they could not hide the fact that this young man had impressed them. He had earned the approval of their boss and passed all the trials.</p><br><p>“Tsk, the String Duel?” Kara bit her lip in annoyance. “I wonder who his opponent is?”</p><br><p>Toa thoughtfully touched her chin, tilting her head. “It must be someone strong. The Connected String wouldn’t let him fight someone too weak.”</p><br><p>Kara and Toa continued to discuss their theories when, deep beneath the bridge, the ancient creature opened its eyes once more.</p><br><p>“Hmm… So it’s the String Duel, right? I see… It’s not just about strength at the moment, but potential. Considering what you’re capable of, Adam, your opponent’s ambitions are certainly no less than yours, and most likely exceed yours due to the age difference…”</p><br><p>Then, Targon closed his eyes, patiently awaiting the outcome of the battle Adam had been striving for for so long.</p><br><p>He had learned about the Connected String quite some time ago from Damien, but a series of events and deep reflection prevented him from going to the Forgotten Mills that very day.</p><br><p>However, this was probably the best outcome for him because if he hadn’t defeated Bathild, he wouldn’t have received the Memory Fragment, which means he would have been much weaker than he is now.</p><br><p>In that case, the Connected String would not have led him to Ureyn, he would not have been one of the suitable options, and therefore, this battle would not have taken place.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The light ring trembled, rising higher and higher above the ground like a halo, expanding with a tremor until its edges touched the two pillars.</p><br><p>A barely visible barrier appeared around Adam and Ureyn, forcing everyone to step back. Nollura and Norax, who were standing close to them, were forced to step back as the barrier expanded until it reached the boundaries of the wind plain.</p><br><p>Sure, if Norax had wanted to, this barrier would not have affected him, but he had come here to watch the battle between two talented young men, not to show his strength.</p><br><p>Nollura waved her hand as she exchanged one last glance with Ureyn, hoping for his victory, even though she understood that it would be a difficult task.</p><br><p>Unlike the Rule of Power, where Adam’s last duel took place, no one was placing bets here. All the monsters of the Forgotten Mills came here for the spectacle and to see what one of them was capable of in battle against the unusual Phantom.</p><br><p>Ureyn frowned, sensing how powerful Adam’s aura was.</p><br><p>“Well, when I realized it was the String Duel, it became clear that it wouldn’t be easy. Let’s see what you’re capable of, Adam Vinter.”</p><br><p>Making the first move, Ureyn stepped forward and spread his arms to the sides, gathering streams of wind inside them.</p><br><p>Adam gulped, watching his opponent’s actions. He didn’t know what to expect, and that increased his excitement.</p><br><p>Soon, the sphere of wind trembled and burst in an instant, revealing a long object with a sharp blade and a comfortable handle.</p><br><p>It took Adam only a split second to realize what it was — a needle.</p><br><br><p>Ureyn swung his needle, sending gusts of wind toward Adam.</p><br><p>His needle was different from Adam’s. First, it was gray, much longer, with a sharp tip, and clearly could control the gusts of wind swirling around its blades. The handle was long enough for Ureyn to hold his needle with either one or two hands for powerful but slow attacks.</p><br><p>Slowly moving in for a direct attack, Ureyn aimed his needle straight at Adam.</p><br><p>“Go ahead, show me what you’ve got. Considering that you’re a Phantom and that I’m your opponent in the String Duel, your abilities should be diverse but similar to mine.”</p><br><p>At that moment, his gaze darkened.</p><br><p>“You have a needle too, right?”</p><br><p>Adam’s heart beat faster as the corners of his lips curved upward.</p><br><p>“Yes, you’re right. Unfortunately, I can’t control the wind as easily as you, but I think I can surprise you.”</p><br><br><p>With a tremble, Adam waved his hand, summoning the first needle, which looked unusually large compared to Ureyn’s.</p><br><p>Ureyn glanced at Adam’s needle and nodded slightly.</p><br><p>“I see, so you’re one of those who keep fighting no matter what? You have an aggressive fighting style, don’t you?”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam faltered. “You came to that conclusion just by looking at my needle?”</p><br><p>In response, Ureyn nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“For the most part, yes.” He pressed his needle to his chest. “Sure, I could be wrong, because you’re a Phantom, and there are very few like you in this world. But at the Gray Needle, the appearance of your needle is a reflection of yourself. Something tells me that I’m not wrong about you.”</p><br><p>Adam wanted to say something, but Ureyn didn’t give him the chance. His frame trembled as he appeared right in front of Adam.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Ureyn made several quick swings with his needle, intending to wound his opponent first.</p><br><p>Thanks to his experience, Adam realized that he simply couldn’t block or dodge all the slashes, so he jumped back as fast as he could.</p><br><p>With a slight delay, the gray lines sliced through the air, leaving deep cuts where Adam had just been standing.</p><br><p>He gulped as Silvana’s voice echoed in his head, reflecting his thoughts.</p><br><p>‘Adam, he’s dangerous… This fight won’t be easy. Any delay will cost you a deep wound or even defeat.’</p>
