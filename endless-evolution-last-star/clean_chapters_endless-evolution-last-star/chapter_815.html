            <br><p>Adam’s inner space was a special place, like any Phantom it housed his power and the Evolution Tree.
</p><br><p>However, Adam was faced with an unusual problem. Two new creatures were now in his inner space, neither of which he expected.
</p><br><p>Unlike Moira, Lone Blaze looked confident and even somewhat cocky.
</p><br><p>She threw one leg over the other like sitting on an invisible cushion amidst the vast darkness. At the same time, Moira was trying to hide behind a red cloud, the only thing left from the Crimson Monarch.
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze started first:
</p><br><p>"Just look at him, confused. It seems you didn’t expect such a change after another mission for you, right?"
</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly, he shrugged nonchalantly.
</p><br><p>"I won’t hide the fact that I’m confused. I was ready to see her here," he looked at the timid Moira, "But... You... Why do you even look like a human? Are you a woman?"
</p><br><p>With a slight smile, Lone Blaze stood up and headed towards him.
</p><br><p>"I took this form because I’m more comfortable interacting with you this way. You’re not the first human and monster I’ve seen, so when choosing between a man and a woman, I preferred this shape. It’s just the way I feel following my desires."
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze waved her hand:
</p><br><p>"You can think of me as human or monster, it won’t affect anything since I am the External Artifact, truly... now I belong to you."
</p><br><p>Despite her words, Lone Blaze didn’t blush or look embarrassed. She was serious since Adam’s inner space was now her only home. She lost her fortress and her physical form.
</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, Lone Blaze dropped to one knee in front of him and lowered her head not daring to raise her gaze.
</p><br><p>"Adam, our paths are now inseparable. Even on this day, after a long battle you still have a lot of work to do, but... let me be first on your list. I want to give you what’s yours."
</p><br><p>Then, a bright glow emerged from Lone Blaze’s chest, followed by a stream of flame. In chaotic waves, the fire clot soared in front of Adam, condensing rapidly.
</p><br><p>He blinked as his eyes reflected a scarlet star, bright as the sun, fierce and powerful, ready to give all its flame to Adam.
</p><br><p>[The Artifact Star received.]
</p><br><p>As soon as the mechanical head sounded in Adam’s mind he moved into the depths of his space finding himself in front of the Star Seal.
</p><br><p>The last upper cell trembled slightly, ready to receive the final star.
</p><br><p>Adam didn’t resist. After all, this was what he wanted.
</p><br><p>"Hah... What a strange feeling..."
</p><br><p>He muttered watching the Artifact Star slowly move.
</p><br><p>"I came to the fortress to simply destroy the First Wall, but... I ended up accomplishing that and many other more difficult tasks. I wonder what I’ll have to do to create the Second Key."
</p><br><p>Though Adam always tried to think of his current goals without pushing too far into the future, he never forgot that the Two Walls were the main challenge but not the last.
</p><br><p>The two keyholes on his lock were still not open, for that he needed keys. He remembered that it took him a lot of resources to create the First Key last time, but he didn’t think he would have to do the same.
</p><br><br><p>With a thud, the Artifact Star ended up in the Star Seal, filling the last, fourth cell.
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam felt a wave of energy fill his body, just as he had when he inserted the three cells.
</p><br><p>But, that wasn’t what he was paying attention to.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The Star Seal shuddered, the symbols tracing the lines to the center accelerated while the starry mist slowly dissipated.
</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes hoping this time to see what was behind the fog.
</p><br><br><p>Strangely enough, all he saw was a snow-white star, pure and majestic, bright enough to dazzle the whole world.
</p><br><p>Even the darkness of his inner space seemed to want to escape from the vibrant light.
</p><br><p>Then, the flash illuminated Adam, plunging him into a dreamlike state.
</p><br><p>The next moment when Adam opened his eyes he was back in the upper level of his inner space, Lone Blaze and Moira were there as well as the Evolution Tree.
</p><br><p>The light fell on Adam’s face as he raised his head, watching the Star Seal, a seal with four stars, moving straight towards the center of his Evolution Tree.
</p><br><p>Adam’s fingertips trembled, he didn’t know what was happening, but the anxiety inside him didn’t let him watch quietly.
</p><br><p>However, the powerful voice of the Evolution Tree soon sounded:
</p><br><p>[Calm down... Everything is happening as it should... Look, Adam, this is the result of the destruction of the Two Walls.]
</p><br><p>The Star Seal stopped in front of the Evolution Tree, its center aimed at Adam’s Initial Gene. Fear filled Adam’s heart, he thought that the Star Seal was going to change his Initial Gene, but this was not what he wanted.
</p><br><p>His worries were in vain, the Star Seal had another purpose, to do something that never happened before - expand the limits of his Initial Gene.
</p><br><p>The four stars emerged from their cells, in lines heading towards the white, main star. In a heartbeat, the white star absorbed all their energy, increasing the pressure on the Star Seal to the limit.
</p><br><p>With a space-shaking blast, a dense beam full of runes rained down on the Initial Gene. The power was comparable to the Crimson Monarch’s attack destroyed part of the fortress.
</p><br><p>Now, it was his Initial Gene who was taking all that power.
</p><br><p>’Fine... This is how it should be, right?’ Adam internally muttered, trying to calm himself down.
</p><br><p>Suddenly, his face contorted with a searing pain coursing through his body.
</p><br><p>Not expecting such a piercing attack, Adam’s legs trembled as he collapsed to the ground.
</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, Lone Blaze appeared behind him. She held him by the shoulder, preventing him from falling into the abyss.
</p><br><p>"Get ready Adam, this is going to hurt a lot... You’ve never felt anything like this before and you hardly want to."
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, while the beam continued to rain its energy on the resisting Initial Gene, Lone Blaze closed her eyes, clutching Adam tighter to her. She was ready to hear shrill screams, that would be normal in this situation.
</p><br><p>But... there was no cry from Adam.
</p><br><p>His pupils trembled, his teeth gritted at the risk of erasing into dust, spasms passed through his muscles, but he didn’t want to shout.
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze blinked a few times bemused.
</p><br><br><p>Soon, came Adam’s hoarse voice.
</p><br><p>"My Evolution Tree... it’s going through the same pain as me right now, isn’t it?"
</p><br><p>"Sure..." Lone Blaze nodded uncertainly as she looked up, "You share the Initial Gene, after all, it is the beginning of your power, everything else is just a follow-up."
</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.
</p><br><p>A loud crunch sounded from the center of the Evolution Tree, cracks covered the Initial Gene, under the pressure of the beam it could shatter into pieces.
</p><br><p>But, the purpose of the Star Seal was not to destroy the Initial Gene, so now the energy had finally found its place, actively filling the cracks like liquid metal, once it cooled down, it would become part of the weapon, and there would be no trace of the damage.
</p><br><p>The cracks, getting bigger and bigger, the energy immediately filled the cracks, continuing the endless cycle.
</p><br><p>In just a few seconds, the cell of the Initial Gene in the Evolution Tree became too small to hold the growing gene.
</p><br><p>Fissures began to crack in the dense bark, while the Initial Gene grew larger and larger, pushing the boundaries of the bark to make room for itself.
</p><br><p>For a moment Adam forgot about the pain. He felt the same as the Evolution Tree, oblivious to the last bits of the beam.
</p><br><br><p>Adam hesitantly stepped forward, he didn’t need Lone Blaze’s encouragement anymore because the pain was over.
</p><br><p>The Star Seal shuddered from time to time, losing its bright light, it gave all its power to Adam’s Initial Gene.
</p><br><p>Completely turning gray, the Star Seal shattered into hundreds of fragments, flying in all directions in farewell.
</p><br><p>A few pieces like ash flew before Adam’s eyes, showing that his path as a K2-Phantom was almost complete.
</p><br><p>Unable to hold back his curiosity, Adam looked up at his Initial Gene.
</p><br><p>No global changes occurred with his Initial Gene, other than a significant increase in size and an intimidating energy density.
</p><br><p>Rare flecks of light reflected in the cracks of the bark, perhaps not today or tomorrow, but the Evolution Tree would recover its wounds.
</p><br><p>Adam’s lips quivered, analyzing the strange feeling.
</p><br><p>"Damn... It’s like all the bones inside me have grown, yet perfectly fit to my build, it caused quite a bit of pain."
</p><br><br><p>Keeping a slight smile, Lone Blaze approached Adam from behind, her hands falling gently on his shoulders.
</p><br><p>"Now your Initial Gene has grown enough to accommodate more than just your energy. Adam... I’m afraid you’ll have to share the space, for your Initial Gene will be my new home."
</p><br><br><p>Lone Blaze cast a glance at Moira.
