            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1339: New Resonance</strong></p><br><p>Adam finally learned what his purpose was. He understood that sooner or later Norax would ask him for a favor, but he had no way of knowing what it would be, at least until that moment.</p><br><p>At the very beginning of his journey, he received his first artifact, right after he became a Phantom. Then, it was the turn of the External Artifact, Lone Blaze, which became his loyal ally and helped him in the battle against the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>But, the Ancient Artifact?</p><br><p>That was a whole different level. Powerful enough, the Ancient Artifacts retained their freedom of action even when on the territory of someone like Norax. This showed how strong they were and that Adam had no chance of subjugating the Ancient Artifact or even resisting its will.</p><br><p>However, before heading to the Silver Beacon, Adam needed to prepare.</p><br><p>Thanks to Silvana, he had finally completely rebuilt his Energy Axis, which meant he had reached his full potential.</p><br><p>His new ability remained a secret that Silvana did not tell him about. She was waiting for the right moment to use the Imaginary Cut, or more precisely, another part of the Evolution Vein.</p><br><br><p>Norax moved in a calm stride in a circle, while Adam watched his every move closely, waiting for a sudden attack that would inevitably happen sooner or later.</p><br><p>He had gone through Narica, Karso, and Misty, all of whom were formidable opponents, but could they be compared to Norax himself?</p><br><p>‘Tsk, I can’t believe I’m afraid of him like a rabbit before a wolf.’ Adam clenched his fists tightly with a great frown.</p><br><p>It was clear that Adam was now capable of dealing with most Elders, even those who were at the Dark Shore or in the depths of the Tarnished Lands.</p><br><p>It seemed unsurprising that Norax’s aura frightened Adam, but… for their small battle, the last one before the Silver Beacon, Norax had lowered his power to the Lesser Elder level, basically to the lower limit of the Black Threat Level.</p><br><p>Even though Adam was now superior to Norax in level, his mere presence was enough to make Adam tremble.</p><br><p>“What? Waiting for me to attack?” Norax smirked. “You know, I can do that right now.”</p><br><p>No tricks or deception, Norax immediately lunged forward, but as soon as his foot touched the ground, he vanished, reappearing directly behind Adam.</p><br><p>Norax had used this move before, so Adam was somewhat prepared. Still, it would hardly be enough.</p><br><br><p>Fists rained down on Adam as his eyes flashed brightly, trying to see every moment in detail.</p><br><p>He blocked and deflected Norax’s fists, not missing a single blow, but only because he was faster and stronger in terms of power.</p><br><p>If Norax had raised his strength to Adam’s level, their fight would most likely have already been over.</p><br><p>“Come on, Adam! Is that all you’ve got? I thought you’d reached your peak!” Norax exclaimed as thick darkness descended upon his feet. “You know that’s not all I’m capable of, right?”</p><br><p>At the same moment, Norax began to move faster, forcing Adam to go into full defense mode. He put his hands up to block Norax’s fists, but he couldn’t keep it up for long.</p><br><br><p>Norax stepped forward, raised his knee, and kicked Adam straight in the stomach.</p><br><p>“GHA!” Adam gasped as Norax’s leg plunged into his stomach like a spear, leaving him no time to react.</p><br><p>The impact threw Adam several meters back, but Norax was already behind him, touching his shoulder.</p><br><p>“I’m here, Adam.” He grinned, bringing his fist back for another attack.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened, and the world slowed down for a moment. He saw that there was no way he could dodge this attack; Norax’s fist would surely smash his face. It would be a blow strong enough to end their fight right then and there.</p><br><p>‘No, am I not capable of dodging a single blow? I can do it. I have enough strength for that.’</p><br><p>The impulse ran through the Energy Axis, affecting not only the Evolution Tree but the Evolution Vein as well, which Silvana felt.</p><br><p>“Ah?” She flinched as the electric shock passed through her.</p><br><p>Simultaneously, two streams of energy headed toward the top of the Evolution Tree, activating one of the long-lost abilities that Adam had discovered in himself during his first battles—the Resonance.</p><br><p>At the Twilight Palace, where Adam fought against the nobles from the Twelve Branches, he and Silvana discovered the Stellar Resonance.</p><br><p>Now, it was time for the next step. Adam’s energy had never been at such a high point as it was now, and Silvana had strengthened her position in the inner space because part of her energy was now aligned with the Energy Axis.</p><br><p>Without her knowing it, Silvana’s eyes shone brightly, and now two four-pointed stars appeared in both of her eyes. The same thing happened to Adam, whose energy burst out in all directions in a majestic white flame.</p><br><p>The Stellar Resonance gave way to a greater form of power—the Dual Resonance, reflecting not only the two stars but also the fact that this power now belonged to both of them.</p><br><br><p>Norax’s fist shot forward, but instead of Adam’s face, it only reached the air, leaving a short cut on Adam’s cheek with his knuckles.</p><br><p>“Oh, not bad,” Norax smirked as he looked at Adam’s wide-open, brightly shining eyes. “Not bad at all. So you already have enough energy for this? You and your Operator know each other well, right?”</p><br><p>He tried to attack again, but this time Adam was faster. The difference in their levels had become too great.</p><br><p>Before Norax could realize it, Adam grabbed his shoulder and slammed Norax to the ground with a sharp movement.</p><br><p>“This time, I’ll win!” Adam proclaimed that golden energy covered his fist.</p><br><p>Like a hammer, he slammed his fist into Norax as a stream of dust and debris gushed from the ground.</p><br><br><br><p>Like a cannonball, Adam flew out of the smoke screen, crashing into the mill at tremendous speed.</p><br><p>Norax nimbly got up from the ground and nodded approvingly.</p><br><p>“Good, it’s almost ready. A few more days and we can head to the Silver Beacon!”</p>
