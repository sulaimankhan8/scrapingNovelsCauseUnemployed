            <h4>Chapter 1357: Amber Orb</h4><br><p>Even if the enemy was much stronger than you, you still had a chance to win.
</p><br><p>Was the enemy’s armor too strong? Invulnerable to even your most powerful attacks?
</p><br><p>Well, then you had to attack somewhere else. A knight clad in heavy armor was invulnerable to simple slashing and stabbing attacks, but if a blade slipped into a slit in his helmet and pierced his eye, the fight would be over quickly, even if his opponent was a weak boy in dirty rags.
</p><br><p>To some extent, Adam had just done the same thing.
</p><br><p>Before the Crystal Golem had time to get used to his new power, the energy that flowed through his body in a powerful stream, Adam took all necessary measures to prevent a fight between them.
</p><br><p>Sure, maybe somewhere in the arena there was a hidden weapon that would help Adam defeat the Crystal Golem or, conversely, defend himself from the imps and glass cannons.
</p><br><p>But what did that matter now?
</p><br><br><p>The Crystal Golem’s sliced body collapsed to the ground as blood flowing from the flesh hidden beneath the stone layer gushed to the surface in powerful streams.
</p><br><p>"Agh..." Adam exhaled hot steam as his whole body was on fire, still, he smiled quite happily, well aware of what he had just done.
</p><br><p>Maybe it wasn’t the real Lord, and the Crystal Golem wasn’t ready for such a sudden attack, but the fact remained – Adam had killed a creature that was several levels stronger than him.
</p><br><p>"Hah... Haha... HAHAHAHAHA!"
</p><br><p>He laughed out loud, looking up at the sky as if he knew where Bertrada was, certain that she was watching him now.
</p><br><p>"What do you say? You clearly didn’t expect me to pass this trial this way, did you?" The corners of his lips turned up. "Otherwise, you would have strengthened this piece of stone at the very beginning, as you did before. Some people need to learn from their mistakes!"
</p><br><p>Somewhere at the very top of the White Spire, on a sloping stone tower rising from the ground in the middle of a dark island, a furious shout erupted.
</p><br><p>"Bastard!" Bertrada exclaimed, wanting to go down and strangle Adam herself, to do everything she could to wipe the smirk off his face.
</p><br><p>However... barring special circumstances, she couldn’t descend into the territory of the trials. She was forced to remain at the top of the White Spire, in the gray tower, basically above the island.
</p><br><p>Sure, she still had a lot of power, especially in the glass sphere from where she watched everything that happened on her territory. Still, as Adam correctly guessed, Bertrada had her limitations.
</p><br><p>"How did he do that? K4-Phantom defeated a Lord Level monster? FUCK! Even if it was an artificial enhancement, the difference in power should still be too great for that to happen!" Bertrada exclaimed, pounding her fist on the table.
</p><br><p>Mona, who had been standing aside all this time, was just as shocked as the Silver Beacon, her mistress.
</p><br><p>However... She understood very well how Adam was able to do it.
</p><br><p>’That’s terrifying. If he had hesitated even for a moment, the Crystal Golem would have had time to adapt, but still... He destroyed the golem’s eye, literally climbed into his skull, and cut him open from the inside.’
</p><br><p>Mona’s face turned pale.
</p><br><p>’Shit, if our powers were on the same level, I wouldn’t want to face a Phantom like him. Do all his battles go this way?’
</p><br><br><p>Even for Adam, this was beyond the lengths he usually went to in order to win.
</p><br><p>But what choice did he have?
</p><br><p>The eyes were the Crystal Golem’s only weak point, and as long as he could reach them, he had to take advantage of the opportunity.
</p><br><p>"Agh. What do you say, Silvana? That was something, right?"
</p><br><p>Silvana appeared beside him and nodded slightly. She couldn’t remember the last time she had seen Adam covered in blood from head to toe. What’s more, it didn’t seem to bother him at all.
</p><br><p>"Yes. I barely had time to react to your actions. It was... wild."
</p><br><p>Adam shrugged as he looked at the orb floating above the ground.
</p><br><p>"This is what we need. I’m sure of it!" He jumped up and grabbed the amber orb like a ball. It was heavy and large, still carrying energy.
</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Silvana touched her chin thoughtfully. "We need to find a way out, but maybe we need to look for the trial item as well?"
</p><br><p>Adam glanced at his coat.
</p><br><p>"Are you talking about the dark fragment? Do you think I won’t get it if I don’t find the special item needed for this trial?" Adam grinned, tossing the amber orb like a ball. "Hah, I broke the rules by killing that golem on my own!"
</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head.
</p><br><p>"I think everything will be fine. You didn’t break any rules, at least technically. However, I’m sure the Silver Beacon clearly wasn’t ready for this. I doubt many contenders could defeat the guards by choosing the amber crystal."
</p><br><p>In high spirits, Adam headed forward, looking around.
</p><br><p>He was in no hurry because, despite how confidently he had destroyed all the glass cannons and defeated the Crystal Golem, this time he had expended a lot of energy. He needed at least an hour to recover.
</p><br><p>After about twenty minutes, Adam stopped in the middle of the forest as he noticed something in the distance.
</p><br><p>"Here!" Adam rushed forward, crossing the forest grove.
</p><br><p>As soon as he broke out, he saw a massive stone platform with a round depression in the center. High stone peaks and wide trees with dense crowns hid this place.
</p><br><p>However, if Adam had paid attention to it during the battle when he was hovering above the ground, he would have easily noticed this unusual place. At that moment, he had other priorities.
</p><br><p>"Well, I guess this is our way to the next trial?" Adam grinned as he looked at the amber orb that was clearly designed to be placed in the center of the platform.
</p><br><p>At that moment, the sky trembled, preparing for his ascent to the next trial, where Bertrada would try her best to make him lose.
</p><br><p>Unfortunately for her, she had already made a mistake by choosing this trial as the third one.</p>
