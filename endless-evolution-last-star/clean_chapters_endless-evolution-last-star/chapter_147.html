            <br><br><p>The kicks continued, each time causing a light explosion of blue flames, particles of which flew apart, freezing the ground around.</p><br><p>Lorko no longer had the strength to scream, he just waited with a pained look until his agony finally stopped.</p><br><p>No one expected events to unfold this way, because... Edir had just broken some very serious rules.</p><br><p>Adam had challenged the Guardian of the D-Zone, so no one was supposed to interfere in their fight. However, Edir decided that he could disregard that rule.</p><br><p>Moreover, Lorko... the Guardian, was not strong enough to counter Edir even once. All his attempts were helpless and couldn't make Edir even tense up.</p><br><p>For a crushing victory, Edir only needed to use his Order, his physical strength, and blue flames to overwhelm the Guardian.</p><br><p>Soon, Edir stopped, took a deep breath, and pulled a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket.</p><br><p>Most didn't pay much attention to it, but... where did Edir get cigarettes from? Perhaps they could be obtained in future zones, but the F-Zone and D-Zone simply didn't have cigarettes, and neither did another item...</p><br><br><p>Edir opened the lighter, holding the cigarette up to the vibrant green flame, a few seconds was enough for thick streams of smoke to head upwards.</p><br><p>"Agh... That was refreshing..." Edir muttered before swinging his fist, taking out the blue flames.</p><br><p>Then, an unpleasant sound came from the speakers mounted in the walls, as if someone was adjusting a long-term unused microphone.</p><br><p>[Prisoner N#... no... Edir, you broke the rules by attacking a Guardian who came out to fight against another prisoner. You probably know what that means, don't you?]</p><br><p>The mechanical voice spread throughout the D-Zone, causing some prisoners to flinch.</p><br><p>They realized that only Prago could handle Edir quickly, which meant... he would be coming here soon!</p><br><p>However... Edir wasn't worried at all. His gaze was calm and collected, but not because he was going to fight Prago. No, he had another plan.</p><br><p>Even if he was strong compared to the other K1-Phantoms, against a K2-Phantom, he didn't stand a chance. The difference in power was too great.</p><br><p>"Yeah, I know how things work, that's why I prepared myself. I mean... I attacked Adam's opponent, so... it'll be fair if he attacks mine, won't it?" Edir said nonchalantly, glancing to the corner of the room - right into the small black camera.</p><br><p>[What are you talking about...?]</p><br><p>A mechanical voice said uncertainly.</p><br><br><p>"Come on. You should know where I got this from." Edir picked up the pack of cigarettes, then he returned it to his pocket and pulled out something else.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, and a wave of shock spread throughout the D-Zone, for in Edir's hand was a blue card with '999' points!</p><br><p>[You want to challenge the Guardian of the C-Zone to a fight...?]</p><br><p>A mechanical voice anxiously asked.</p><br><p>''Yeah, Adam will fight my Guardian because I fought his one. That sounds fair, doesn't it?" Edir slowly wiggled the card, practically touching his bracelet.</p><br><p>[Yes... In that case, it'll be fine. It's none of my business, but it's not good to do that. You're forcing Adam to fight a stronger opponent because of your act].</p><br><p>Edir shrugged as he cast a hard look at Adam.</p><br><p>"Don't bother. You don't realize it, but I sense that Adam as well as myself, is starting to get annoyed at the lack of a worthy opponent. Am I saying all the right things?" Edir turned to Adam.</p><br><p>Adam said nothing, he just clenched his fists tightly. He wasn't a mad berserker who was ready to throw himself at every man he met for blood and battle, but... His desire for a new power was obvious and unconcealed.</p><br><p>Without Edir's prompting, he had already realized that he had to master the aura power himself, after all... no one had helped him when he went through the Elemental Circle or received his Initial Gene.</p><br><p>"Still... I'm sure it won't be enough to give Adam a real challenge." Edir yawned widely, waving his blue card.</p><br><p>[What...? What the hell are you talking about?]</p><br><p>The mechanical voice was baffled.</p><br><p>Then, Edir, with a sudden movement, hid the card in his sleeve like a skilled trickster. Even the Phantoms couldn't see anything, his speed and timing were flawless.</p><br><p>After a second, Edir swung his hand again, clasping two cards between his fingers, one purple and one blue....</p><br><p>'What the hell...?' Adam internally muttered in disbelief. After all, this meant that Edir was already not only in the C-Zone, but also in the B-Zone!</p><br><p>Before anyone could realize anything, Edir tapped two cards to his bracelet, challenging two Guardians to battle at once.</p><br><p>Perhaps any prisoner Edir had set up like that would have felt pure resentment or even hatred toward him. After all, because of Edir, Adam would have to fight two powerful Guardians from the next Zones!</p><br><p>novel-hosted-MvLeMpYr</p><br><p>However... that didn't apply to Adam.</p><br><p>Lola's eyes went wide from gazing at Adam, who had an anticipatory smile on his face, and a confident look.</p><br><p>His aura was hidden, but everyone could sense on an instinctive level that Adam was ready for battle, and the only thing that mattered to him was that his opponent was strong!</p><br><p>Moments merged into seconds, then turned into minutes until the blue gate opened again, revealing two silhouettes of identical height.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, both Guardians were girls that looked suspiciously like each other. One had bright pink long hair and blue eyes, while the other had toxic green hair with azure eyes.</p><br><p>Their clothes were the same colors as their hair and eyes, quite mottled and eye-catching.</p><br><p>"Twins...?" Adam muttered puzzled, he hadn't expected the two Guardians to look so much alike.</p><br><p>Edir nodded with a wide grin on his face.</p><br><p>"The one with the pink hair is Trana, and the one with the green hair is Krana. I'll tell you a secret, Krana is a bit stronger." Edir said, whispering the last words as if no one was supposed to know except Adam.</p><br><p>Krana frowned, casting a disdainful glance at Edir.</p><br><p>"Tsk. Do you think this is a secret? Obviously, I'm stronger since I'm Guardian of the B-Zone!" Krana said confidently, placing her palm on her chest.</p><br><p>"Not true! You just got lucky during the test!" Trana frowned, like any twin trying to prove she was better than the other.</p><br><p>Krana waved her hand nonchalantly, an arrogant smile appearing on her face.</p><br><p>"Calm down. Your older sister will take care of everything. You, as the younger one, don't have to worry. I'll handle all our problems." Krana said proudly.</p><br><p>Trana's veins swelled as she clenched her fists tightly.</p><br><p>"You're only three minutes older than me! Damn it!" Trana exclaimed furiously, "Stop mentioning it all the time! Three minutes is just three minutes! It doesn't mean anything! You just got lucky!"</p><br><p>"Hahahahaha, you don't have to get so stressed out about it." Krana smirked. She was clearly enjoying teasing her sister.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>However... A powerful pressure spreading like white flames made her look away.</p><br><p>"Hey... Did you come here to sort out sisterly problems or to stop a prisoner?" Adam said menacingly, ready to fight.</p><br><p>Krana and Trana instantly got other faces and prepared to fight.</p><br><br><p>Edir jumped high up, finding himself on the second floor next to Lola. Then, he quickly ran forward and returned seconds later - with two chocolate milkshakes in his hands.</p><br><p>"I was late for the last fight, but I'm fully prepared for this one!" Edir smiled, passing one milkshake to Lola.</p><br><p>"Thank you..." Lola whispered modestly.</p><br><p>"Hmm... Sometimes a missed opportunity in one moment can turn out to be a fortunate moment in the near future, right? I mean, I'd rather drink this milkshake while watching the Adam vs Trana and Krana fight, because it'll be much more interesting than Adam vs Lorko, right?" Edir uttered, with a slightly curious face.</p><br><p>"I don't know... I guess you're right..." Lola scratched her cheek uncertainly.</p><br><br><p>Krana and Trana opened their black cases, revealing their Nexuses.</p><br><p>Expectedly, their Nexuses were almost identical, with only minor differences.</p><br><p>Trana had a long battle scythe with a straight blade, while Krana's scythe had a curved blade, perfect for tearing the flesh of their enemies.</p><br><p>"By the way... Before we begin. Did you both ignite your Spark at the same time? Simple curiosity. This is the first time I've met twin Phantoms, you know." Adam shrugged.</p><br><p>Krana quickly replied, poking her thumb at her chest.</p><br><p>"Hah, I did it a month early! It's no surprise though, since I'm the older sister!" Krana was proud of this.</p><br><br><p>He had thought that if one twin was a Phantom, then the other would meet the same fate, but Krana and Trana were just one of the rare examples of both twins becoming Phantoms.</p><br><p>Moreover, the delay between the appearance of their Sparks was negligible.</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, and his eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>'They are strong, though they behave eccentrically. Fine, with their help, I can awaken my aura!'</p>
