            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1502:  Detached Mountains (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>All Phantoms knew that to reach territories or carry out missions, they needed transportation. For the weakest Phantoms, these were simple trucks that moved around the Citadel in the nearest areas.</p><br><p>Then, fighter jets came into play, and the stronger the Phantom became, the more advanced and faster fighter jets they got to use. Their time was valuable, and the mission department did everything possible to transport them to mission zones within hours rather than days.</p><br><p>But, over time, even that became insufficient.</p><br><p>To help the K3 and K4 Phantoms, the Citadel built spires on the borders of distant territories. Each spire had a teleport, a more complex device that used anomaly energy to cover huge distances almost instantly.</p><br><p>The spires had only one drawback—there were so many of them that the Citadel couldn’t protect each one. That’s why the spires were located on the borders of the Dark Shore or Tarnished Lands rather than within their territories.</p><br><p>In the past, this was more than enough for Adam. He used the teleport to get as close to his destination as possible and then set off on his mission.</p><br><p>However, on his last journey, this method proved ineffective. He had to pass through several territories to reach the Forgotten Mills, not to mention that after that, he went to Izardo, and that was only part of his mission.</p><br><p>Adam understood that the Citadel was unlikely to have anything better than teleports.</p><br><br><p>“The Detached Mountains?” Adam stared at Silvana, trying to understand what was going on.</p><br><br><p>“Yes, Damien said, for you and Alexia to wait for him there. You have to be there in three hours, so I would hurry if I were you.”</p><br><p>“Wait, where are these mountains?”</p><br><p>Silvana placed her tablet on the table, showing him a 3D map of the Pacific Lands.</p><br><p>“You can get there by any means available. You can run there, use a truck, a fighter jet, or a teleport. I don’t know what you’ll choose, but I advise you to make a decision now.”</p><br><p>“Hmm…” Adam rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “The Detached Mountains. There’s something special about them, right?”</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply as her gaze became more serious.</p><br><p>“I couldn’t find any information about them. What you see now is only available to us because Beth gave me a special key. Even so, all we have is a simple marker on the map so you know where to go.”</p><br><p>She pointed to the blue 3D map, right to the place where the Detached Mountains are located.</p><br><p>“I thought I could outsmart Beth, so right after this discovery, I looked at satellite images from several different satellites that were looking at this area. However, there is nothing there. It’s just cold ground with a thin layer of snow covering an endless expanse, nothing else.”</p><br><p>Obviously, Adam and Silvana understood that Damien and Beth were not mistaken about the coordinates. It was obvious that the Detached Mountains were deliberately hidden from weaker Phantoms, as well as the military and ordinary people.</p><br><p>“Hah, another secret?” Adam smirked.</p><br><br><p>“It seems so. I talked about it with Louis, and he told me that he heard about this area for the first time as well.”</p><br><p>“Damn, Alexia and I created the First Grand Star and Second Grand Star. We are going to create the Third Grand Star, and we still don’t know that much about the Citadel? Just a few days ago, we learned about the Azure Island, and now some invisible mountains await us!”</p><br><br><p>“It’s just as you say. To be honest, after the World Wipe and the First Star, I thought there were no more secrets left for us in this world. Well, I was very wrong, and I don’t even know if that’s good or bad.”</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand as he walked to the window, looking at the Citadel in the morning. The city wasn’t as bright and lively as it was in the evening, but it was much quieter.</p><br><p>“I’ll walk there. It’s in the same area where the K1-Phantoms usually hunt, right?”</p><br><p>Silvana nodded. “Yep. The Blue Threat Level Monsters are the most dangerous enemies you can encounter there. Although… This is where the Detached Mountains are located, and it’s pretty empty. There are almost no missions for young Phantoms there, and there are no monster nests either.”</p><br><p>“Hah, so those mountains are definitely there. But why there?”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” She gave him a questioning look. “What do you mean?”</p><br><p>Adam pointed upward.</p><br><p>“The Azure Island, the Heaven Island, the First Ring, the Zero Day Vault, and the Lower Ring. They are all in a vertical line. I mean, that’s the only way Queen Elisa can protect all the most important parts of the Citadel during the World Wipe. So, why are the Detached Mountains outside the Citadel?”</p><br><p>Silvana’s corners of her mouth lifted. She liked Adam’s analysis. That was what she usually did.</p><br><p>“So there’s something there that was impossible to move to the Citadel, or it was too dangerous. In any case, we should take advantage of this opportunity if it helps you get to the Primal Lands.”</p><br><p>“Hah, you’re right.”</p><br><p>A few minutes later, Adam was ready to leave as the elevator door opened in front of him.</p><br><p>Silvana saw him out, but at the last moment she asked:</p><br><p>“Adam… About Alexia. Do you think you two will make a good team? Your mission with Fromund went great, but this is a completely different case.” Her voice betrayed her concern for him.</p><br><p>However, Adam grinned broadly.</p><br><p>“Don’t worry. Maybe it’s too confident, but the one time I fought alongside Alexia was enough for me to understand what kind of warrior she is. Also, don’t forget. She has followed the same path as I. She is no less strong than I am.”</p><br><p>In response, Silvana just nodded silently as she watched the elevator doors close.</p><br><br><p>Less than half an hour later, heavy gates opened before Adam, one of the ground exits from the Citadel usually used by newcomers and squads.</p><br><p>Somewhere far away, the Detached Mountains awaited him, but for now, he was going to enjoy the view of the lands from which he had once begun his journey.</p>
