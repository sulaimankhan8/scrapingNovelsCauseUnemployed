            <br><p>Adam's pupils narrowed as he took a step forward, putting his needle out for defense.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Damien's rod and Adam's needle collided, throwing aside cascades of sparks flying before their eyes.</p><br><p>As Damien anticipated, Adam's needle was sharp, he felt that if his rod had been less durable, it would have broken already.</p><br><p>"Good, you could block the first attack, but what about this one?" Damien smirked before unleashing a hail of strikes at Adam from different angles and varying speeds.</p><br><p>Adam sighed, letting his body move on its own.</p><br><p>It would still be a while before he got used to his new powers, both abilities and physical capabilities, but his mind realized what he was capable of.</p><br><p>'How fast... If I moved at this speed, I would be able to fight against Plague Reaper without amplification. But... there's someone much stronger in front of me right now, isn't there?' Adam pondered while blocking Damien's countless attacks.</p><br><p>If an ordinary person who hadn't seen any battles was watching their fight, all he would be able to see were the black flashes coming from Damien, his hands moving too fast.</p><br><p>However, Adam had no trouble keeping up with Damien's pace. He didn't have a chance to counterattack, but he could see Damien's movements, which was already a success for him.</p><br><p>"Well, well, looks like I underestimated you. Damn, I'm going to have to use energy and abilities to defeat you or I'll soon run out of breath." Damien said maintaining the pace of his attacks.</p><br><p>Adam's corners of his lips went up. The praise from Damien gave him confidence.</p><br><p>Then... Damien stopped.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam's eyes grew wider as he stared at Damien in confusion, as he stopped attacking for no valid reason.</p><br><p>Damien smiled weakly.</p><br><p>"Hah, I'm just kidding."</p><br><br><p>Damien's silhouette disappeared as he appeared behind Adam. Simultaneously, a crunch sounded and Adam felt bright flashes of pain, as if someone had shot him right through his body.</p><br><p>Trying to keep track of Damien's movements, Adam's eyes twitched sideways, to the left, only to be filled with fear.</p><br><p>It wasn't about Damien, it was about what Adam saw.</p><br><p>His arm was broken in several places and twisted at an odd angle. After a second, Adam looked down, his left leg was in the same condition, it looked like it had been caught in a crusher, mangled and incapacitated.</p><br><br><p>Adam fell to the ground, his gaze was shocked, he couldn't believe that this had actually happened. Moreover, he didn't understand how Damien did it without energy and ability, it scared him the most.</p><br><p>"Alright, 1 - 0!" Damien exclaimed with an excited expression as he threw the rod onto his shoulder. He didn't seem to see anything wrong with the situation.</p><br><br><br><p>Silvana gasped, looking at Adam's wounds. They were gruesome, his flesh was torn and parts of his bones were coming out. Damien clearly wasn't holding back or trying to act carefully, he just turned Adam's left arm and leg into a horrible mess.</p><br><p>"What the fuck...? Isn't this supposed to be friendly sparring? Why did he do that?!" Silvana exclaimed furiously, glaring at Damien with hatred.</p><br><p>No matter that Damien was one of the most important persons to the Citadel and all of humanity, now Silvana was ready to burn him with her gaze to avenge what he had done.</p><br><p>Douglas said nothing. He raised an eyebrow, surprised that Damien had done this, but something in his gaze showed that this situation would not become a tragedy.</p><br><br><p>While Adam tried to deal with the pain and get up off the ground to continue the battle, the mechanical doors opened again.</p><br><p>A tall girl in tight white clothes stepped inside. Her shoulders were exposed, showing her delicate skin.</p><br><p>Her eyes were a unique amber color, like gems that everyone wanted to possess, and her hair was blond and short, reaching only to her chin.</p><br><p>Damien turned around, meeting the girl's gaze.</p><br><p>"Oh, Dahla, you came just in time."</p><br><p>Dahla looked at her NEP, checking the time, then bowed low with a calm face.</p><br><p>"Mr. Damien, I'm sorry I'm late. I timed it wrong." Dahla said without daring to raise her head.</p><br><p>Damien waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Never mind. Even if you were late, you came at the right time. Get on with your work or soon I'll start feeling embarrassed in front of Adam."</p><br><p>Dahla glanced at Adam, who despite his gruesome wounds leaned his right hand on the ground, slowly rising.</p><br><p>"Sure." Dahla emotionlessly replied before reaching her hand forward.</p><br><p>Her eyes shone brightly, energy traveled towards her wrist and golden energy emerged from her fingertips like the rays of the sun.</p><br><p>Immediately, a huge sphere appeared in the center of the chamber shining brightly like an amber star. It did not emit heat or cold, only pure power and a strange calming energy.</p><br><p>Continue your journey on empire</p><br><p>One look at that star was enough to make Silvana's heart beat slower and her anger subside.</p><br><p>Then, Dahla opened her palm, lowering it slightly and looking at Adam, who wasn't paying attention to what was happening around him.</p><br><p>A beam came out of the star, falling on Adam.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>There was a loud crunch as all of Adam's wounds rapidly disappeared. His arm and leg were back to their original state, bones falling into place, blood recovered and torn flesh rejoined.</p><br><p>"What...?" Adam looked at his hand, it was completely healed.</p><br><p>He clenched his hand into a fist a few times and jumped in place, trying to see if there was any damage left, but no, it was all good.</p><br><p>The beam of light along with the star was gone. Dahla bowed and walked out of the chamber, heading for the observation room with Douglas and Silvana.</p><br><p>"You don't have to check. Dahla has fully healed you, she'll do that every time you get too seriously wounded." Damien explained, taking a step forward.</p><br><p>Adam nodded slowly, his eyes growing deeper. He realized that although this fight was Damien's whim, he prepared.</p><br><p>"Dahla, K4-Phantom, so she has enough power to recover almost any of your wounds. Well, as long as all your organs and limbs aren't destroyed, but I won't go that far, I guess..."</p><br><p>Toward the end, Damien's voice grew quieter, filling with a menace to face that no one would want.</p><br><p>A second later, Damien glanced at Adam with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Well, let's get on with it!" Damien said as he bent his torso forward, about to attack.</p><br><p>Adam raised a hand, stopping him.</p><br><p>"Wait... Do you intend to not even use energy against me? How can a fight be interesting if all you use is your physical force?" Adam said in a weak voice.</p><br><p>Damien smirked, casting Adam a curious look.</p><br><p>Then, an idea came to him causing his eyes to go wide for a moment.</p><br><p>"Alright, I see what you're saying. Then, let's do the following."</p><br><p>Damien smirked slyly pointing to his hat.</p><br><p>"If you can knock my hat off me, then you're strong enough to wound me. Do that and I'll start using the energy of the K2-Level." Damien suggested.</p><br><br><p>"Fine, I agree. I hope you don't care about that hat, since I'm going to destroy it!"</p><br><p>Damien smiled contentedly, waving the rod in the air.</p><br><p>"Good, that's the fighting spirit I wanted to see! Come on, you've only shown First Order, there's more to come!"</p>
