            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1343: Aura and the Silver Wing Sign</strong></p><br><p>While Adam was outside the Silver Beacon, the others had the opportunity to watch what was happening from afar, which Norax and the others took advantage of.</p><br><p>“Hahaha, can you see that?” Karso laughed. “That knight is trying to hide it, but Adam managed to anger him!”</p><br><p>Misty frowned slightly, lost in thought. “Tsk. I really want to know what he said. Because of the barrier, we can’t hear anything. That knight, he’s one of the most patient souls I know.”</p><br><p>Narica and Norax exchanged glances as they came to the same conclusion.</p><br><p>“Well…” Norax chuckled. “Even if you’re the most patient person in the world, nothing can save you from the truth. What’s more, Adam is a pretty bold guy. Let’s see how this turns out.”</p><br><p>Narica said nothing, but she was a little worried about Adam. Since Norax’s mill offered a sweeping view of the Silver Beacon, she had witnessed several times how the contenders lost at the very first stage.</p><br><p>They were simply unable to fight against the Knight of the White Spire and hold out long enough.</p><br><p>Naturally, Norax did not doubt that Adam could handle it. He only needed to sense their auras, even in their hidden state, to know who would emerge victorious. It was a privilege of the strong.</p><br><br><p>The knight moved forward as his aura focused on Adam. This was the first step in his test. If a contender could not even resist his aura, there was no point in continuing.</p><br><p>However, instead of seeing struggles on Adam’s face or him hastily summoning his Spirit, Adam just smirked and stepped forward.</p><br><p>‘Agh? What is this boy doing?’ The knight thought, puzzled. He was sure that in a few seconds, his aura would crush Adam. ‘Why did the lady let such an arrogant human like him in here? Although… he won’t be the first to be destroyed by his own pride.’</p><br><p>The knight would have been right in most cases, but as soon as Adam released his aura, all his thoughts and complaints were shattered by harsh reality.</p><br><p>Adam did not try to control his aura. He just gave it complete freedom of action.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A white pillar of flame burst out of Adam, towering over the knight, and now the pressure was on him.</p><br><p>The knight’s pupils narrowed as he felt his armor crack and his legs tremble. Even though he was a giant compared to Adam, his height and size were useless in the face of the superior aura.</p><br><p>“That’s it.” Adam grinned smugly, feeling the energy rush through his body.</p><br><p>It was the first time since rebuilding the Energy Axis that he had released his full aura. It was an indication of his peak power, and even he himself was impressed.</p><br><p>Rattle. Rattle. Rattle.</p><br><p>The knight fell to one knee, and with each of Adam’s steps, the pressure only intensified.</p><br><p>‘No, how can this be… How can a K4-Phantom at his stage have such power?’ The knight muttered inwardly, peering into Adam’s aura.</p><br><p>He could clearly see the white dominant light, among which there was almost no gold left as Adam had absorbed all the power of the Connected Heart, and a faint but familiar purple hue was visible.</p><br><p>The Knight of the White Spire, as an experienced monster who had lived for hundreds of years, understood that this was Adam’s aura and his Operator, but… soon he noticed something else.</p><br><p>For a moment, the white light disappeared as the knight’s gaze moved further into the depths of Adam’s aura, where he saw shreds of darkness trembling like ancient sparks. They had appeared not long ago and had always been hidden from Adam and others, but they had established excellent synergy with Adam.</p><br><p>Then the knight understood what was going on, as did someone else who had been watching their brief battle. It was obvious that the guard needed help to continue his duty.</p><br><p>With a bright glow, the sign of the two was engraved on the knight’s chest, wide open wings like an angel’s, but with sharp, warlike edges.</p><br><p>As soon as the silver wing sign was in the knight’s possession, the situation changed dramatically.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The knight’s aura intensified several times as he rose from the ground, towering over Adam with his former pride and now with a slight arrogance in his gaze, wanting to show Adam that he was wrong.</p><br><p>‘Now, everything will be different. With this power… I will be able to show this insolent young man that he is too young to behave this way.’</p><br><p>However, Adam just smirked, as if he had been expecting this.</p><br><p>“Good, I knew that wasn’t all you were capable of.” He grinned widely.</p><br><p>Then, his grin froze and slowly turned into a cold face full of disappointment.</p><br><p>“But.” Adam stared at the silver wing sign. “That’s not your power, is it? That power belongs to someone else.”</p><br><p>Not wanting to continue their conversation any further, the knight gripped his axe tightly with both hands, raising the great weapon above his head.</p><br><p>“Yes, and so what? I am grateful that I was allowed to use this power. Only in this way can I show you that you are wrong, that your manners are not worthy of this place!”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam looked up. “When you accepted this power, you proved that I was right. I recently fought against someone who used someone else’s power. She was a strong opponent, but as soon as she asked someone for help, my victory was a foregone conclusion.”</p><br><p>The knight couldn’t know that Adam was talking about Bathild, but he could see from his expression that the fight hadn’t made an impression on Adam’s heart.</p><br><p>“That’s all nonsense.” The knight shook his head. “The power I received is nothing compared to what your opponent had.”</p><br><p>Adam lowered his gaze as he stretched out his hand, electric discharges running through his fingers.</p><br><p>“Well, I’m sure your mistress is strong, but is she really stronger than the Befallen Crown?”</p><br><p>As soon as the name of that faction was uttered, the knight swung his axe at Adam, but he was faster, vanishing with an electric blast.</p><br><p>In the next moment, Adam appeared to the right of the knight, the guard’s eyes following him through the slit in his helmet.</p><br><p>“I thought so. I’ll do as you wish, I’ll pass your test.”</p><br><p>The next moment, Adam slashed his sword straight across the knight’s shoulder as a thunderbolt crashed down from the sky, heading straight for the loyal guard of the Silver Beacon.</p>
