            <br><br><p>The brown leather jacket's zipper slid down, completing Silvana's look—something between a hunter and an airplane pilot.</p><br><p>Shaking off her neck-length black hair, Silvana smiled broadly and walked out of the room, meeting Adam's gaze.</p><br><p>He didn't need to go to the Dead Lands, so his clothes were comfortable, but still maintained a working and serious attitude.</p><br><p>Adam was wearing black wide pants with a tight belt, strict shoes, and a loose white shirt with a few buttons and a wide collar that lay in waves across his shoulders and chest.</p><br><p>His hair was styled, not only was it well-coiffed, but he had used nail polish along with salt spray. He had the pleasant scent of a well-chosen perfume and his face looked as perfect as a statue chiseled by a master sculptor.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide at the moment she saw Adam, for some reason today she had a strong reaction as if she was seeing him like this for the first time in her life, although he, as her Operator, always tried to look decent.</p><br><p>"Is something wrong?"</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"You're looking at me like you're seeing me for the first time."</p><br><p>Your next chapter is on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>That should have embarrassed Silvana and it did, but soon her expression changed to confident.</p><br><p>"I'm not allowed to look at my Operator anymore? You're dressing like that for me after all! Hahaha!" Silvana laughed placing her hands at her sides.</p><br><p>Hearing another half compliment half joke, Adam just rolled his eyes, but he didn't deny Silvana's words.</p><br><p>Then, his eyes dipped lower to the tablet in his hands, on the screen were the details of their mission today.</p><br><p>"You are to travel to the far side of the Dead Lands in Obsidian Spatial Caves."</p><br><p>In an instant, Silvana's face grew serious. She was well aware of all the details about her next mission that the military had been asking her about for some time now, but it was always good to hear about her assignment one more time before heading out.</p><br><p>"There will be two other Phantoms with you, Abel and Talna. Abel has good defense abilities and will give you time to fight, Talna will assist, reinforcing you both."</p><br><p>At the next words, Adam's calm voice became colder and harsher:</p><br><p>"Considering that due to the peculiarity of the location, there can be a maximum of three of you, otherwise the risk of the mission will increase many times over, this is the best team I've been able to assemble."</p><br><p>"I see. Well, I'm not going to lose anyway, because..."</p><br><br><p>In a moment, Silvana found herself behind Adam, throwing an arm over his shoulder.</p><br><p>"I've yet to eat the hearty dinner my Operator will carefully prepare, haven't I? Hehehe."</p><br><p>Slight irritation appeared on Adam's face as he threw off her arms and headed for his office.</p><br><p>"Pfffft! You're such a child!"</p><br><br><p>Opening the door, pointing to a chair in front of a multitude of screens, Adam was indignant.</p><br><p>"Am I the Operator or her babysitter? Same thing every time!"</p><br><p>Teasing Adam, Silvana smiled slightly and hopped towards the exit with a full fighting spirit.</p><br><p>A black car was already waiting for her at her house, about to take her to Fort Norton.</p><br><p>Before getting into the car, Silvana turned around, glancing around the large house that they started living in for the sake of comfort in their work since Adam even moved his office with all the devices into it.</p><br><p>'Good thing he's staying here... If for some reason the Operators had to go to the Dead Lands with us, with the Phantoms, it would be a real disaster.'</p><br><p>The woman in the black suit standing next to the car bowed respectfully:</p><br><p>"Ms. Silvana, I don't want to bother you, but we should hurry. The fighter will be departing shortly and two of your mates are already in place."</p><br><p>"Yeah... Sure..." Silvana muttered, getting into the car.</p><br><p>Since yesterday, a strange feeling had settled deep inside, as if something was wrong, but she couldn't figure out what the reason was.</p><br><p>Her mind told her that everything was the same as before, today and yesterday were no different from a week or a month ago.</p><br><p>'But... I still have a bad feeling about this.' Silvana thought tightly clenching her fists.</p><br><br><p>After a while, the car came to a stop, next to the takeoff pad. The fighter was ready to fly, the pilot was in his seat checking all the indicators, and in front of the ramp were two Phantoms waiting for the last member of their squad.</p><br><br><p>Silvana stepped forward confidently, looking intently at her battle comrades on this dangerous mission.</p><br><p>On her right stood a tall man with short black hair and a muscular build. He waved at Silvana with a wide smile, greeting her.</p><br><p>Though he would be their protector, he wasn't wearing armor. The extra weight slowed him down and at best would protect him from a few attacks. Abel preferred to rely on his body, speed, and ability, it was something he could control and that depended only on him. He limited himself to loose leather armor, giving him superior mobility and the feeling that he was protected.</p><br><p>To his left stood a girl of medium height with dark robes covering her lean body. She had shoulder-length crimson hair, with spiky pointy tips looking down.</p><br><p>Her dark green eyes were always filled with slight discontent and irritation and seemed to be bored with every second of her existence.</p><br><p>Like, Abel, she glanced in Silvana's direction but had no intention of greeting her, instead Talna just chewed gum, occasionally blowing big blobs.</p><br><br><p>Silvana approached them with an excited expression.</p><br><p>"Hi. Sorry I'm late, but I think we'll be there on time."</p><br><p>Abel nodded with his arms crossed over his chest.</p><br><p>"Yeah, don't worry about it. The mission isn't the easiest, but we have a good team."</p><br><p>Then, Silvana looked at Talna, expecting some reaction from her. Instead, she noticed that Talna was staring at her bosom with a heavily furrowed brow.</p><br><p>"Damn it. Bitch, what are you eating that you have hills like that!"</p><br><p>Without saying anything more, Talna turned around and walked off into the depths of the fighter.</p><br><br><p>Silvana was in a stupor before lowering her gaze.</p><br><p>'What's wrong with her? What's more... I'm an average size!'</p><br><p>Abel scratched the back of his head awkwardly.</p><br><p>"I think we should go after her and... start the mission."</p>
