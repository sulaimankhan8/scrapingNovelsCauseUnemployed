            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1379: Path of Tragedy</strong></p><br><p>Adam woke up, and the first thing he noticed was his new power.</p><br><p>“Desire Gene? Order of Desire?”</p><br><p>He smiled bitterly with a heavy sigh that caused a slight pain throughout his body.</p><br><p>“Agh, I see… The Grand Stars and the number of conditions fulfilled are not as important as the difficulty of the condition itself, right? Well, the Desire of Beyond, fulfilling that part was more difficult than I had imagined.”</p><br><p>[Order of Desire was created.]</p><br><br><p>Your will and energy, together with your needles, took on a completely new form—all thanks to your desire and victory over the enemy from the past. You relived the tragedy that once befell you and turned it into your strength.]</p><br><p>Even a simple breath caused Adam slight pain, but could he deny himself the opportunity to see what his order was capable of right now?</p><br><p>“A-Alright, if it’s only for a few seconds, there shouldn’t be a problem, right?”</p><br><br><p>A slight tremor left Adam as the energy flowed toward him, starting from his feet.</p><br><p>Immediately, he noticed something unusual.</p><br><p>“Agh? Was it like this before…?”</p><br><p>His energy now consisted of one-third darkness, which intertwined organically with pure, white energy, like two types of flame that were both close and infinitely distant from each other.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam had known for a long time that part of his energy had gained the power of darkness after his stay at the Dark Shore, but it was only a tiny part, no more than 3-5% of his total energy.</p><br><p>Now, it was a full-fledged part of his power, and what’s more, there was another factor that surprised Adam even more.</p><br><p>“This energy, hah, it no longer feels foreign. It seems that this darkness is now completely mine!”</p><br><p>Adam was happy not only because he had become stronger, but also because it meant that he was no longer dependent on the First Star. He didn’t know if the First Star had any influence on him, but it was always good to be confident in his own abilities.</p><br><br><p>When the energy reached Adam’s hand, the needle appeared in his grip, unlike any of his previous ones.</p><br><p>The needle was snow-white with a handle large enough to be used with either one or two hands. The blade was long and thin, and the edges of the blade were black with a sharp tip.</p><br><p>From the baseline over the rigid guard and almost to the very tip, there was a shallow hollow where darkness wanted to go, leaving light to saturate the needle itself and its sharp sides.</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly. He understood that his needle should not look extravagant, in his case, that would be a disadvantage.</p><br><p>What was more important was the effectiveness of his new weapon.</p><br><p>“Let’s see.” Adam looked at the rock behind the platform. “Now I can do this, right?”</p><br><p>In one smooth motion, Adam swung his needle as a dark line hung in the air before him.</p><br><br><p>The line trembled, and at that moment, the rock cracked in the center before collapsing to the ground in two pieces.</p><br><p>“It’s something between the lesser path and the second needle. I wonder what would happen with a simple attack?”</p><br><p>Adam concentrated, directing his energy to his hands and body rather than the needle, but before he could make a normal swing, everything blurred before his eyes.</p><br><br><p>He collapsed to the ground and only opened his eyes a few seconds later with a sharp headache.</p><br><br><p>Adam clutched his head as he rolled on the ground.</p><br><p>“You overdid it. You’re still too weak.” Silvana’s voice rang in his head.</p><br><p>“Tsk, I know that! I just can’t help my curiosity. But… You’re right, I should focus on other things right now.”</p><br><p>Adam closed his eyes as he found himself in the inner space, right in front of the Path Construct.</p><br><p>He felt that significant changes had occurred with the Evolution Tree. Its energy was voluminous and powerful, but it was the Patch Construct that was his path to the next stage.</p><br><p>[Second Grand Star (Star 7#)</p><br><br><p>Connected Heart: 1/1</p><br><p>Desire of Beyond: 1/1]</p><br><p>Adam stared at the light swirling around the Second Grand Star of his future constellation, but so far, it wasn’t enough to complete the whole picture.</p><br><p>“Dark Heart and the Hybrids, they’re next… I don’t know exactly how I’ll do it, but at least it won’t be as foggy as the Desire of Beyond. Hah, that one was a rough road.”</p><br><p>Then, Adam turned as his gaze moved to the top of the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>“Damn it, what happened here?”</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward as he found himself at the crown, next to one of the four rivers.</p><br><p>His gaze immediately went to the white orb hovering above the lake. But, he immediately noticed that neither the lake nor the orb was the main thing in this place.</p><br><p>“Come out. I want to talk to you.”</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The white orb trembled as the Silver Weaver appeared before it. He looked the same as when they last met, except with blue eyes and without his needle.</p><br><p>“You woke up faster than I expected. Are you so eager to continue fighting?”</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver’s gaze swept over Adam, who, even in the inner space, looked worn out and exhausted.</p><br><p>“Well, what can I say? The World Wipe will happen in seven years, even less, whether I want it to or not. All I can do is try to stop it, and for that I have to get stronger as quickly as possible.”</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver nodded.</p><br><p>“Sure. But you must remember that when the time comes, you will be in the big leagues. You will be among monsters like yourself, and if you’re not careful, they will simply devour you to achieve their goals, which will ultimately affect the whole world.”</p><br><p>However, this warning did not scare Adam as he just glanced away.</p><br><p>“What can I say? I’m going to become a monster like them. I’ve decided that I’m going to go all the way, and I’m not going to doubt myself anymore.”</p><br>
