            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1486: Party</strong></p><br><p>Two days after Adam learned the conditions for creating the Third Grand Star, several people headed to their skyscraper.</p><br><p>They knew very well who they were and were even waiting for them, especially Silvana, who looked at the table full of various dishes, snacks, and drinks with a slight smile.</p><br><p>She was a good cook, after all, she had been taught this at the Operator Academy, and it was not unique to women. Louis, who would soon be joining them for dinner with Alexia, had learned this as well.</p><br><p>The table was set with everything from meat and fish, fruits and vegetables, to desserts and drinks. A glass of champagne was prepared for everyone, well… except for one place. Trici would be there, and it was still too early for her to drink strong drinks. Juice or soda would be more suitable for her.</p><br><p>“Good job,” Adam nodded deeply. “I know Mom will definitely bring a cake. Let’s put it in the center of the table. I don’t know about Alexia and Louis, they didn’t say anything, but considering what kind of person Louis is, I doubt they’ll come empty-handed.”</p><br><p>Silvana wiped the sweat from her forehead as she quickly counted the number of seats so that everyone would have one.</p><br><p>“Maybe we should have invited someone else?”</p><br><br><p>“I don’t know. It was a spontaneous idea, you know. Don’t worry, it won’t be the last party we throw. Huh, there’s enough room in this house to invite an army!”</p><br><p>Silvana was about to say something, but at that moment the elevator doors opened. Considering how much their penthouse cost, the skyscraper had an elevator that led directly to their home. It was convenient and efficient, but… it cost a lot of money, a lot.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Louis and Alexia were the first to arrive.</p><br><p>Louis was dressed in an impeccable black suit with a calm blue tie and wide trousers, and… Alexia was wearing a short dress. This shocked Adam and Silvana much more than Louis’s suit.</p><br><p>It was unknown how Louis persuaded her to do this, perhaps he promised her something or, on the contrary, threatened her, but here she was.</p><br><br><p>Alexia walked confidently forward, looking around.</p><br><p>“Damn, where did you get so much money? This place looks more like a floating castle than a house!”</p><br><p>“Hey, it’s not that bad.” Adam smiled. “In fact, of all the options we had to look at, this is far from the biggest, but… it turned out to be one of the most expensive.”</p><br><p>Louis shot Alexia a sharp, knife-like glance.</p><br><p>“If you didn’t lose millions at the casino after every mission, you could easily buy something like this.”</p><br><p>Alexia flinched. She was scared when Louis looked at her like that.</p><br><p>But she quickly recovered and waved her hand carelessly.</p><br><p>“We have a great house and enough money. I don’t see the need for something like that.”</p><br><p>Alexia glanced at Adam and Silvana as she waved her hand.</p><br><p>“Hi, nice to see you and all that.”</p><br><p>Before Silvana could respond, Alexia snatched one appetizer and two shrimp from the table.</p><br><p>“Oh! This is delicious!” Alexia’s eyes widened as she tried the next appetizer. “Louis, you have to try this! No, you have to get some recipes from Silvana!”</p><br><p>Louis shook his head and walked over to them, holding out a bottle of wine enclosed in a black box with a thick glass cap.</p><br><p>“I would apologize for her behavior, but you’re not seeing Alexia for the first time, so…” He turned to see Alexia stuffing grapes into her mouth, taking aim. “You know what kind of person she is.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply. He understood Louis.</p><br><p>Silvana pointed at the bottle of wine.</p><br><p>“Wow, is that for us? It looks impressive. I’m sure that bottle alone is worth a fortune!”</p><br><p>Louis’s lips curved upward.</p><br><p>“Well, that would be an exaggeration, but in a way, you’re right. This bottle of wine is from my wine collection. They are very rare, and currently, none of this series is for sale. But, I would say they are worth between 5 and 7 thousand credits.”</p><br><p>Silvana’s eyes widened. She knew that elite and truly rare alcohol could cost a lot of money, and even 20 thousand was not the limit. Still, holding such an expensive wine in her hands made Silvana curious.</p><br><p>Adam, in turn, shrugged.</p><br><p>“Huh, considering how much I had to pay for this penthouse a few days ago, such amounts seem insignificant. Although I understand that this is something unique.”</p><br><p>Louis nodded. “It is. I hope you enjoy it. Also…”</p><br><br><p>Soon, Louis had a simple soda can in his hand with some character jumping through a hoop and a large cherry sticker on the side.</p><br><p>“I know your family is coming soon, Adam, and you have a younger sister. This simple-looking soda can is something of a collector’s item. It was available for a limited time in limited quantities, and it’s related to some kind of game, something like that.”</p><br><p>He handed the soda can to Adam.</p><br><p>“I think it will be a great substitute for wine for Trici.”</p><br><p>Adam picked up the soda can and grinned. “You’re damn right. Louis, a few more tricks like that and I’ll start to envy Alexia.”</p><br><p>Silvana’s eyebrow twitched.</p><br><p>“Hmm? What does that mean?”</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand. “Come on, I’m just kidding. Everyone knows that man &amp; man won’t work. Well, if we’re talking about a Phantom &amp; Operator pair.”</p><br><p>Louis didn’t answer, he just sighed as his gaze turned to Alexia, who had taken a seat at the center of the table.</p><br><p>“Looks like you’re enjoying yourself?” he asked, resting his elbows on the back of her chair.</p><br><p>Alexia crossed one leg over the other.</p><br><p>“Yeah, the food is delicious, and I’m sure it’ll be fun. Heh, I want to see Adam’s sister. I wonder if she’s like him? After all, they have the same blood running through their veins.”</p><br><p>“She’s only 8, I don’t advise you to ask her inappropriate questions. You don’t want Adam to be angry with you.” Louis warned her.</p><br><br><p>“I know. Don’t worry, I’ll behave myself, I promise. But…”</p><br><p>Her voice lowered as she glanced at Louis.</p><br><p>“Drinks aren’t the only reason we came here today. Adam wants to talk to me about something, right?”</p><br><p>Louis nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“The Third Grand Star. His conditions. You’re interested in that, right?”</p><br><br>
