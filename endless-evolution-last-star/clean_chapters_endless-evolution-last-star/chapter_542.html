            <br><p>The wedding was only a short time away from a successful completion.</p><br><p>The groom was to say his vows, then the bride should do the same. The vows were followed by the rings and at the very end the bride and groom were supposed to end the wedding ceremony with a kiss as a seal of their eternal love and loyalty to each other.</p><br><p>But, unfortunately, or fortunately, this was not destined to happen, not anymore.</p><br><p>A hundred gazes stared at Adam like a ghost who appeared out of nowhere at just the right moment.</p><br><p>The black cape with the massive Balo Family emblem fluttered in the wind, slowly descending to the ground, creating a brief time gap that allowed guests and everyone involved in the wedding to realize what had just happened.</p><br><p>Then, on Osana's face, for the first time in a long, appeared the first emotions.</p><br><p>She smiled weakly and her pink eyes became wet, just a little bit more and a flood of tears was ready to come out. And... they would not be tears of grief, but of happiness at having come in time to be rescued from her eternal imprisonment.</p><br><p>Reinal's eyes went wide when he finally realized that all his suspicions and strange sensations were taking place. His face turned pale and shivers went down his body.</p><br><p>'The Rule of Power... How... How... How could she do that? No, this shouldn't have happened. It can't be!!!' Reinal inwardly screamed, with eyes rapidly filling with blood.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, the full meaning of Adam's words reached Nirosh as well, whose joyful smile slowly faded away, turning into a frightened grimace.</p><br><br><p>High heels flew off to the side as Mariel stepped forward, stomping on the stone floor with her bare feet.</p><br><p>Her face contorted in anger, a wild rage that could not be controlled or contained.</p><br><p>Mariel's eyes narrowed like a demon's, her veins swelled and her long nails dug into the soft skin of her palms, crimson trickles of blood running down her fingers.</p><br><p>Then, her silhouette trembled.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Mariel disappeared, rushing forward like a vengeful shadow bearing only death. The guests, who were mere humans, hadn't even realized anything yet, and... even among the Phantoms, few could follow her movements.</p><br><p>'The Rule of Power?! Fuck no! If I kill this little bastard right here and now, no one will remember what happened here. The fight hasn't started yet! I won't let anyone disrupt the wedding!'</p><br><p>Mariel inwardly roared like a wild beast as she appeared in front of Adam, his blue eyes only shifting slightly, just now noticing her lightning-fast movements.</p><br><p>'I will kill anyone who gets in my way! I will destroy you, worthless creature!'</p><br><p>Mariel assumed a fighting stance like an experienced fighter, in an instant raising her leg that rushed straight for Adam's head. The force and speed of her kick were enough to blow his head at any, even the slightest touch.</p><br><p>Adam's hair tips trembled as his body finally came into motion, but the difference in speed between them was too great as if the weak White Threat Monster was trying to dodge the Plague Reaper's faster attack.</p><br><p>Rosalind who stealthily sneaked into the banquet hall, shuddered in fear. She couldn't have time to help Adam, nor Franz who hadn't expected Mariel to go to such an extreme, after Adam declared about The Rule of Power.</p><br><br><p>Silvana blinked and saw a completely different scene.</p><br><br><p>Out of nowhere, a figure appeared in front of Adam, its aura eerie to everyone present, as if the demon watching from hell finally decided to step out of the shadows and participate.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Mariel's foot slammed into the figure's palm, seeming to do it no damage at all, which in Mariel's worldview was simply impossible.</p><br><p>The recoil from her kick, an explosive pulse capable of destroying a rock, traveled throughout the banquet hall, making the massive walls shake, plates and glasses tremble violently ready to fall from the tables, eight crystal chandeliers swayed from side to side, instilling fear in the guests seated beneath them and even the ninth, largest chandelier began to shake back and forth.</p><br><p>Tablecloths from nearby tables flew away with all the dishes, some guests were thrown from their heavy chairs, and a torrent of wind like the wrath of a storm ripped through the banquet entrance, smashing the gates into the walls.</p><br><p>It was only a recoil, it seemed that the figure that took the impact instead of Adam should explode from such force, but...</p><br><br><p>Gladius ran his right hand through his hair, adjusting it slightly, the powerful wind currents ruining his hair, partially disheveling it.</p><br><p>And, Gladius didn't mind this turn of events.</p><br><p>"Oh, looks like someone got angry. What a pity, now your fake mask fell off. But, don't feel bad."</p><br><p>Gladius mussed his hair, now the tips of his white hair were only slightly above his eyes.</p><br><p>"Your kick was strong enough to give me a new hairstyle!"</p><br><br><p>Gladius's placed a hand on Mariel's shoulder.</p><br><br><p>Mariel blinked once, her brain trying to convey to her mind that none of this was an illusion, that someone unknown had actually succeeded in blocking her attack performed at full force with the clear intent of killing Adam Vinter.</p><br><br><p>Mariel bounced back, staring intently at Gladius. She was trying to figure out who the man in the waiter's suit was.</p><br><p>"Why are you all standing still!?"</p><br><p>Suddenly, came Zarot's furious voice.</p><br><p>"Mariel is doing the right thing! This lowlife sent by the Balo Family doesn't even know what he's doing! All he deserves is a quick death for trying to stop the wedding of the High Nobles!"</p><br><p>Then, Zarot's eyes filled with flames of anger, and his aura released from his body at full power.</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Moments later, all the Phantoms of the Marzo and Rouzet Family present at the wedding released their auras.</p><br><p>Aura pillars of different lights appeared on all sides of the banquet hall. Among the guests were those who had followed Zarot's order, for in fact it was a hidden guard consisting only of powerful Phantoms recruited from the Branch Squads.</p><br><p>Not even a few seconds later, Mariel displayed her powerful, bloodthirsty, and violent aura.</p><br><p>Then, dozens of mighty auras rained down on a single target - Adam Vinter, causing his eyes to fill with pain and his body to shudder. Find adventures on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>He didn't know how much longer he could stand under such an incredible onslaught that was stronger than anything he had ever experienced before.</p><br><p>But... in an instant, he stopped feeling anything.</p><br><p>"Hey, you're nobles, so you all know that The Rule of Power is an ancient law that cannot be broken!"</p><br><p>Gladius uttered with a slight smile on his face as he took a step forward.</p><br><p>"However, you seem to forget the importance of tradition and what this rule is all about."</p><br><p>Then, Gladius's calm face changed completely. His green eyes opened wide, his facial muscles tensed with swollen veins as if ready to explode, and his smile turned into a sinister grin capable of frightening a fearless warrior.</p><br><p>"In that case, I'll show you why The Rule of Power exists."</p><br><p>Gladius's voice thundered through the banquet hall like a threat followed by eternal torture for anyone who heard his voice.</p><br><p>"I'll show you lowlifes what is the TRUE POWER!"</p>
