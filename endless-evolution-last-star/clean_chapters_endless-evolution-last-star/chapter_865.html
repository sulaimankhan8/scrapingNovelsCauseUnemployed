            <br><p>Under the astonished stares of the crowd and his opponent, Adam took a heavy step forward.</p><br><p>As soon as his feet touched the ground, his frame shook.</p><br><p>In one quick surge, Adam crossed a vast distance and found himself before a confused Giselle.</p><br><p>She tried to understand how Adam stopped her ice avalanche so easily and what this ability was, but she had no more time for that.</p><br><p>The joy and anticipation that was on Adam's face a moment ago was gone.</p><br><p>All that remained was the cruelty and coldness infusing his fist, moving straight toward Giselle.</p><br><p>This time, Giselle was a little faster, so she successfully bounced back, causing Adam's fist to smash only into the air.</p><br><br><p>The raging currents of wind rushed towards her, blowing her gray hair.</p><br><p>Realizing that she had to seize the initiative at all costs, Giselle swung her hand, summoning eight ice crystals.</p><br><p>With this ability, she set Diron up for his imminent defeat.</p><br><p>This was going to work against Adam. At least wound him so she could continue her series of attacks.</p><br><p>The crystals rained down on Adam, the area of impact was too large for him to have a chance to dodge.</p><br><p>But, did he need to?</p><br><p>With a slight movement of his hand, Adam lightly pulled at the right edge of his coat, pulling the wide fabric over his body to completely cover himself.</p><br><p>One crystal after another, rained down upon Adam.</p><br><p>Not a single one was able to damage him, not even to leave a scratch.</p><br><p>The crystals shattered against his coat like hardened steel. The sharp tips tore the fabric in some places, it seemed that this was now the weak point in his defense.</p><br><p>In the next second, purple flames erupted at each tear, bringing with them a torrent of energy. No sooner had Adam taken his next breath than no trace of the damage was left.</p><br><p>Chunks of ice rolled off Adam's shoulder, but his calm blue eyes were much colder.</p><br><p>Straightening his back, Adam turned around, looking at the wreckage at his feet - all that was left of Giselle's ability.</p><br><p>"Not bad, not bad at all, but it's not enough."</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, but Giselle determined him.</p><br><p>She wasn't about to give up on the idea of defeating Adam in the same manner as Diron.</p><br><p>With a bright flash, Giselle created three copies of herself, quickly circling Adam on four sides.</p><br><p>"You're finished, Adam Vinter!"</p><br><p>With a fiery cry echoing from the four figures, Giselle along with her copies tore at Adam.</p><br><p>Silvana gasped. She remembered well that after that attack Diron could hardly stand on his feet.</p><br><p>The nobles in the crowds were out of breath. They had mixed feelings about this fight, yet no one would dare to call it a bad fight.</p><br><p>They didn't know whether they wanted the fight to end or continue.</p><br><p>Only the blond-haired man, observer no. 3, did not change in any way, a sly smile lingering on his face.</p><br><p>Four ice flashes were about to pierce Adam, leaving him with deep cuts.</p><br><p>That wasn't part of his plans - neither was a cowardly escape.</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, with a loud crack, the black lines on the lapels of his coat opened.</p><br><p>Two massive amber eyes with vertical pupils cast their influence over the majestic passageways.</p><br><p>A wheeze echoed from Adam, reaching Giselle's ears at the moment when her victory was to come.</p><br><p>"Freeze, ice maiden..."</p><br><p>Ripples came out of the snake's eyes, consuming everything within a ten-meter radius.</p><br><br><p>Three copies shattered into slivers, ice couldn't turn into stone, unlike a human being made of flesh and blood.</p><br><p>A thick layer of stone ran down Giselle's legs, preventing her from moving any further.</p><br><p>Her eyes filled with terror as she channeled energy down to stop the petrification process.</p><br><p>A slight look of surprise was visible on Adam's face. He didn't expect Giselle to be able to react so quickly to an attack that was unexpected even for him.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Looks like she wasn't lying when she said she studied my progress. Although... It's strange. The Crimson Monarch only used petrification down in the temple grounds.'</p><br><br><p>'How does she know about that? And... Does she even know? Is it just the speed of her reaction time? I'm impressed, at least I should be.'</p><br><p>Tilting his torso forward, Adam shifted, finding himself in front of Giselle who could not move, now her legs and the marble were one piece, bound together by sturdy stone shackles.</p><br><p>Giselle's wide-open eyes reflected Adam's fist - tightly clenched, not to hit her, but to blast her head into bloody shards.</p><br><p>The bright flash blinded Adam for a moment, but his hit didn't slow a heartbeat.</p><br><br><p>The first reached its target, but instead of blood, ice crystals flew aside, following the frozen mist.</p><br><p>Then, Adam's gaze met Giselle's.</p><br><p>A dense layer of ice separated them, but it wasn't a wall - Giselle was in the center of a massive and extremely strong crystal.</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam wheezed, she felt how Giselle's aura became weaker, "That's a very strong defense skill."</p><br><p>He threw his head back, peering down at the proud noblewoman from top to bottom.</p><br><p>"You have very versatile abilities, unlike me."</p><br><br><p>Adam brought his hand up to attack, his fist clenched tightly.</p><br><p>"Unfortunately for you, I can hit considerably harder."</p><br><p>The crimson wave ran through Adam's body as purple energy condensed around his wrist.</p><br><p>Space distorted near his fist as if it were around a black hole - a supermassive object heavy enough to just infuse everything around it.</p><br><p>Giselle's pupils dilated, she knew what it was, but for the first few seconds, she couldn't shake off her protective crystal.</p><br><p>She could only hope that she could survive Adam's full power punch, his nexus and gravitational root.</p><br><br><p>In a single pulse, Adam's fist slammed into the surface. The shockwave in the air ring moved away.</p><br><p>Then, the impact swept over Giselle like a tsunami from with no escape.</p><br><p>The crystal, comparable to a mountain in gravity, flew aside like a small stone, suitable only for throwing into a lake.</p><br><p>Flying in a straight line with Giselle trapped inside, the crystal slammed into the wall.</p><br><p>One by one, the pulse traveled through the barrier, unbreakable to the K3-Phantoms.</p><br><p>With a loud crack, the crystal smashed into shards, and Giselle's back ripped apart in bloody splashes.</p>
