            <br><p>Oddly enough, unlike Reinz - who put himself out there and took the last test seriously - there was nothing similar in Adam's gaze.</p><br><p>On the contrary, it looked like he was bored.</p><br><p>"Is something wrong?" Erik asked casually, yet he was curious.</p><br><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Adam stepped away from the wall, slowly heading forward.</p><br><p>"What's the point of this test?" he stared at Erik, "You saw that we've trained to the Outer Energy Control and... yesterday's clash showed that the Infusive Energy Control has also become a passing phase for us."</p><br><p>Erik lifted his chin arrogantly, a sly gleam running across his eyes.</p><br><p>"Well, in that case, just do it and get your reward - both from your Evolution Tree and me."</p><br><p>Standing to the side, Reinz oversaw Adam. For a moment he was about to encourage him, but... something made his eyes go wide.</p><br><p>Swollen veins ran down Adam's arms, traveling straight to his bloodshot eyes. His muscles tensed to the limit like steel ropes, and his eyes went cold.</p><br><p>However, there was no bright star in his right eye, nor did his energy change in any way.</p><br><p>It took Reinz a few seconds to realize what happened.</p><br><p>'Wait... What the hell...?' he gasped in disbelief. 'Adam went into Resonance? A normal Resonance, not the Stellar One?</p><br><p>'But... Why? Unlike normal Resonance, you can use the Stellar Resonance at any time as long as you and your Operator have energy. This... it shouldn't be like this...'</p><br><p>Unlike the shocked Reinz, Erik was more reserved in his emotions.</p><br><p>'Ohohoho... What's gotten into you? Is it just me or is entering Resonance too much for a simple test." Erik smirked.</p><br><p>Instead of answering, Adam stomped on the ground.</p><br><p>Cracks traveled across the surface as he caught a rock surging upward.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>Clutching the rock tightly with all his might, his muscles trembling, Adam poured energy into his weapon. With each passing second, the pressure increased as a result, shattering the stone piece by piece until there was only 1/5 of its original size left - compressed to the limit.</p><br><p>Then, he looked at Erik.</p><br><p>"Fight me. Just like Damien did."</p><br><p>Shock covered Reinz's face, he didn't know it, but he didn't have time to wonder since Adam leaned back and threw an energy-filled rock directly at Erik.</p><br><br><p>Cutting through the wind currents the stone traveled towards Erik, it seemed the speed was fast enough to blow his head off. Any monster equal or weaker than Adam would have suffered the same fate.</p><br><p>Erik smiled, catching the rock with ease like a ball.</p><br><p>"Not bad, not bad at all," he tossed the stone a few times, then his aura wavered once.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Erik threw the stone in Adam's direction.</p><br><p>Even with Resonance activated and a full desire to fight, Adam didn't have time to react. The stone flew to the right of his ear, leaving a light cut as a reminder.</p><br><p>Then, the stone crashed into the wall.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A deafening rumble ran through the arena, carrying with it an active shudder as if a massive bomb had exploded behind a stone slab.</p><br><p>A stream of dust swept over Adam, who covered himself with his hands, looking through the gaps in his fingers at the carelessly standing Erik.</p><br><p>"Adam, I'm not going to fight you. It's not necessary for you or me." Erik shrugged with a slight wave of his hand, "Damien wanted to quench his curiosity and see what you're capable of as a K2-Phantom. I, on the other hand, just want to see if you've mastered the second and third types of Energy Control."</p><br><p>He stretched out his hand, trickles of smoke wafting upward.</p><br><p>"By the way, you passed the first test. If I wasn't your opponent, even K4-Phantom would have gotten a wound, a slight one, but a wound.</p><br><p>"Come on. Show me how you use the Infusive Energy Control and we'll be done with this. I will fulfill your wishes as promised. After all, the only thing I need from you is results."</p><br><p>As if not hearing him, Adam used his abilities one by one. Threads covered his body, rings flashed with crimson energy, purple streams ran down his right arm, and as a final touch a needle appeared.</p><br><p>Reinz took a few steps back. He didn't want to accidentally get hit by an attack that wasn't meant for him.</p><br><p>"Mr. Erik..." Adam hissed, white energy surging from his body, filling his needle with power, "I'm going to fight you - for real."</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam disappeared from his spot. The ground beneath his feet cracked, becoming a crater.</p><br><p>In a flash, Adam found himself in front of Erik, the silver needle trembling wanting to unleash its full power on its target.</p><br><br><p>Erik stepped forward, whizzing by Adam's side like a ghost.</p><br><p>Then, Adam collapsed to the ground, his eyes blank.</p><br><p>"Agh... Young people are always so impatient."</p><br><p>Erik shook his head, a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Somehow you remind me of Kogen, but that guy is a crazy beast, he wouldn't even listen to me and would attack as soon as the idea came to him."</p><br><br><p>He glanced at Adam, staring intently at one point - at his right shoulder where he attacked. He saw Adam's energy condensed there, in a tight white bundle, all to protect him.</p><br><p>"You're adapting too quickly. I'd like to say you're like a monster, but..." Erik looked up, his crimson eyes deepening, "Isn't the ability to adapt the strongest human trait? It's the only thing that still allows us to stay in this world despite..."</p><br><p>Suddenly, Erik stopped talking, he was about to say something he shouldn't have. Not in front of two K3-Phantoms that were like kids to him, both in terms of strength and age.</p><br><p>"Alright." Erik adjusted his collar, "You both passed the test."</p><br><p>Reinz's eyes went wide, joy was evident despite the strange ending.</p><br><p>"Mr. Erik, does that mean I..."</p><br><br><p>Erik nodded deeply heading for the exit.</p><br><p>"You, Reinz Alderran will go to Heaven Island, to the Void Lake as you wanted. Adam Vinter will go straight to the Lower Ring. Hah, he was going to do that a long time ago."</p><br><p>Before disappearing behind a shroud of shadows, his voice came once more.</p><br><p>"Tomorrow night. Be ready. Both of you."</p>
