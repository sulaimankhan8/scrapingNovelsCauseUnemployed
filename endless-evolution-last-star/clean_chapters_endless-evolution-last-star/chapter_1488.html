            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1488: Two Guests (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>The Third Grand Star and its conditions were a serious topic, there was no doubt about that, but that didn’t stop the party from being as successful as possible.</p><br><p>Adam and Louis ended their conversation by agreeing to work together and, if possible, fulfill one of their conditions on a joint mission.</p><br><p>He suggested doing the same thing Adam and Fromund had done, but then Adam fulfilled one of the conditions by accident, and he needed this whole mission to get back on track after the dramatic news about the World Wipe.</p><br><p>Now, they needed to find out if it was possible to fulfill their conditions in one place. Perhaps the mission department had a suitable job for them, or perhaps they would fail and have to act separately as usual.</p><br><p>Sure, Louis knew what Alexia’s conditions were. Silvana was in the same situation. However, he couldn’t deny that the Blood of God sounded much more serious than the Ancient Frost, although he didn’t know which of the two was actually more difficult to obtain.</p><br><p>Now, Leona was talking to Silvana about something in the kitchen while they drank wine. Gary, Trici, Louis, and Alexia were playing a board game, 2 vs. 2. Alexia didn’t understand it, but Louis was letting Trici win more often than she lost.</p><br><p>As always, Alexia blamed her failure on everything else, unaware that a double agent was sitting right next to her.</p><br><p>“Damn it! I always have bad luck!” Alexia exclaimed as she got up from the table. “That’s it! My patience is gone, I need some fresh air!”</p><br><p>Adam, who was sitting off to the side, noticed her glance. Louis saw what was happening as she nodded slightly and turned to Trici and Gary.</p><br><p>“Sorry, Alexia just doesn’t like to lose. I know a game for three, but it’s every man for himself. Are you ready?”</p><br><p>“Of course!” Trici exclaimed happily. She believed that her winning streak would continue.</p><br><p>Gary, who understood what Louis was doing, just laughed.</p><br><p>“Hahaha, Trici, I see you’re full of energy. Sure, Louis, let’s keep playing.”</p><br><p>Adam smiled, put his glass on the table, and headed for the balcony.</p><br><p>He discussed many things with Louis, but he couldn’t make a plan without talking to Alexia first. She, like Fromund, had a lot in common with Adam, but each person was unique.</p><br><br><p>Deafening footsteps sounded behind her as Alexia turned around.</p><br><p>Cold gusts of wind blew past her, ruffling her blue hair. The spacious balcony offered an unobstructed view of the First Ring and the other skyscrapers surrounding it.</p><br><p>For those who preferred urban aesthetics to any other, this was perhaps the best view Citadel had to offer.</p><br><p>“Well, well, looks like someone else got unlucky with the conditions, huh?”</p><br><p>“Did Louis tell you everything?” Adam smirked, stopping to her right.</p><br><p>He leaned against the glass edge, unable to deny how impressive the view was. The streets and lights below merged into a single picture, like countless stars in the night sky.</p><br><p>Sure, there were real stars in the sky as well, but… the brightest of them had long since left its spot, all for the sake of destroying the world time and time again.</p><br><br><p>“Of course. Do you think I didn’t notice you talking? By the way, your sister is quite cheerful. Her interest in the Dead Lands is impressive.”</p><br><p>“Hah, she’s still too young to understand that it’s not a fun place at all.”</p><br><p>Alexia raised an eyebrow with a hint of mockery in her gaze.</p><br><p>“Says you. I’m sure there’s nothing more fun for you than fighting to the last drop of blood against some crazy monster!”</p><br><p>“Gha! You’re the last person who should be saying that to anyone else!”</p><br><p>Alexia shook her head as her gaze became more serious.</p><br><p>“Blood of God, seriously?” She frowned. “What the hell is this?”</p><br><p>In response, Adam shrugged.</p><br><p>“If I knew, I would answer. What about you? Ancient Frost? Maybe it doesn’t sound as impressive as my condition, but it doesn’t look like anything simple. Do you have any ideas?”</p><br><p>“Yeah. Louis and I discussed it. He thinks I can find the Ancient Frost in some deep region, in an icy/frosty area. These are our assumptions, we need advice from someone more experienced.”</p><br><br><p>Like several other things, he had already discussed this with Louis. Only when he, Silvana, Alexia, and Louis talk with—!</p><br><br><p>With a powerful gust of wind, a shadow fell on Adam and Alexia. They were caught off guard, not understanding what had just happened.</p><br><p>When they looked up, their eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br><p>On the glass edge, a man with green eyes and thick black hair crouched. There was a slight smirk on his face, and peeking out from behind his shoulder were two green eyes just like his, belonging to a girl with long brown hair and a haughty gaze. She knew that being behind him, she could afford to look however she wanted, no matter where they were.</p><br><p>“Damien…?” Adam’s voice trembled.</p><br><p>Alexia’s jaw practically dropped to the floor. She was speechless. She usually acted carefree, but an appearance like this could easily surprise even her.</p><br><p>“Hi!” Damien waved his hand. “Beth got Silvana’s message.</p><br><p>She wanted to set up a meeting in the next few days, but when I found out you were throwing a party at your new penthouse, our plans changed.”</p><br><p>Without wasting any time, Damien looked around and whistled.</p><br><p>“Damn, Beth, look at this place! We’re visiting some rich guy!”</p><br><p>Beth was unimpressed by Damien’s acting as she stared at Adam.</p><br><p>“Hey, you. Do you have any soda here?”</p><br><br><br><p>“Good. Then maybe we didn’t come here for nothing.”</p><br><br><p>Damien jumped off the edge with Beth still hanging on his back. He reached out his hand to Adam.</p><br><p>“Okay, enough with the jokes. Long time no see, huh?”</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head as he smiled and shook his hand.</p><br><p>“This, yes, it’s been a long time and…”</p><br><p>Before Adam could process this, Damien waved his hand, throwing Adam off the top of the skyscraper, leaving him in free fall.</p><br><br><p>This was definitely not how he had imagined tonight would go.</p>
