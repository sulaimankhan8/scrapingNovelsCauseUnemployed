            <br><p>Adam expected the Mighty Commander to be just another boring opponent with nothing but strength in his arsenal, yet it was clear to him that he was wrong.</p><br><p>The Mighty Commander turned out to be not only fast and uniquely utilized the environment and terrain to his advantage, but also a surprisingly fun monster.</p><br><p>If the common human heard that someone thought monsters were fun or joyful, they would consider it utter nonsense.</p><br><p>Monsters were terrifying, creepy creatures that inspired terror and brought nothing but pain and rivers of blood. This was mostly true, but... every strong monster was first and foremost a fighter.</p><br><p>Who could forbid a fighter from feeling excitement, from truly enjoying the fight? Only a fool who never reached such heights himself.</p><br><p>Obviously, Adam completely shared the Mighty Commander's feelings. The last time he felt this way was quite some time ago.</p><br><p>'Fromund... When I fought against you, I was full of fighting spirit, but it's one thing to fight against a human and quite another against a monster!'</p><br><p>Strangely enough, in Adam's mind, the closest comparison was not the Plague Reaper, but the Essence Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>'Plague Reaper was strong, intimidatingly strong, and just as serious. But... you and the Thunder Demon, you two fucking hilarious bastards that are trying to eat me!'</p><br><br><p>With a full desire to win, Adam swung his arms, unleashing six silver threads at the Mighty Commander.</p><br><p>It was far more than Adam could freely control, but against an opponent as big as the Mighty Commander, he didn't need high precision.</p><br><p>The Mighty Commander licked his teeth before activating his bracelets again, pulling himself to the nearest stone peak.</p><br><p>Their battlefield shifted from the air to the ground, but there were just as many stone peaks here. The Mighty Commander raced over them like a nimble beast, maintaining his strength.</p><br><p>Yet, now Adam had a way to defend himself and it wasn't his threads.</p><br><p>'Agh... I can't see anything but amber flashes, if I blink he'll appear from above, left or behind again, but... he's not a silent killer, he's a wild beast, his every leap is loud and distinct.'</p><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana watching the fight in silence saw only darkness in front of her.</p><br><p>'What...? What's going on?'</p><br><p>After a moment, it took Silvana a moment to realize what Adam had done - he closed his eyes leaning forward. Silvana quickly switched to NEP's camera, following his risky movements.</p><br><br><p>Adam put his palms to the ground, listening intently to his enemy's every movement, every jerk, every splinter falling away from the stone peak due to the firm grip of the paws.</p><br><p>'You used the earth attribute to turn this uncomfortable cave into a battlefield built for you, to your pure advantage, but... to some extent, I too can affect the earth.'</p><br><p>It seemed that Adam was putting himself at mortal risk with his eyes closed, but he was simply taking advantage of the fact that sound traveled through solid rock much faster than through the air.</p><br><p>If there was silence for a moment - then the Mighty Commander was already in front of him.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a powerful tremor traveled through his gauntlets, heading downward to cause a mighty earthquake.</p><br><br><p>The Mighty Commander's eye went wide, watching as the ground broke into wide furrows, water flowing heavily, yet the round platform and pathways remained unharmed, Adam was unable to even scratch them.</p><br><p>Realizing that the trembling was not preventing him from leaping, the Mighty Commander grinned broadly and gathered all his strength in one impulse, launching himself straight at Adam.</p><br><p>'Adam! He's attacking!' Silvana exclaimed in panic, believing that Adam was unaware of this.</p><br><p>However, given the Mighty Commander's speed, and the minimal delays in image transmission, her voice reached Adam's ears when the Mighty Commander had almost completed his attack.</p><br><p>Yet, instead of bursts of blood, the Mighty Commander's large red eye reflected only running glints, along thin, barely noticeable silver threads.</p><br><p>Then, Adam raised his head and opened his eyes wide.</p><br><p>"What, you don't like it? You changed the battlefield, so I decided to create an arena inside your arena, enjoy!"</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam swung his arms in different directions, stretching the threads to the limit.</p><br><p>Like dozens of blades, six threads ran across the Mighty Commander's paw, leaving numerous deep cuts.</p><br><p>Splash. Splash. Splash.</p><br><p>Splashes of blood rushed outward, scattering in all directions.</p><br><br><p>The Mighty Commander roared in pain, but neither he nor Adam were going to stop there.</p><br><p>"Come on! This is just the beginning!"</p><br><br><br><p>There was no telling how much time had passed since then, not even Silvana had an answer to that question. All she saw for a long time was the countless clashes between Adam and the Mighty Commander as the once colorless water became crimson and even two powerful waterfalls were unable to clear the lake in time.</p><br><p>"Gha... Gha... Gha...."</p><br><p>Adam and the Mighty Commander were breathing heavily as they stood on the borders of the round platform. Most of the stone peaks were broken and two strands were torn apart by the monster's powerful jaws.</p><br><p>"Hey... How about one last attack? Just a little more, and we'll fall without strength... I don't know about you, but I don't need a second round."</p><br><p>The Mighty Commander didn't reply, but from his downcast gaze, it was clear that he was also at his limit.</p><br><p>He didn't receive any mortal wounds as much as Adam, but the number of cuts on his large body was countless. The reserve of his strength was not endless, and neither was his blood.</p><br><p>"Alright. I'll start first, then!" Adam exclaimed before rushing forward.</p><br><p>There was nothing but a tired but excited smile on his face, flames burning brightly in his eyes.</p><br><p>"Grhaaaa..." The Mighty Commander's corners of his mouth went up as he shook his head and turned into an amber flash one last time.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, they collided in the center of the platform, the Mighty Commander's paws headed towards Adam, wanting to grab and break him.</p><br><p>Hitting the ground with the threads, Adam jumped up, the extra momentum giving him the speed to get behind the Mighty Commander's grip.</p><br><p>"Hah, you're slow after all, big guy."</p><br><br><p>Adam bounced off the Mighty Commander's right paw, then he bounced off the monster's broad shoulder.</p><br><p>Under the light of the bright crystals, a lone gleam traveled down the tightly taut threads around the Mighty Commander's neck.</p><br><br><p>In a gust of wind, Adam tensed his fingers and threw his arms forward, clenching his fists tightly using all the strength available to him.</p><br><p>Enjoy exclusive chapters from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>A large red eye twitched as a surge of blood rushed in front of it.</p><br><br><p>The huge head flew off the shoulders, releasing a fountain of dark blood spurting upward from the decapitated body.</p>
