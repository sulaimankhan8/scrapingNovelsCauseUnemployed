            <br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A rumble echoed throughout the castle, dust falling from the ceiling onto the first floor where the battle for the future of the serpents was taking place.</p><br><p>Kreyna glanced up - Arnoth's fight had begun, and it couldn't help but make her worried.</p><br><p>"Hmm... Looks like your pathetic friends have finally made it to the throne room," Kreyna uttered, entering the dark circle area. "What a shame, I was hoping the goliaths would stop them."</p><br><p>Vorx and Risha glanced over at each other. They didn't know what Kreyna was talking about, but they could feel three powerful auras coming from above.</p><br><br><p>At Kreyna's next step, her blades flashed as she was ready to attack, the purple flames growing along the dark ring.</p><br><p>Wasting no time, Risha and Vorx got into fighting stances.</p><br><p>But, something made them stop at the last moment.</p><br><p>One of the three powerful auras above was greatly weakened, to a very low limit. It wasn't death, but a critical wound - one more hit, and that aura could fade away forever.</p><br><p>For a few seconds, they all wondered.</p><br><p>Whose aura was this?</p><br><p>Then, a chill ran down their backs as two powerful fields appeared on their left and right sides, trying to nail each of them to the ground.</p><br><p>Vorx and Risha realized that Heret was not capable of something like that. Kreyna was in a similar situation. She only saw Arnoth fight at full strength, in all seriousness, a few times.</p><br><p>Kreyna would never forget what his aura felt like at the peak of his strength.</p><br><p>"Hah, looks like one of your fighters has already lost," Kreyna smirked, getting into a fighting stance. "A few more minutes and the other one will fall as well. The same fate awaits you!"</p><br><p>At the same moment, a purple star appeared at the far end of the dark circle, it soared above the border.</p><br><p>The exact same star, a copy of the one, appeared behind Risha.</p><br><p>Then, Kreyna's frame shuddered, and her blades turned into two shining crescents.</p><br><p>Before Risha realized it, Kreyna was already in front of her - a demon obscured by shadows, only her smirk still visible.</p><br><p>At the last moment, without her knowledge, her energy was channeled at her feet. Several fragments on her mirrored boots glittered.</p><br><br><p>The purple line cut through Risha's mirage as Kreyna swept onward, leaving only a handful of glass behind her.</p><br><p>Her speed surge stopped when she reached the purple star. Then, the star faded, in two places at once.</p><br><p>Vorx's eyes ran over Risha to reassure her that she was fine, and then he stared at Kreyna.</p><br><p>'I see. Very quickly, as if Heret was attacking at full force with his ability. However, before she can dash, she has to create a star - choose a spot. It takes her one to two seconds. Good, that's enough time to do something.'</p><br><p>Despite Kreyna's attempt to kill Risha, Vorx was in no hurry to help her - he didn't even move since he knew Kreyna wouldn't attack him. His instincts remained calm.</p><br><p>In secret from enemy and ally, Vorx slowly built up energy in his chest, it traveled down his arms, returning to his core.</p><br><p>Kreyna snorted, looking at Risha over her shoulder.</p><br><p>"Tsk." She grimaced. "What was that? Did someone help you? You looked scared, like a child, but you still managed to dodge. You're weird..."</p><br><br><p>Radiant Mirage's voice boomed in Risha's head.</p><br><p>"What? Shut up!" Risha exclaimed, swinging her axe.</p><br><p>'Pffft! I won't. I just saved your life, you fool! You should thank me and listen to me carefully.'</p><br><br><p>Radiant Mirage shrugged. 'I don't know what, but your friend is planning something. He needs time, not much, but we must not let Kreyna interfere with him. So... All you need to do is attack her like a wild beast. I'll help you dodge her surges, a few times for sure.'</p><br><p>Without saying anything, Risha nodded deeply.</p><br><p>Kreyna noticed the dangerous glint in her eyes.</p><br><p>Something had changed, but she didn't know what the reason was. In any case, she had only one task in front of her - to kill them both.</p><br><p>"I don't know what you're up to bitch." Kreyna spat out a clot of blood. "But, you better think twice before you look at me like that!"</p><br><p>Her aura intensified as a purple star appeared behind Risha.</p><br><p>This time, the distance between them was much smaller. Kreyna already turned into a shadow, but her trick lost its efficiency.</p><br><p>Now, Risha knew what to do.</p><br><br><br><p>Thanks to her new ability from Radiant Mirage, she stepped aside, dodging the blades that wanted to cleave her flesh.</p><br><p>Kreyna gritted her teeth, and once again, she destroyed only Risha's mirage.</p><br><p>"Stupid bitch! You think that's all I'm capable of?!" Kreyna exclaimed furiously as three stars appeared around Risha at once.</p><br><p>Her eyes went wide, but she was ready to stand until the end.</p><br><br><p>At the first surge, Kreyna's blades slammed into Risha's axe. But, just as Kreyna reached the second star, Risha didn't have time to react.</p><br><p>"Argh!" she cried out in pain, the blades leaving a wide X-shaped cut on her back.</p><br><p>Then, Kreyna made a third surge, aiming straight for Risha's neck, who had not yet had time to recover from her last attack.</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Risha's frame shuddered as her boots shattered into hundreds of fragments, whizzing in front of her. A glittering veil covered her silhouette, allowing her to disappear from Kreyna's path.</p><br><br><p>A shocked Kreyna turned her head to the side to see Risha, who stood a few meters away. Her legs were trembling, and her aura had weakened considerably.</p><br><p>It took a lot of energy for her, or rather Radiant Mirage, to avoid a critical wound or even death.</p><br><p>Kreyna wanted to continue her attack - one move and Risha would be finished.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, someone's hand fell on her shoulder.</p><br><p>She turned around to see Vorx in front of her, and his cold eyes.</p><br><p>Before she realized it, Vorx hugged her tightly like a lover, but there was no tenderness, only a promise to give her everything.</p><br><p>Kreyna's eyes lowered - the bright flash grew more powerful in Vorx's chest with each passing second, like a bomb reaching its peak.</p><br><p>Then, all the energy burst out in a deafening blast.</p>
