            <br><p>During the current Eclipse, while hundreds of monsters and a dozen Phantoms were dying, the Dormant Lord only made three attacks.
</p><br><p>His power was enough for such a modest amount of participation in the battle to have an effect greater than all the other monsters combined.
</p><br><p>Even the fire ray of the Conqueror Flame Raider was not as destructive as the starfall. True, the starfall happened with the archer’s involvement, but the catalyst for it was the Dormant Lord’s spear.
</p><br><p>Now, the Dormant Lord once again used his pure energy to alter the battlefield to get rid of an insolent and arrogant creature.
</p><br><p>Experience new stories on NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><br><p>With a fast-paced screech, the snow-white spear swept along the flaming ray, splitting it into several separate lines.
</p><br><p>The fire passed next to the Dormant Ray like a pair of shots, powerful but not accurate enough, it knocked them off the right trajectory.
</p><br><p>But... his spear did nothing to stop it, the flames weren’t dense enough to stop or shake it.
</p><br><br><p>Clots of blood rushed out, crimson droplets flew in front of the Conqueror Flame Raider’s shocked eyes, then a bright flash covered him all over.
</p><br><p>Rumble. Rumble. Rumble.
</p><br><p>Streams of white energy spread out to the sides, following the shockwave from the devastating explosion.
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord, a creature without wings or the ability to fly, watched as the white flames, his energy, consumed the Conqueror Flame Raider, the one who always proudly soared but was now nailed to the ground like a true weakling.
</p><br><p>"Grooh!" "Groooh!" "Groooh!"
</p><br><p>The other Flame Raiders along with the flying monsters who received reinforcement from their leader shouted furiously in the Dormant Lord’s direction. While he didn’t fall to the ground yet, they rushed towards him, quickly surrounding him like vultures.
</p><br><p>A whisper echoed among the Phantoms:
</p><br><p>"Hey, maybe we should help him?"
</p><br><p>"Yeah, I think so too, we should get rid of the flying monsters first, then we can deal with the others."
</p><br><p>The other Phantom nodded, pointing his steel bow upwards.
</p><br><p>"I see your point. I’m sure we’ll have plenty of trouble with that bastard later, but right now the priority is the birds."
</p><br><p>However, he failed to make the shot, as well as many other Phantoms sharing his position.
</p><br><p>"Agh...? What’s going on...?"
</p><br><p>Their hands were shaking, not allowing them to aim, the cold was running down their backs and with this situation were 90% of the Phantoms.
</p><br><p>For some reason, most of the Phantoms were trembling with fear, all of them were looking at the catalyst but didn’t realize it.
</p><br><p>Only the strongest Phantoms like Katrin, Viron, Gnash, and the other squad commanders were in control, the trembling didn’t engulf them but they felt the terror deep inside.
</p><br><p>Katrin lifted her head up, watching the Dormant Lord, dozens of monsters hovered around him, preparing a simultaneous attack. The Flame Raiders opened their beaks, eager to incinerate the hated enemy.
</p><br><p>Yet, the Dormant Lord remained calm. He didn’t even look at anyone other than the Conqueror Flame Raider, unlike the Flame Eagle, he was strong enough to act arrogantly.
</p><br><p>Then, before the flames could reach him, the Dormant Lord released his aura, in full force without holding back.
</p><br><p>A dense white aura rushed upwards in a powerful stream, transforming into his Spirit, the true form of his aura.
</p><br><p>A pure white nine-pointed star soared above him like a king in the celestial sky. Its radiant light didn’t make one close their eyes, on the contrary, the star wanted inferior beings to look at it, realizing their weakness and insignificance before true power.
</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.
</p><br><p>One by one, the Phantoms fell to their knees, the same fate befell the monsters, their heads and paws nailed to the ground, unable to stand firmly on the surface.
</p><br><p>"You..." Katrin muttered in a trembling voice as she watched the Flame Raiders falling from the sky, "You’re a monster..."
</p><br><p>For a brief moment, the silhouette of the Plague Reaper was reflected in her mind. It was the last monster who made her feel so weak and helpless.
</p><br><p>However, she was one of the few Phantoms that could continue to stand upright despite the overpowering pressure of the Dormant Lord’s aura working at full strength.
</p><br><p>Among the monsters, the situation was the same.
</p><br><p>The Grim Warro smiled nervously while the water shell of the Silent Droao trembled slightly, but unlike the others, they felt dignified.
</p><br><p>Just like the one who started all of this...
</p><br><br><p>The Conqueror Flame Raider let out a furious roar, first, the Dormant Lord humiliated him and now using his aura to defeat his followers.
</p><br><p>The flame raiders and the other flying monsters didn’t die, but they lost consciousness since they were much closer to the nine-pointed star than the others.
</p><br><br><p>Flapping his wide wings a few times, the Conqueror Flame Raider soared above the ground, yet all he could achieve was a few meters.
</p><br><p>On his chest was a wide-open wound from the explosion of the plasma spear, blood flowed down in a thick stream while an intimidating aura pressed from above, but the Conqueror Flame Raider had to keep fighting.
</p><br><p>Raising his head, the Conqueror Flame Raider’s eyes narrowed as he gathered all his energy, directing a stream of flames towards his beak.
</p><br><p>His pupils reflected the Dormant Lord, who in the next moment simply disappeared.
</p><br><br><p>The eagle’s pupils dilated, not realizing where the Dormant Lord had gone, just a second ago he was high in the sky, the pressure from the aura gone as well.
</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the Conqueror Flame Raider felt a jolt on his back, then something with a powerful grip grabbed onto his right wing.
</p><br><p>"GRRRRRRROOOOOOO!!!"
</p><br><p>The Conqueror Flame Raider realized that the Dormant Lord dropped onto his back, he began to flap his wings rapidly, flames spurted from the long feathers in an attempt to defend himself.
</p><br><p>But... it was too late.
</p><br><br><p>In one swift motion, the Dormant Lord ripped the Conqueror Flame Raider’s right wing off, ignoring the eagle’s screams drowned in agony.
</p><br><p>Blood flowed frantically, while bones and tendons slowly tore away from muscle and hide.
</p><br><br><p>The Dormant Lord threw the wing that was bigger than him several times aside, bringing the Conqueror Flame Raider back to the ground.
</p><br><p>Now that the flying monster lost its ability to live in the sky, all that was left was to take its real life.</p>
