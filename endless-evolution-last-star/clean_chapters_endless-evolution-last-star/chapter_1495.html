            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1495: Azure Island (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Adam remembered his first visit to Heaven Island well. At that time, he didn’t know that besides the Lower Ring located under the Citadel, there was something else above the Citadel.</p><br><p>That was enough to shock Adam to the core, but when he met Queen Elisa, it turned his world upside down.</p><br><p>Now, he understood that there was nothing unusual about Queen Elisa’s existence, on the contrary, humanity needed to experience the Word Wipe time and time again. If it weren’t for Queen Elisa, neither Adam, Silvana, nor millions of other people would ever have been born.</p><br><p>Sure, most people died of old age anyway during the quiet periods, since 250 years passed between each World Wipe. Still, many Phantoms and their Operators managed to become strong enough during that time to continue. Queen Elisa’s barrier protected them every time.</p><br><p>Last time, Adam arrived at Heaven Island with Douglas, and they used a hidden platform in the very center of the First Ring. It was intended for both the Phantoms and the Gamma Division personnel.</p><br><p>But… If it had been Damien or someone equal in power to him, such methods would not have been necessary.</p><br><p>He, like some other Phantoms, could simply fly here using his energy.</p><br><p>Technically, Adam and Alexia could also do this now. Climbing to such a height would be difficult for them, but with time, they would manage. They just needed a little practice.</p><br><p>The great tree and Queen Elisa herself, imprisoned inside a bright crystal, were hidden from view, even from those who set foot on Heaven Island. The monolithic tower surrounded her like the walls of a royal chamber.</p><br><p>The only way to reach Queen Elisa was to climb the white stone staircase and open the tower gates.</p><br><p>“This…” Adam gulped, looking at the pale blue light emanating from the open top of the tower. “Even considering everything that has happened recently, I still can’t believe that something like this exists.”</p><br><p>Even Alexia remained silent, unable to help but admire the view that opened up before them.</p><br><p>They hovered above the clouds thanks to Damien’s streams of wind and energy, but all their eyes were fixed on the island in the distance.</p><br><p>For a moment, something confused Adam as he looked up.</p><br><p>Amidst the night sky, he could barely make out the outline of another object. It looked like an island, but it was significantly smaller than Heaven Island and more reminiscent of a giant ship or air base in size.</p><br><p>“Hey, what the hell is that?” Adam frowned, pointing upward.</p><br><p>He was prepared to accept that Heaven Island was hovering above the Citadel, after all, he was here for the second time, but… another island above Queen Elisa?</p><br><p>This was not what Adam was prepared for. Moreover, he did not understand why he had not noticed this island last time.</p><br><p>“What the hell!?” Alexia’s eyes widened. She rubbed her eyes, unable to believe it, but she could clearly see the outlines.</p><br><p>Silvana and Louis exchanged glances. They were the Operators, but they didn’t know anything about this either.</p><br><p>“Oh, right, you’re seeing it for the first time,” Damien chuckled. “Well, it’s not our target, and you can’t go there, but there’s no harm in me telling you about it, right?”</p><br><p>Beth nodded weakly. “Go on. To some extent, they’ve already interacted with this place.”</p><br><p>Damien pointed to the object above.</p><br><p>“That’s the Azure Island. Unlike the Heaven Island, it’s completely artificial. It stays in the air thanks to its engines, its design, and energy. The ground and everything else there is just for decoration.”</p><br><p>Silvana touched her lips, confused.</p><br><p>“Azure Island? Wait… Is it somehow connected to the Azure Lotus?”</p><br><p>Damien nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“Yep. The Azure Island belongs to the Azure Lotus, or more precisely, to their leader, Frida. As far as I know, none of you has met her personally, but you all know who she is. What’s more…”</p><br><p>He narrowed his eyes, pointing first at Adam, then at Alexia.</p><br><p>“She saved Adam’s life twice and Alexia’s four times.” He glared at Alexia. “Do you know what a bitch Frida is? If you keep getting into life-threatening situations, at some point, Frida will decide to just pretend she forgot to save you.”</p><br><p>Louis flinched. He understood that this meant Alexia would die the next time something like this happened. He knew that Frida had saved Alexia several times, but he wasn’t aware that it had happened here.</p><br><p>“Pfffft!” Alexia snorted. “I didn’t ask her for help! I’m strong enough to deal with my enemies on my own!”</p><br><p>“Khm,” Louis coughed. “The last two times, her spear saved you at the last moment.”</p><br><p>“That’s not true!” She waved her fists.</p><br><br><p>“So, basically, while the Phantoms are fighting at the Dead Lands, they are always under Frida’s protection, although most of them don’t even suspect it. At the Azure Island, other Phantoms follow Frida’s path, they’re kind of like her students, but obviously Frida is the main one.”</p><br><p>Silvana raised her hand. Her gaze showed that she had questions.</p><br><p>“But… Even Frida has limitations, right?”</p><br><p>Damien waved his hand. “Of course. If you’re deep underground or in the far reaches of the Tarnished Lands and Dark Shore, you can forget about help. Frida’s influence and her people only extend to the surface of the Dead Lands.”</p><br><p>Adam chuckled. For some reason, he found it funny.</p><br><p>“When you become strong enough, you lose your guarantee of safety.”</p><br><p>“Hah, something like that, but you have to understand that Frida can’t help in all situations. Her spears are too powerful.”</p><br><p>Damien was about to say something else when a bright blue light came out of the top.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a great azure spear, the size of an island, soared into the night sky. It trembled and, at tremendous speed, like a falling star, headed in the direction of the Tarnished Lands.</p><br><p>A smirk spread across Damien’s face.</p><br><p>“Here we go. Unlike me, she always works. Hah, poor soul.”</p>
