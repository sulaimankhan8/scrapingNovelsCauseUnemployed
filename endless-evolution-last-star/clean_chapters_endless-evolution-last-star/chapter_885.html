            <br><p>The nobles glanced around after hearing Adam's wish.</p><br><p>A mansion in the middle of the first wing? Moreover, Adam wanted to be in neutral territory, government territory.</p><br><p>"Wait...? Is that even possible?"</p><br><p>"Yeah... It sounds kind of weird."</p><br><p>One of the nobles frowned heavily, pondering Adam's wish.</p><br><p>"Almost any house can be bought for 140 million, but... to buy something, you need it to be for sale, right?"</p><br><p>To Adam, their whispers meant nothing. This was his opportunity to solve the housing problem once and for all.</p><br><p>He had discussed buying a house at the Second Ring with Leona some time ago, but why a house at the Second Ring when you could get a mansion at the first wing?</p><br><p>'Well...' Adam gulped, 'There's not much use for my family with this mansion. It's just the best I could come up with! I wasn't even given a chance to think about it!'</p><br><p>Then, he internally shook his head, 'Fine, at worst I'll just sell this house.'</p><br><p>However, the real reason why Adam made such a wish was another.</p><br><p>He wanted to see what the observer would say.</p><br><p>"And?" Adam tilted his head, looking intently at the girl, "Will the hotel management be able to do it? Or will it be handled by the great families?"</p><br><p>"Hah, you think you're asking for something that's out of our hands?" observer no. 1 nonchalantly waved her hand, "Don't worry. If you win, you'll get your mansion."</p><br><p>After that, she turned to Reinz.</p><br><br><p>"Hmm..." he glanced up, "I have 120 million, don't I? Well, given my opponent's desire, I guess it's simple."</p><br><p>Reinz pointed at Adam, his eyes calm as ancient ice, "If I win, I want Adam Vinter to get a house on the Alderran Family grounds."</p><br><p>The eyes of the spectators went wide.</p><br><p>It was obvious to everyone that for Reinz, the wish before the fight was no more than a formality.</p><br><p>If he wanted, he could easily get 120 million for personal spending. For the first great family, it wasn't a very large sum.</p><br><p>However, he decided to use his wish in such a way, and... Adam didn't like it at all.</p><br><p>'Bastard...' Adam's eyebrow twitched, his fists clenched tightly, 'He figured out that I didn't want to be influenced by the nobles. I chose neutral territory for that. Hah, you need to win first!'</p><br><p>The fighters had expressed their desires, which meant that the observer had only one task left - accepting the bets.</p><br><br><p>The girl snapped when a countdown showed up in the center of the arena - 5:00.</p><br><p>"Dear guests. You have exactly five minutes to place your desired territories. After that, the fighters will equip their Nexuses, and the battle will begin immediately."</p><br><p>Not wanting to get hit, the girl stepped outside the arena and touched the floor.</p><br><p>At the same moment, up whipped a transparent silver barrier, reaching up to the golden bridges.</p><br><p>It was unknown how strong the barrier was, but Adam was sure that neither he nor Reinz had the strength to even scratch it.</p><br><p>'She said about Nexuses, right?' Adam thought as he looked at his hands, 'My Nexus is always with me, but... what about him?'</p><br><p>Observer no, 1's appearance wasn't like the others, yet she didn't bring a black case with her. That could only mean one thing.</p><br><p>'The Nexus is already with him? But...' Adam squinted intently studying Reinz, 'I don't see anything. There are no weapons and no jewelry. How strange...'</p><br><p>Second, after the second went by, the elders of the four great families staked out territories. Not too many, but it wasn't just one house on the edge, entire streets were in progress.</p><br><p>The other noble families were staking money at the same time. Not that it was a way for them to make money, but betting always increased the interest in watching the battle. Moreover, it was great to feel like a winner.</p><br><br><p>A distinct ringing resounded throughout the North Arch, the betting time had come to an end.</p><br><p>"Adam VInter and Reinz Alderran, prepare to fight!" observer no. 1 exclaimed, raising her arm high, "The fight will begin at the wave of my hand!"</p><br><p>With ease, Adam took a short step forward, energy actively flowing through his body. He didn't use any abilities beforehand, as his opponent hadn't even shown his Nexus yet.</p><br><p>Reinz nodded as his hand disappeared under his shirt, to one deep pocket.</p><br><p>He pulled out a long cylinder, something resembling an eyeglass case, but too long and narrow, only slightly wider than human fingers.</p><br><br><p>The lid flew aside as Reinz swung his hand sharply.</p><br><p>Ten small shadows flew out of the cylinder as Reinz thrust his hands forward, his fingers spread apart.</p><br><p>As the cylinder disappeared, Reinz's hands held ten rings of rough black metal, as if they had been created not by a blacksmith but by a thunderstorm that had melted the volcanic rock.</p><br><p>Silvana, watching the fight from afar, narrowed her eyes. She looked at Reinz and Adam, because... at first glance they had the same weapons.</p><br><p>'His Nexus, it's just as I thought. Adam never had an opponent like this before.' Silvana pondered, 'Sure, Adam has two rings, and Reinz has ten, one on each finger, but... it's still the same type of weapon.'</p><br><p>Most of the nobles knew of Reinz's Nexus, after all, he was a famous figure.</p><br><p>"You have rings too...?" Adam stammered as the corners of his lips went up in a bitter smile, "That's interesting! Show me what you can do!"</p><br><p>For the first time in all the time at the Twilight Palace, a fire lit up in Adam's eyes. He felt a familiar sense of enjoyment in the fight.</p><br><p>But, Reinz did not share his enthusiasm.</p><br><p>"Adam, let me clear something up for you."</p><br><br><p>Reinz turned his palms toward him, a gleam running down the ten identical rings.</p><br><p>"I only armed myself with my Nexus because the rules demand it. I will defeat you at the very beginning of the fight, for... there is a difference in evolution between us."</p><br><p>At the same moment, observer no. 1, waved her hand.</p><br><br><p>A vibrant light dazzled the arena as Reinz opened his right eye - the four-pointed star shone brightly while streams of energy filled his body with great power.</p><br><p>He wanted to step forward, his muscles trembling and his veins swelling, but... the next scene made him stop.</p><br><p>Adam's right eye... as soon as he blinked, a four-pointed star appeared in it too.</p>
