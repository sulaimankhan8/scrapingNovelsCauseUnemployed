            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1497: Winding Fragments (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Every Phantom who first arrived at Heaven Island also learned about the existence of the Gamma Division and Touched Humans.</p><br><p>The only exception to this rule was the offspring of the Twelve Branches, who, due to their status, had the opportunity to learn about the secrets of the Citadel earlier than others, if they were ready for it, of course.</p><br><p>Even for Adam, the news about the World Wipe came as a shock. However, this was not surprising. He progressed quickly and learned about it at a fairly early age. If he had progressed more slowly, he would have been a little older.</p><br><p>However, given the situation, this would have meant that Adam might not have been strong enough to survive the World Wipe if he had evolved slowly.</p><br><p>“Mr. Damien,” the man sighed heavily. “You brought two K4-Phantoms and their Operators to Heaven Island. I’m not saying you don’t have the right to do so, but you could have at least notified us about it.”</p><br><p>He looked at Beth, who was looking away and pretending she knew nothing. To some extent, that was true. She was just going with the flow of the turbulent river that was Damien himself.</p><br><p>“You could have just asked your Operator.”</p><br><p>In response, Damien shrugged.</p><br><p>“You say that as if Queen Elisa has visiting hours. You should know better than anyone that she is ready to help at any time.”</p><br><p>“Agh.” The man sighed again. “That’s true, but I still believe it’s better not to bother her for nothing.”</p><br><p>“Oh, don’t worry about it. We came here because these two behind me need the Queen’s help. They are going to become stronger, much stronger. Look, you’ve probably seen their faces somewhere.”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Damien was right. The Gamma Division controlled the Citadel, but they weren’t very interested in the news and successes of ordinary Phantoms. Other parts of the government took care of that.</p><br><p>Still, over the past two years, Adam and Alexia had done a great job. They didn’t seek popularity, but their desire to fight and win did the job for them.</p><br><p>“Adam and Alexia?” The man narrowed his eyes. “I see… It’s nice to see that even in the last years before the World Wipe, talent is emerging in the Citadel. The more young warriors, the better, for all of us.”</p><br><br><p>Damien patted the man on the shoulder in a friendly manner, but the man was experienced enough to see the coldness deep in Damien’s eyes. Damien was not going to waste any more time talking.</p><br><p>“Good, now open the gate. Unlike Queen Elisa, I haven’t turned to stone yet, and I have work to do. I have to finish with these two and get back to business.”</p><br><p>The man gulped and stepped aside.</p><br><p>As the gatekeeper, he could refuse even the noble family head if he deemed it necessary, but not Damien.</p><br><br><p>Damien waved his hand. “Good, everyone, follow me!”</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With a crash, the gate opened, and Adam and Silvana exchanged glances as they followed the others.</p><br><p>As soon as they crossed the threshold, the gates closed behind them as they found themselves once again standing before Queen Elisa.</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, as now that she had abilities and energy, she could fully appreciate how majestic the queen’s appearance was.</p><br><p>“Everything is the same as before, right?” Adam muttered, looking at the great tree in front of him.</p><br><p>The tree was devoid of life and energy, resembling a statue of iron and metal that served only one purpose — to be Queen Elisa’s chamber and throne.</p><br><p>At the very center of the tree was a crystal, unmatched in size and energy. None of the Midnight or Twilight crystals Adam had seen before was even a tiny fraction of the queen’s crystal.</p><br><p>And, as before, Queen Elisa was inside the crystal. Her eyes were still closed, her arms spread out to the sides, and her legs bent toward her stomach with her knees fused together, long since becoming one.</p><br><p>Even her jade skin resembled more the stone layer of an enchanting sculpture than the soft skin of a maiden.</p><br><p>Only her long blond hair, reaching below her waist, remained the same as that of a human, rather than a living statue or weapon.</p><br><p>“I’ve seen her in this state hundreds of times, but still…” Damien bit his lip. “We need to do something about this, it can’t go on forever.”</p><br><p>Alexia and Louis exchanged glances. Like the others, they were impressed.</p><br><p>Only Beth seemed to feel no emotion as she looked at Queen Elisa, although it was difficult to read anything in her gaze.</p><br><p>“Damien, since we’ve come here, they should do it and not waste any time.”</p><br><br><p>Alexia tilted her head in confusion.</p><br><p>“Hmm? What exactly should we do?”</p><br><p>Beth moved forward as they approached the platform. If they took a few more steps, they would fall under the influence of Queen Elisa’s energy. Adam and Alexia knew very well what would happen in that case.</p><br><p>“The method I told you about. It’s called the Winding Fragments. With their help, you will be able to understand where your conditions are. As you already understand, it doesn’t matter what it’s called or even who came up with it. Any condition can be fulfilled, the important thing is to find the path to it.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded. He understood what Beth was talking about.</p><br><p>“So, what exactly should we do? Focus on our goals and—!”</p><br><p>Suddenly, something pushed him in the back, faster than he could react.</p><br><p>Adam fell forward, and the last thing he saw was Alexia’s wide-open eyes in front of him. The same thing happened to her as happened to him.</p><br><p>Before Queen Elisa’s energy engulfed them, Adam thought of only one thing:</p><br><p>‘Damien, I promise, the time will come when I will take revenge on you for all your stupid tricks! Tsk!’</p><br><p>Soon, his anger turned to nothing as he fell into a deep sleep.</p><br><br><p>It is unknown how much time had passed since Damien threw them into Queen Elisa’s aura, at least for them, but soon Adam opened his eyes.</p><br><br><p>To his surprise, he found himself in the middle of darkness, but there was no Evolution Tree or Lone Blaze here.</p><br><p>However, there was Alexia, who was just as puzzled as he was, and a multitude of bright stars in the distance, resembling paths to other lands, or rather, wandering fragments.</p><br><p>A slight cold came from one of the stars, which, for some reason, immediately caught both of their attention.</p>
