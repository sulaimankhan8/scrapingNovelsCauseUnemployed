            <h4>Chapter 1126: Flaming Countdown (Part 2)</h4><br><p>Somewhere beyond the darkness, Adam fought like a flaming demon wielding his threads and rods to turn monsters into charred pieces of flesh.
</p><br><p>Silvana and Lone Blaze watched this together from the inner space. Silvana could have been here at any moment, but now she had come here to talk to Lone Blaze.
</p><br><p>"I thought you would return to your wings, allow Adam to protect himself with some kind of fire shield, or even come up with a flaming bomb for a destructive explosion. You know, something like that." Silvana shrugged carelessly.
</p><br><p>Before Adam shook Lone Blaze’s ability, she was worried that he might have problems — first because of the artifact, then because of the number of monsters, but there was no longer any doubt in her eyes.
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze smiled bitterly.
</p><br><p>"Everything you listed would be very useful to him. I thought about each option many times, but in the end, I realized that it would only hurt his fighting style."
</p><br><p>"Yeah, if you can do everything at once, then you can’t do anything. There is no such thing as a universal fighter because there will always be a master in one field who will destroy any universal fighter."
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze glanced at Silvana.
</p><br><p>"Is there anything you’d like to talk about?"
</p><br><p>"Actually?" Silvana raised an eyebrow. "No. At the moment, we do not influence Adam or the situation. Well, I have a few tricks up my sleeve, but Adam won’t need to use them. These monsters are too weak."
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze nodded deeply, raising her gaze to see Adam’s rods begin to redden.
</p><br><p>"Everything except the shadow on that tower, right?"
</p><br><p>Silvana’s lips turned up at the corners.
</p><br><p>"Exactly. Most likely it’s one of the Elders. There should be a maximum of two in this territory, but the mission department often makes mistakes with data at this level. There are too few opportunities to explore the site of the future battle."
</p><br><br><p>The information Adam received was speculative. Most often, it was 70-80% accurate. The reason was that the observation was conducted from a distance or from data provided by Phantoms who had missions nearby.
</p><br><p>If a Phantom was sent to the territory, it achieved its goal and completed the mission. Even if the initial data was incorrect, it was not corrected because the mission was closed.
</p><br><p>Slash. Slash. Slash.
</p><br><p>Time after time, Adam fought his way through the monsters, feeling not only the growing heat and fear of the monsters but also the adrenaline rushing through his body.
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze’s ability gave him everything he loved so much—speed, strength, and threads.
</p><br><p>If he attacked a monster even once, a metal thread would pierce it, becoming a needle that Adam could connect to at any moment.
</p><br><p>The figure watching the battlefield from above saw only Adam attack, and then he turned into a flash of flame and ended up on the other side of the square.
</p><br><p>Monsters of this level were not stupid. They stopped attacking Adam in packs, trying to expose him to attack by flanking him or attacking him one at a time.
</p><br><br><p>"Come on! Show me what you’ve got!" Adam exclaimed, waving his rods crosswise.
</p><br><p>A fiery cross was carved into the monster’s chest, ending its life.
</p><br><p>The knights were among the last to decide to confront Adam. They hoped that the weaker monsters would wear Adam down with their numbers, but that was a big mistake.
</p><br><p>Adam’s rods were now red hot, distorting the air around them with their intense heat. His grin was wide and he was full of strength.
</p><br><p>"Stop standing around! Show me what you’re capable of, you cowardly bastards!"
</p><br><p>Two knights stepped forward, gripping their maces tightly, but the rest flinched. Their legs simply wouldn’t move, paralyzed by fear.
</p><br><p>It was a disaster for them and for all the monsters.
</p><br><br><p>Before the knights could figure out what was happening in their ranks, Adam’s rod pierced the knight’s chest as he released the handle.
</p><br><p>He had an idea of how to use his ability to its fullest.
</p><br><p>Adam grabbed the knight by the wrist and threw the heavy monster at the others like a puppet. The other knights didn’t react in time to dodge while Adam was already taking action.
</p><br><p>If he had simply killed this knight, he would have had to move on to the others, but he no longer had that problem.
</p><br><p>The spark thread lit up as his left rod trembled.
</p><br><p>"Don’t you dare run away! I’m coming!"
</p><br><p>The fiery path was laid as Adam found himself among a pile of knights in an instant. The first one was blown up by the force of the blow. The right rod, along with a piece of flesh, ended up on top before Adam grabbed the hilt, regaining his weapon.
</p><br><p>Then, a painful but not very long death began for the knights.
</p><br><p>All they could see were bursts of flame and Adam’s grin, which was not about to diminish.
</p><br><br><p>Adam’s frame appeared in front of the knight.
</p><br><p>"You’re the last one. What was the point of running away if the outcome was the same anyway?"
</p><br><br><p>The hot rod swept through the knight’s neck, severing its head with such force that it flew high up straight towards one of the towers.
</p><br><p>Adam raised his head, meeting the gaze of the mysterious observer.
</p><br><p>Of course, he had noticed it long ago and determined where the last monster was.
</p><br><p>The figure deftly caught the knight’s head, only to throw it sharply to the side. The helmet was not just hot, its metal was melting, all because of Adam’s rods.
</p><br><p>Realizing that there were no more monsters left, the figure tried to escape by jumping off the tower.
</p><br><p>As soon as its feet touched the ground, a tremor ran across the surface.
</p><br><br><p>One of the rods broke through the tower. While the rod was still in the air, a line of fire appeared between it and the square as the two spark threads were connected.
</p><br><p>Then, Adam appeared next to his second rod, looking down at the figure trying to escape.
</p><br><p>"Hah! I should have thought of this earlier! This is fucking convenient!"
</p><br><p>The monster hadn’t gotten far enough away when Adam made his next throw.
</p><br><p>The next moment, Adam appeared before the monsters as its two green daggers blocked his strike.
</p><br><p>"Here you are!" Adam exclaimed as hot steam emanated from his nearly red body.</p>
