            <br><p>The competition presented in any active society affects each of its members. Sure, there were exceptions, as some people managed to escape from the eternal circle of competition, but in reality, it was an illusion.
</p><br><p>People who were no longer affected by competition probably already achieved their goals in the past and now just did what they liked, because competition was everywhere, but in some places it was hidden and invisible, while in others it was extremely obvious like in sports contests.
</p><br><p>But... nowhere the competition had such a distinct form as in business and, most importantly, in the power struggle.
</p><br><p>Obviously, the higher the level and stakes the tougher became the competition and the methods of achieving the desirable.
</p><br><p>The Twelve Branches and the higher nobles were the perfect example.
</p><br><p>Adam lifted his chin, looking at the smirking Franz.
</p><br><p>"And, what is your plan? You said it would be impossible to accomplish all of this without me, but why?"
</p><br><p>Franz’s smirk slowly disappeared, replaced by a calm expression on his face.
</p><br><p>He folded his arms into his long sleeves and said:
</p><br><p>"Because although I am Light Noble, male, and a member of the main branch of my family, my capabilities are not limitless. Also, I realize that you must have reasons to help me, so I thought I’d remind you to think not only of your safety but also of your family." Franz said quietly, giving a glimpse of some of his intentions.
</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly as he turned around.
</p><br><p>A lot of eyes were still pointed in their direction, he knew he didn’t want to draw more attention to their conversation, especially when the wedding was only a couple of days away.
</p><br><p>Silvana understood Adam and looked sternly at Franz.
</p><br><p>"I think we’d better continue this conversation after the banquet, in a more appropriate place."
</p><br><p>Franz nodded as he turned around and headed towards the other guests.
</p><br><p>"Sure, go out the staff exit, I’ll be waiting for you." Read exclusive content at empire
</p><br><p>Then, like a shadow, after a few steps, Franz disappeared into the crowd.
</p><br><p>Adam slowly turned to Silvana with a slight frown on his face.
</p><br><p>"What do you think? I find it all too strange. It started with the wedding, but because of his appearance, I’m getting deeper into the nobles’ affairs." Adam clenched his fists tightly, clearly unhappy with the current situation.
</p><br><p>Silvana nodded, with a sharp look.
</p><br><p>"I don’t like what’s going on either, but I have to admit that he’s right about something. We have no guarantee that any of the Rouzet or Marzo Families won’t want to harm your family even if their heads are against it. Franz is the first to directly offer protection, not to you, but to your family."
</p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily, shrugged, and headed towards Lona and Max who were waiting for them at the same spot all this time.
</p><br><p>"I realize now that I’m lucky the nobles contacted me so late. I’m sure ordinary people want to reach the level of nobles, but right now I want to get as far away from that as possible. Fuck, I already miss the monsters, at least their goals and desires are clear and not hidden by selfish motives."
</p><br><p>Silvana said nothing, she just silently followed Adam, realizing the gravity of the situation.
</p><br><p>’Franz Balo... I must admit I didn’t expect you to be so smart.’
</p><br><p>Silvana pondered, slowly stepping forward.
</p><br><p>’I don’t know what exactly you want or why you have a problem with Rouzet and the Marzo Family, but you sure knew how to make Adam lose his temper. What’s more, he somehow found out about the wedding and the fact that Osana chose Adam as her protector, that’s a bit alarming...’
</p><br><br><p>Adam and Silvana turned back to Lona and Max.
</p><br><p>"How’d it go?" Max asked in a neutral voice, having some speculation about what might have happened between them.
</p><br><p>"Hard to say, I honestly don’t want to discuss it since I don’t fully understand what’s going on myself." Adam waved his hand.
</p><br><p>Max nodded, then he put his arm around Lona and raised his wine glass high up.
</p><br><p>"In that case, let’s just enjoy the banquet with the four of us, hopefully, no one else will bother us."
</p><br><p>"Yep!" Lona exclaimed vigorously, cheering Max on.
</p><br><p>Silvana nodded with a slight smile on her face.
</p><br><p>"I agree, we came here to rest, so let’s enjoy this evening."
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes ran over them as a satisfied smile appeared on his face. He didn’t say anything, but like the others, raised his glass of wine.
</p><br><br><p>Taking his last sip, Franz set the half-empty wine glass aside, looking intently at Adam, Silvana, Lona, and Max.
</p><br><p>"Agh, mediocre wine for a mediocre banquet." Franz muttered before heading towards the exit, walking past the other guests like a ghost.
</p><br><p>Before disappearing down the dark aisle, not wanting to stay at the banquet any longer, Franz glanced at Adam over his shoulder.
</p><br><p>"Well, I didn’t come here for the food or drinks, but for the opportunity and..." Franz’s eyes grew deeper, "I got my chance."
</p><br><br><p>Franz walked on, a dark silhouette that was a little shorter than him was waiting by the wall.
</p><br><p>"How’d it go? I saw that Mr. Adam was angry in the moment." The silhouette asked, showing obvious respect for Franz.
</p><br><p>Franz’s corners of his lips curved up in a sly smile.
</p><br><p>"Not bad, there were some difficulties, but it was under control. That Adam would be angry was obvious, but it just shows that he values his family as much as I do... well, part of it..." Franz said in a low voice, sinking into the darkness.
</p><br><p>The silhouette nodded slightly, stepped away from the wall, and followed its master.
</p><br><p>Only Franz’s bright amethyst eyes remained in the darkness, shining like stars eager to achieve their goals.
</p><br><p>"I’m lucky Adam comes from the slums, otherwise I wouldn’t have a trump card like Yellow Shark, but... there’s no point in blessing or cursing luck if not even an attempt was made."
</p><br><p>The silhouette walking behind him nodded and adjusted its glasses, a gleam running down the glass revealing two blue eyes.
</p><br><p>"You are absolutely right. If you do nothing there will be no mistakes, no accomplishments, nothing. However, it’s always a risk."
</p><br><p>Franz shrugged nonchalantly as he closed his eyes.
</p><br><p>"Sure, now all that’s left is to convince him to do the right thing... That won’t be easy."</p>
