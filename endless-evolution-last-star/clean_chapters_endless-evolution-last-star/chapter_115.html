            <br><p>The phantoms of the Left Noth Squad stared at the frozen monsters with wide eyes. They felt like they had entered some magical world, or a museum, for the monsters still looked like alive, even though... they had already been dead for a few seconds.</p><br><p>"Argh!" Alexia fell to her knees, while a stream of blood flowed from her mouth. She used every ability she had, including her Nexus.</p><br><p>Considering Alexia's physical strength, it wasn't critical for her. She could still fight after a short break if she needed to. However, she would definitely not be able to use her Nexus for the next few hours, one Order at most, that was her limit.</p><br><p>"I made it through. Good... I killed the 6th Rank. Damn, too bad it wasn't someone from the Top 5, then... it would have been a whole other level, things would have been different." Alexia muttered with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>She glanced around the entire battlefield, looking at the Phantoms and monsters.</p><br><p>In fact, Frost Beast had done them a great favor by summoning most of the monsters here. In that case, the monsters gathered in one place, allowing Alexia to kill them with Absolute Zero.</p><br><p>Thus, those Phantoms that were destined to die or receive wounds were able to avoid this unfortunate path.</p><br><p>Sometimes, under certain circumstances, even the enemy's actions could be a salvation. Well... or was it stupidity mixed with the desperation of one particular enemy?</p><br><p>"Hah, there's a reason she became our leader. I never doubted her." Owen smirked, leaning on his shield. There was a bloody cut above his right eye, pouring blood over part of his face, but overall, he was fine. So were the others.</p><br><p>"Tsk. I was just starting to warm up. It's over, isn't it?" Ester muttered, looking around.</p><br><p>Fred lifted his collar, hiding part of his face, and touched Ester's shoulder.</p><br><p>"Ouch!!!" Ester shrieked as a bright pain traveled through her body.</p><br><p>"You idiot. A few more minutes and you'd have gotten so many wounds you wouldn't be able to move on your own." Fred coldly said.</p><br><p>Ester smiled bitterly, dropping to one knee.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you're right, but... we don't have anything else to worry about." Ester glanced at the horizon.</p><br><p>The moon, hidden by a dark sphere, was already approaching the horizon line. The Eclipse wasn't over yet, there was still a little less than an hour until the moon would completely disappear. However, they had definitely defeated all the monsters in their area.</p><br><p>"By the way... Alexia handled the Frost Beast, but what about him...?" Ester muttered while directing her gaze to the north.</p><br><p>Streams of steam were coming from a young man with black hair and blue eyes. Blood covered his body, and the silver needle slowly spread out into many threads.</p><br><p>Two massive corpses of the Prime Azure Wolves lay at Adam's feet, torn and cut apart. Adam used every opportunity he had to deal damage to the Prime Azure Wolves, so he didn't aim to win with one precise attack.</p><br><p>In the end, Prime Azure Wolves looked like they were caught in a meat grinder before they died. Harvesters would have to do some serious work to extract some materials from them.</p><br><p>'Adam, you've done well. You've already surpassed yourself and by the looks of it, your task as Left Norh Squad is complete. You can rest like the rest of us.' Silvana said with a slight joy in her voice that she could not hide.</p><br><p>Adam didn't immediately reply, because... something was wrong.</p><br><p>"Is it already over...? But, I'm not done yet..." Adam muttered, glancing at his body.</p><br><p>Even though he had already defeated Azure Prime Wolves, he had yet to come out of Resonance. His veins were swollen, and his eyes were filled with blood. His instincts and all of his senses were at their peak, and it seemed to be even higher than when he had fought the Prime Azure Wolves.</p><br><p>"I... I want more..." Adam whispered, like a child who had lost his favorite toy, suddenly and without the possibility of a replacement. </p><br><p>The Phantoms were discussing what had happened with satisfied faces. They hadn't a moment to rest and talk in the last two hours.</p><br><p>"Damn, Alexia is simply amazing with her power. Did you see what she did to Frost Beast? It's insane!" The young man uttered with a wave of his hands.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, having a strong leader is important. After all, during Eclipse, the most important thing isn't strategy or tactics, but pure power! I wonder how the other squads are doing? After all, it looks like we're already done! Hahaha!"</p><br><p>"Hey... What is this? What's going on over there?" Someone said, pointing to the east, where the Right North Squad was supposed to be, also defending the north gate of the Bastion, only on the other side.</p><br><br><p>The blue flash, traveled from one point to another, killing several Phantoms each time. The Right North Squad was far away, so they shouldn't have seen it, but... there was a solid reason why the Left North Squad Phantoms could see it in detail.</p><br><p>The Right North Squad Phantoms were running towards them! With frightened faces!</p><br><p>Moreover, along with the Right North Squad, two more K0-Squads were also moving towards them, because the mysterious monster was chasing them!</p><br><br><p>One of the Phantoms screamed in terror, then... a blue flash tore him apart, with bones and chunks of flesh flying out. Then, the same fate befell another Phantom and another.</p><br><p>Alexia's eyes went wide as something happened that no one could have expected. Against the Right North Squad came a monster so strong that they failed their mission. Moreover, they couldn't even escape because the monster was chasing them.</p><br><p>Soon, Alexia and the other Phantoms of the Left North Squad were able to see who was behind the blue flash.</p><br><p>It was an anthropomorphic creature, a little over two meters tall. The monster's body was covered with light armor of dark cold metal, with many large tiles and massive plates not connected to each other - it gave special mobility with good protection.</p><br><p>In the monster's hands were paired ice blades exuding cold vapor and covered in a thick layer of human blood. Hundreds of tiny blue crystals on the monster's head created the effect of real hair, while the monster's azure eyes constantly rotated, looking for a new victim.</p><br><p>The monster's face, up to eye level, was hidden by a metal mask with various patterns and runes, like a seal concealing a ghastly essence.</p><br><p>It was a North Keeper, a Crown Type Monster, and one who held the 4th Rank among the strongest Purple Threat Level monsters!</p><br><p>Alexia's eyes shone brightly as an excited smile appeared on her face. She rose from the ground, clenching her fists tightly - ready for the next battle.</p><br><p>"4th Rank... This is what it's all about. I may be tired, but I can still fight! I have to!" Alexia muttered, taking a step forward.</p><br><br><p>Just as she lifted her foot, something swept to her left, knocking her down, but not as if she was the target, but as if she was in the way and someone decided to toss her aside.</p><br><p>Before she fell, Alexia looked to her left as her eyes went wide from Adam, who with an eager face, rushed forward, with the sole purpose - reach the North Keeper faster.</p><br><p>Alexia noticed Adam's swollen veins and bloodshot eyes, making her feel resentment inside.</p><br><p>'He entered Resonance... but... I want that too! I want to fight!!!'</p>
