            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1144: Dark Crown</strong></p><br><p>The shockwave’s gusts of wind blew Lyrod’s short white hair. He shielded himself with his hand from the flying debris, while the last flashes shot their rays directly at Adam.</p><br><p>Lyrod watched closely what was happening around him. Something troubled him, he didn’t see Adam run away, but he also didn’t feel that Adam created a protective barrier in an attempt to defend himself from Lyrod’s attack.</p><br><p>At the same time, Lyrod felt an unusual aura emanating from Adam, something very similar to his own after he awoke from the dark dream.</p><br><br><p>Lyrod had never felt anything like it, but the situation was too chaotic for him to understand what was happening.</p><br><br><p>Beams of light struck Adam one after another, and splashes of blood flew in all directions, showing that Lyrod had succeeded and had managed to seriously injure Adam or even kill him!</p><br><p>Ready for any outcome, Lyrod dispelled all the flashes and concentrated the energy around him. A ring of water appeared around him at his feet, ready to protect him in any situation. The stored energy turned into a long blade that he gripped tightly before assuming a fighting stance.</p><br><p>He was not going to make any mistakes. As soon as the smoke cleared and he understood Adam’s condition, he would immediately take action. It was unknown what was happening at the epicenter now.</p><br><p>The next gust of wind partially revealed Adam, showing his mutilated body. He had lost his right eye, his left arm, part of his shoulder, and there were several holes in his legs. Countless cuts and lacerations covered his back and chest, and large chunks of flesh were missing from his sides.</p><br><br><p>His breathing was ragged, heavy, and painful. Blood covered his body, and it was clear that he was struggling to even stand.</p><br><br><p>‘Something’s wrong…’ Lyrod thought as a chill ran down his spine.</p><br><p>Then, his gaze dropped to see a black crown clutched in Adam’s only hand.</p><br><p>[Crown of the Fallen Prince</p><br><p>Status? Status was not as important as the desires of the one who possessed this crown, which came from the desire to fight, take risks, and win like a gladiator in the colosseum. But this crown also requires spectacle, a bloody spectacle that puts both participants in an equal battle at equal risk.</p><br><p>The prince fell because of his thirst for blood, not only that of his enemies but also his own, to make it the foundation of his power.</p><br><p>Of all Adam’s abilities, this was the first to be directly influenced by the energy of the First Star, dark and ancient. Moreover, he was already a K4-Phantom, he had the resources and capabilities to control more complex abilities.</p><br><p>Neither Lyrod nor even Silvana knew what the essence of the Crown of the Fallen Prince was. However, for Adam, it was no mystery, and as he understood, his grin gradually grew wider.</p><br><p>“HAHAHAHAHAHA!” Adam’s laughter echoed through the gorge, seeming to reach the very top of the crypt.</p><br><p>Lyrod frowned, taking a step back. He didn’t like Adam’s reaction at all, because he understood that it wasn’t the laughter of despair, no, it was laughter of anticipation.</p><br><br><p>Instead of placing the crown on his head, Adam placed it on his arm, as the dark crown rested on his shoulder.</p><br><p>“Alright, Lyrod. It’s time for a real battle between two warriors who have earned the attention of the First Star.”</p><br><p>Before Lyrod could react, the dark crown trembled, sending out red pulses.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the red field covered the area around Lyrod and Adam, spreading far beyond the underground gorge.</p><br><p>‘What? What is this?’ Lyrod frowned, waiting for changes. ‘Tsk. He’s so badly wounded. No matter what this artifact is capable of, I can survive one powerful attack, then I’ll finish him off. Moreover, time is still on my side.’</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With the space trembling, two black swords appeared above Adam and Lyrod, simple in appearance but with an ancient aura.</p><br><p>In the blink of an eye, red threads of energy came out of Adam, heading towards his sword to fill this mysterious object with crimson light.</p><br><p>Lyrod’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br><p>With each thread that emerged from Adam’s body, his wounds became smaller and smaller. Not only the cuts and lacerations, no, his arm and eye returned as well.</p><br><p>In just a few seconds, Adam looked as he had before the fight began. All his wounds were healed, and Silvana didn’t have to do anything.</p><br><p>Then, Adam looked up at his sword, which was almost filled.</p><br><p>“80% right away? Hah, I should be more careful for a while, shouldn’t I?” Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>Lyrod became alert as streams of water gathered around him.</p><br><p>‘80%? What is he talking about? What will happen when his sword is completely filled? What about my sword? Considering his words… Most likely, I should avoid filling my sword to 100%, and it healed all his wounds in exchange for crimson light…’</p><br><p>A brief analysis allowed Lyrod to understand part of Adam’s new ability. Sure, Lyrod realized that this wasn’t everything, but it was the information he had. He had to use what he knew.</p><br><p>‘I see… So all I have to do is hurt him a little more and his sword will fill up to 100%. Good, I thought something worse was waiting for me. This ability won’t help him win, it will just delay his defeat.’</p><br><p>Lyrod was about to act when he was met with Adam’s broad grin.</p><br><p>Then, Lyrod blinked as Adam appeared in front of him while two rods formed in his hands.</p><br><p>Before Lyrod could comprehend this, Adam plunged the rods into his shoulders, tearing his tendons and ripping his muscles.</p><br><br><p>With a painful groan, Lyrod recoiled as red threads flashed before his eyes.</p><br><br><p>He looked at his sword, which was only slightly filled, but… at the same time, Adam’s sword lost some of its light.</p><br><p>By wounding Lyrod, Adam had made the situation better for himself.</p><br><p>True, Lyrod’s wound had already been healed, but this situation allowed Adam to act more recklessly than ever.</p><br><p>Could the conditions be any better for him?</p>
