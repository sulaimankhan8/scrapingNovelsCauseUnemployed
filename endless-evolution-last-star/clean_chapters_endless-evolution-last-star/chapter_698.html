            <br><p>Not all monsters were savage beasts, and even if they were they weren't mindless killers - the Mighty Commander or Essence Thunder Demon were clear evidence of that.</p><br><p>Adam was aware of this, and the deeper he delved into the Dead Lands the more rational and intelligent monsters he encountered, yet no one had ever tried to talk to him.</p><br><p>Sure, the Blind Commander said nothing. He couldn't, since his mouth and eyes were covered by tight bandages, but sign language was always available to the sighted and the unsighted.</p><br><p>"You want to enjoy the view before the battle? Alright, I won't refuse. You and I have nowhere to rush, do we?" Adam smiled bitterly before heading towards the Blind Commander.</p><br><p>The monster was not mistaken, for as Adam approached the Blind Commander moved slightly to the side making room for him.</p><br><p>For a moment Adam stood in a daze, not all people would have thought to do this for the convenience of their interlocutor, it could be intimidating, but Adam found it fascinating.</p><br><p>Saying nothing, Adam sat down next to the Blind Commander, his legs dangling off the edge of the platform.</p><br><br><p>A strong, cold wind whipped at their faces, fluttering Adam's hair tips and Blind Commander's bandages. Night was about to rise, but its time had not yet come, the slight warmth from the departing sun fell on their skin, softening the sharp currents of wind.</p><br><p>"Agh... I don't know if you can see anything through your bandages, but... This is definitely one of the best views I've ever witnessed."</p><br><p>From the middle level or even from the stairs, Adam could only see the scarlet light of the sunset, but being at the highest point within many kilometers, he could catch a glimpse of the last edges of the bright sun, losing its light with each passing second.</p><br><p>Turning around, on the other side Adam saw a white, slightly blue glow - from the moon about to rise.</p><br><p>"I won't lie, it's impossible to get the same view from the Citadel. Being in one place all the time you're limited on variety."</p><br><p>Adam put his palms together, exhaling a cold vapor as his eyes grew deeper.</p><br><p>"The Citadel is constantly changing, but not the territories around it, the Pacific Lands are static indeed."</p><br><p>They spent a few minutes in silence, like old friends meeting after a long parting, though it was their first encounter and quite possibly their last.</p><br><p>Soon the sun was completely hidden behind the horizon line, even for observers from this altitude, then the Blind Commander slowly rose.</p><br><br><p>He shook the dust off his knees, looking intently at Adam, waiting for his decision.</p><br><p>"Sure, shall we start now?"</p><br><p>A dangerous gleam passed across Adam's eyes, he was ready to rush into battle in a second if necessary.</p><br><p>The Blind Commander accepted the challenge, but Adam had a misconception of how he would get the final key.</p><br><br><p>With a leisurely stride, the Blind Commander approached the vivid stream of blue flame blazing from the spire, reaching out to the shadow lurking within.</p><br><p>With a powerful grip, the Blind Commander pulled from the flames a long sword with a blade as pale blue as ice crystals.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide. He wasn't surprised that the last weapon was a sword, that was one of his assumptions, but...</p><br><br><p>His eyes traveled to the edges of the sword.</p><br><p>'I can feel how cold this sword is, it's infused with a brutal frost, no flame can melt it...'</p><br><p>This once again taught Adam that Irregular Energy was not a strict set of rules, it was more like a recommendation.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you can use flames like the Solitary Commander or the Dark Watchers, but there's no point in trying to adjust to the conditions here if your pure power is beyond that."</p><br><p>Adam smiled, looking at the Blind Commander who pointed his weapon towards the ground, waves of cold steam sweeping upwards.</p><br><p>"I'm saying all the right things?"</p><br><p>With excitement, Adam got into a fighting stance, about to attack.</p><br><p>At the last moment, the Blind Commander reached his left hand forward with an open palm, stopping Adam.</p><br><p>"Agh...? Come on, you can't talk like all the monsters. Let's get started already!"</p><br><p>Unlike Adam, the Blind Commander was in no hurry, his patience was extraordinary.</p><br><p>He slowly guided his hand to his feet, then patted his chest, and finally held his palm in front of his face.</p><br><p>Then, the Blind Commander showed Adam three fingers before getting into a special stance, from his position it would be troublesome to attack and gain the speed he needed, but this was the easiest way to defend himself.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils dilated as the realization slowly came to him. Silvana realized it as well.</p><br><p>'Looks like he's not going to fight you to the death. He'll let you pass on if you can hit him three times at the bottom, middle, and top. At least that's the theory I believe in.'</p><br><p>Her voice was serious and confident. Normally, monsters didn't do that, but this was a Crown Type acting with an External Artifact. In that case, anything was possible.</p><br><br><p>Adam was confused which was clear from his wide-open eyes and trembling lips.</p><br><p>"Wait! I was coming here for a great fight! Fuck no! We're going to fight seriously!"</p><br><p>His outraged voice echoed around, reaching the lowlands of the fortress, yet it did not affect the Blind Commander.</p><br><br><p>With a desire to prove that he was worthy of a real fight, Adam dashed forward. In a frightening shadow, within a few leaps, he was right in front of the Blind Commander, his tightly clenched fist heading for the monster's bandaged face.</p><br><br><p>The Blind Commander took a step to the side, pushing his torso aside, Adam's fist flying right in front of his chest.</p><br><p>Adam's shocked eyes traveled towards the Blind Commander who for a moment let go of the hilt of his sword.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, the Blind Commander grabbed Adam's arm throwing him over, while Adam was in flight, the Blind Commander took a wide step forward, slamming his shoulder into Adam's stomach.</p><br><p>The impact was so direct and powerful that before Adam could blink he was already outside the platform, in an open fall.</p><br><br><p>Explore more at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>The ice sword had no sooner touched the ground as the Blind Commander caught it at the last moment, staring intently at the confused Adam, who was destined to fall to the lowest point.</p>
