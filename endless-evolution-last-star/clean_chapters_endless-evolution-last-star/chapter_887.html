            <br><p>"Gha..." Reinz took a deep breath, directing his gaze to his hands. He stopped on his rings.</p><br><p>Then, his eyes grew deeper like two crystals, pure and majestic, unique only to ones carrying the blood of the Alderran Family.</p><br><p>"From the looks of it, you've already used your Nexus. Well... In that case, I should do so as well, but it will bring us much closer to the finale."</p><br><p>Without further ado, Reinz's energy headed towards the rings as the first of the ten trembled slightly.</p><br><p>White electrical discharges erupted from the ring, the cracks in the surface shining brightly showing that the ring was activated.</p><br><p>Adam didn't know it, but Reinz didn't plan to activate all ten rings. In his opinion, there was simply no need to.</p><br><p>'If any other nobleman from the Twilight Palace were in your place, he would have lost at my first attack...'</p><br><br><p>Reinz stepped forward as something in him changed.</p><br><p>One short movement was enough for Adam to realize it.</p><br><p>'Did he get faster?' Adam suggested, 'I see... My rings do something similar, but I have two modes. In his case, it looks like it's just an increase in physical ability.'</p><br><p>Adam was wary, his eyes narrowed, 'But... How much stronger can he get? How much will each active ring give him?'</p><br><p>If Reinz could read minds he would surely smirk. For him, the fight was already close to being over.</p><br><br><p>With a whistle, Reinz appeared in front of Adam, his claws folded together like a spear moving towards Adam's chest.</p><br><p>As Adam expected, Reinz actually became faster. It wasn't a small enhancement, the speed had increased significantly.</p><br><br><p>'I have no trouble reacting to something like that!'</p><br><p>The silver blade got in the way of the sharp claws, sparks flew off to the sides, but no sooner had Reinz's attack come to an end than the second ring of ten shone brightly.</p><br><p>The pressure intensified as Reinz changed his grip and clutched the blade of the needle tightly. The needle was sharp, but not enough to pass through Reinz's gauntlets.</p><br><p>"Two rings..." Reinz watched Adam's reaction carefully, "You've made me use more than I wanted, though it's still within my expectations."</p><br><p>An excited smile covered Adam's face as he brushed Reinz away from him with a sharp movement.</p><br><p>"You think you can beat me with only two or three rings?" Adam bared his teeth, "Hah, that's not going to happen! You overestimate yourself, Reinz!"</p><br><p>Before he could finish speaking, electrical discharges appeared to his right.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes twitched but Reinz's fist was already smashing into his face, three rings shining brightly on his right hand.</p><br><p>"A third... That will be enough for you, Adam Vinter." Reinz stated without a hint of doubt in his gaze.</p><br><p>No sooner had Adam reached the ground than he tried to regain his balance to counterattack later, but Reinz was already on the other side.</p><br><p>Despite his words, the four rings were now activated. He didn't show it, but he didn't expect Adam to stay in place after his strike.</p><br><p>'Hmm... I thought he'd fly off to the side. I can't know everything - the important thing is to keep up the momentum and victory will come.'</p><br><br><p>With a deafening rattle, Reinz's fist smashed into Adam's jaw. Then, Reinz unclenched his fists and executed two diagonal swings.</p><br><p>Deep cuts in an X-shape lashed out at Adam's chest, blood gushing outward before his shocked eyes.</p><br><p>Yet, Reinz wasn't about to stop as his shadow fell on Adam from above.</p><br><p>The next moment, his knee plunged into Adam's stomach, driving him to the ground.</p><br><p>The powerful shudder passing along the North Arch was only a brief pause before Adam was hit with another hail of blows.</p><br><p>Reinz struggled to stay safe. He didn't just pummel Adam with his fists with all his might, he combined leaps, slashes, and simple punches, moving quickly around Adam, attacking from different directions.</p><br><p>For a while, Reinz turned into a ghost, leaving white electrical discharges after each leap. He had only one goal - the complete defeat for Adam.</p><br><p>The nobles glanced over, the smirks on their faces couldn't stop growing.</p><br><p>Their favorite was Reinz, mostly because he was a nobleman. If Adam, a commoner, won, it was a great humiliation for them.</p><br><p>The elder nobles watching the fight through the cameras were no exception. They let out a sigh of relief realizing that soon the fight would be over and they would gain territories - a small risk was a big reward.</p><br><p>Many turned around to see Silvana's reaction.</p><br><p>But, they saw nothing.</p><br><p>Silvana watched with a calm face as Reinz beat up Adam, almost replicating the scene of Giselle versus Adam.</p><br><p>'How strange...' she muttered inwardly, questioning her feelings, 'I'm sure a couple of days ago I would have been biting my nails to the point of bleeding from nerves, but... What is this strange peace? Why am I sure there's nothing to be afraid of? It's as if I can feel a part of what Adam is experiencing...'</p><br><p>Silvana's mind wanted to be nervous, but she couldn't convince herself that the threat was real.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Reinz jumped high up, bearing down on Adam like a shooting star.</p><br><p>The recoil threw Adam's body off the ground.</p><br><p>Reinz and all the spectators focused their gazes at one point, wanting to see the emptiness in Adam's eyes. This was meant to be the final attack.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam did not lose consciousness. His fingertips moved as he turned his head, still in the air.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Reinz's face turned pale, the nobles held their breath in disbelief at what they saw.</p><br><p>Adam smiled, not sadly at his impending defeat, but wildly as if in euphoria. His eyes narrowed slightly, dark but shining with pure delight.</p><br><p>"Reinz..." he wheezed, blood trickling down the many wounds on his body, "You have no idea how grateful I am."</p><br><p>Adam's feet touched the ground as he took a deep breath as if he had been underwater for a long time before.</p><br><p>"One minute of decent combat... Better than thousands of fights over the years... The real is always superior."</p><br><br><p>Adam glanced around.</p><br><p>"This arena is small for us. Don't you think so?"</p><br><p>There was no time for Reinz to realize what was happening, for between him and Adam, a white beam appeared out of nowhere - the path was made out.</p>
