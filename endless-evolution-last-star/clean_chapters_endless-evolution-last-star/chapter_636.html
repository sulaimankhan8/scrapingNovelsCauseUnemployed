            <br><p>As with Silvana, Adam was here alone. Once he was in Silvana's memories, the Evolution Tree disappeared, allowing him to see everything for himself.</p><br><p>Sure, it was the day Silvana was born, so Adam shouldn't be able to see what was happening around him, especially outside the chamber, but... these fragments were taken from the future to complete the picture.</p><br><br><p>Following the nurse, Adam found himself in a room where he saw a man in a formal suit sitting on a chair and a woman lying on a bed after a long labor.</p><br><p>The nurse smiled broadly, checking the woman's vitals to ensure she was okay.</p><br><p>"You did a great job. Have you picked out a name for your sweet angel yet?"</p><br><p>The woman smiled weakly, she was exhausted but there was boundless happiness in her eyes.</p><br><p>"Sure... We've been thinking about it for a long time and we have a suitable name."</p><br><p>The woman had long black hair and blue eyes, it was Silvana's mom - Matra Desio. The man had blonde, thick hair slicked back and his eyes were green as emeralds, this was Silvana's father - Aton Desio.</p><br><p>Matra's corners of her lips went up as she murmured looking at the infant wrapped in white cloths.</p><br><p>"Silvana Desio... That will be our daughter's name. Am I right, Aton?"</p><br><p>Keeping a calm, focused gaze, Aton nodded confidently.</p><br><p>"Yes. Our daughter will be the point from which our family's great legacy will begin. I am certain of it."</p><br><p>Aton squeezed Matra's hand tightly, he sounded serious but not cold, feeling the warmth both from Matra's hand and deep inside from Silvana's birth.</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, realizing that Silvana had taken her look from Aton and Matra, from each of the parents something specific.</p><br><p>"Hmm... I wonder what would have happened otherwise?" Adam rubbed his chin thoughtfully, "What would Silvana look like with blue eyes and blonde hair?"</p><br><p>Then, memories sped up.</p><br><p>Silvana was not from a rich family, Adam knew that, not from the questions she asked, but from the way she managed her finances and how much she allowed herself. Moreover, she lived on her Operator's salary, which was a clear indicator that she didn't have much spare money.</p><br><p>However, Silvana was not poor either and in comparison to Adam's family, they were quite wealthy. Yet, both of their families were poor relative to any family from the First Ring.</p><br><br><p>Silvana at the age of eight was coming home from school like most children her age. She was holding a bag of big red apples, she bought them at Matra's request.</p><br><p>The school was quite far from their home, but with the help of the extensive bus network and strictly controlled schedules, the kids had no problem getting to school and home on time.</p><br><p>Then, Adam's gaze traveled downward, looking at the house Silvana was heading toward.</p><br><p>"Well, well, it's certainly not a mansion, but it's quite decent, right?"</p><br><p>Unlike many of the city's houses done in futuristic or modern styles, Silvana's house looked ordinary and quiet.</p><br><p>It was a two-story concrete house with full wood trim, so externally it was all wood. The walls were painted a light, unremarkable color, and the roof was a triangular one of layered dark blue shingles.</p><br><p>Their house didn't stand out from the rest of the neighborhood, as all the houses here looked similar. Silvana's family lived quite far away from the big cities, in one of the special neighborhoods, there wasn't much infrastructure, but they had access to everything they needed and could always get to the nearest city quickly.</p><br><p>However, it was very quiet and peaceful like in the countryside which attracted many people but it was rather expensive to live there.</p><br><p>The neighborhood was on the far side of the Third Ring, very close to the Second Ring and Silvana's family had good reason to choose this place as their home.</p><br><p>Aton had a successful business that he started a few years before Silvana was born. Aton was a mechanic by trade, but he soon became a businessman when he opened three car workshops.</p><br><p>Part of his car workshops fixed simple cars used by ordinary people, while the other part worked with heavier vehicles such as delivery trucks.</p><br><p>Some workshops brought people from nearby towns to the Third Ring, while others repaired heavy vehicles from the Second Ring, where most of the transportation, factories, crop lands, and so on took place.</p><br><p>Moreover, Matra had inherited a family restaurant that operated in a nearby city and was known for its homemade food and natural products.</p><br><p>"Hah, Silvana's parents did a great job."</p><br><p>Adam smirked, he was genuinely happy for Silvana as her situation was much better than his when they were kids.</p><br><p>"Roughly speaking they have two businesses, a nice house in a quiet neighborhood, and a convenient location for both their family and restaurant and workshops."</p><br><p>Then, Adam's gaze grew darker as he narrowed his eyes:</p><br><p>"I don't think there's been any tragedy, but... it can't be that simple, right?"</p><br><p>Adam realized that the Evolution Tree was showing them their memories not to reveal some dark secret. It might just not have been.</p><br><p>"But... Everyone has hard times in life..." Adam muttered watching Silvana open the door.</p><br><p>Hearing the familiar click, Matra ran out of the kitchen to greet Silvana.</p><br><p>"Mom, I bought apples. Ten of them, big and red like you asked for." Silvana said calmly lifting the bag as proof.</p><br><p>Matra nodded deeply, she was wearing an apron, and a pleasant aroma wafted from the kitchen.</p><br><p>Continue reading on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Great, you're so good! Go wash your hands, soon your father will be back from work and we'll have dinner! The main course will be apple pie!" Matra ruffled Silvana's hair before returning to the kitchen.</p><br><p>Seeing such a cute scene before him, Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>"Damn, even when Silvana was little, she was just as calm."</p><br><p>For a few seconds, Adam was silent, watching everything from the sidelines. Then, with a heavy sigh, a bitter smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"Agh... you know..." Adam turned to the Evolution Tree, "I'm starting to envy her..."</p><br><p>But, there was no response. The Evolution Tree was only an observer, not knowing where this was going.</p>
