            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1194: Burning Gap</strong></p><br><p>No matter what the location, height, or depth, the Twilight Crystals could appear anywhere: at the bottom of the ocean, on a floating island, or right in a wall, which was the most common occurrence.</p><br><p>The Kirani Bugs knew where all their Twilight Crystals were located, and these were not the most easily accessible places, so they were confident that this would help them buy time.</p><br><p>However, Adam’s desire to know the limits of his abilities ruined their plans.</p><br><p>If he had used a vertical cut, he would most likely have exposed the Twilight Crystal, because he would have had to hit it directly. The chances of that were quite slim.</p><br><p>Because he cut the wall in half horizontally, he exposed everything behind it.</p><br><p>There should have been a stone or other tunnels, of which there were dozens at the Kirani Colony, but what he found turned out to be the most valuable thing possible.</p><br><p>The Kirani Bugs were not to blame for this, as they had no way of moving the Twilight Crystals. The crystals were where they had originally appeared.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Dozens of Kirani Guards, hundreds of Kirani Bugs, and two mysterious figures in the distance were quickly approaching Adam and Fromund.</p><br><p>Their frames filled the gap like countless shadows, only their green and red eyes were visible, as well as two pairs of amber ones, from previously unknown monsters.</p><br><p>Fromund turned as he prepared for battle. He didn’t have time to enjoy the sight of the Twilight Crystal, but he knew that now was not the time. They had to protect their find, or the angry Kirani Bugs would tear them to pieces.</p><br><p>“I’ll take the right side, alright?” Fromund asked, his energy like a raging flame surrounding him.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, indicating that he was going to take them all on himself.</p><br><p>“Don’t worry about it. Absorb the Twilight Crystals, right here and now. It won’t take long. Its energy is pure and ancient, your body will accept it without any resistance.”</p><br><p>“B-But! Just look at how many there are! This isn’t a group or a wave, it’s a whole horde of monsters!”</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam nodded.</p><br><p>“Yes, I can handle them. They wanted to delay us, now it’s our turn to use that tactic.”</p><br><p>Fromund wanted to refuse, but his Operator changed his mind.</p><br><p>‘He’s right,’ Arayna said sternly. ‘You need this not only for the Path Construct, but also to become stronger. Adam already has two types of energy, now it’s your turn.’</p><br><p>Adam’s aura grew stronger as two cold rods appeared in his hands, dark threads ready to pierce his enemies like tiny threads, allowing Adam to move across the battlefield like an unstoppable demon.</p><br><br><p>However, Fromund stepped forward, causing Adam to frown.</p><br><p>“Hey! Stop wasting time!”</p><br><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll do everything you said, I’ll just help you a little. I’ll give you an easy start!”</p><br><p>At the same moment, two red streams of flame passed through Fromund’s hands. However, this was not the usual energy from the global gene, it was one of his abilities.</p><br><p>Each stream turned into a small floating sword above his hands, each about the size of his palm. The sharp tips extended beyond his fingers.</p><br><p>‘Right… He used a sword as well before. His Nexus had a rather complex form,’ Adam thought to himself. ‘It seems his abilities have changed as much as mine. Hah, I should have expected that.’</p><br><p>Accepting Fromund’s help, Adam stepped back as Fromund swung his arms in different directions.</p><br><p>The swords sliced through the space, leaving fiery lines behind them. They disappeared only when they reached the edges of the gap, completely covering it.</p><br><p>Fromund grinned as he looked at the hundreds of Kirani Bugs that were already very close.</p><br><p>“It’s time to burn, insects!”</p><br><p>At the same moment, the line widened, releasing a furious stream of flame resembling a volcanic eruption, just as aggressive and chaotic.</p><br><p>The first Kirani Bugs didn’t even understand what had happened. The fire burned them, leaving not even a handful of ashes behind.</p><br><p>The rest tried to defend themselves, but they had no chance against Fromund’s fire.</p><br><p>Only when more than a hundred of the Kirani Bugs in the vanguard had perished did the rest realize that they had to flee.</p><br><p>If Fromund had carried out this attack in an open field, they could have flown away or dodged, but here, in the gap of the cut wall, they had much less space than in the cave.</p><br><p>All the space between the colony and the Twilight Crystal was filled with flames.</p><br><p>Even the Kirani Guards were powerless against Fromund’s attack. They were fast enough to escape, but that prevented them from completing their mission.</p><br><br><p>However, two figures rushed through the fire, cutting through it with their swords.</p><br><p>Fromund’s eyes widened. He wanted to know who had done that and fight them.</p><br><br><p>Adam grabbed him by the shoulder, roughly pushing him back.</p><br><br><p>Confused, Fromund blinked several times.</p><br><p>Adam glared at him, momentarily reminding him of Arayna, who always looked at him that way when he forgot his mission.</p><br><p>“Consume the Twilight Crystal! You’ve done your job!”</p><br><p>As much as Fromund wanted to join Adam in the fight against the two new Kirani Bugs, he knew he was right.</p><br><p>Clenching his fists tightly, Fromund turned and headed for the Twilight Crystal.</p><br><p>At the same time, the sounds of battle rang out behind him. The fleeing Kirani Bugs were returning to the gap, while two bugs armed with swords attacked Adam from both sides with great speed and skill.</p><br><p>‘This… Hah, this is incredible! I want it, right now!’ Fromund exclaimed inwardly.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, no one could stop him.</p><br><p>Bathild and Marhen were too far away.</p><br><p>In fact, Fromund should have thanked Adam for this opportunity, who decided to use the Imaginary Cut against the Kirani Sentinels, but now he wasn’t thinking about that.</p><br><br><p>As soon as Fromund touched the perfect black orb, everything around him stopped. All energy ceased to matter except for the dark stream that headed straight for him, fulfilling one of the conditions for his first star at the Path Construct.</p>
