            <br><p>Adam and Lola followed Edir, who was heading for the stairs leading to the second floor. Unlike Adam, Lola had been to the D-Zone many times before, so she wasn't as surprised as Adam.</p><br><p>'What the fuck is going on here...?' Adam internally muttered, looking at the prisoners on the first floor.</p><br><p>In the F-Zone, the prisoners had no entertainment, just socializing and exercising without sports equipment. However, the D-Zone prisoners had many more ways to entertain themselves and brighten up their leisure time!</p><br><p>The prisoners in the common room had couches, bookcases, and even a gym with a few exercise machines!</p><br><p>Sure, each of them could afford a lot more on the outside, but compared to F-Zone, it was a significant improvement in quality of life.</p><br><p>Moreover, on both the first and second floor, each prisoner had a separate cell. The cells on the first floor were smaller and more modest. They were similar to Adam's past cell, with a bed and a couch.</p><br><p>"You don't seem faintly surprised, do you?" Edir smirked, striding forward confidently with his hands in his pockets.</p><br><p>read-first-at-MVLeMpYr</p><br><br><p>"I take it. In the following zones, I will see conditions comparable to the best hotels in the Citadel... Hah..." Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"Yeah. You're right." Edir waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, for he wasn't serious about this. However... he also hadn't expected Edir to answer him, not Lola.</p><br><br><p>The gate opened, as they climbed to the top - the second floor. Like in the F-Zone, there was a dining room, but... Adam immediately noticed the differences.</p><br><p>If in the dining room of the F-Zone, there were only trays of food, that appeared on a conveyor belt, in the D-Zone several cooks were working! Two girls cut the ingredients, while an experienced-looking man constantly prepared the food.</p><br><p>They weren't just cooking for the Phantoms on the second floor, the food went down to the first floor on the conveyor belt, but the Phantoms on the second floor had the opportunity to choose and order just like in a restaurant.</p><br><p>"Hey! Chef, three steaks, a salad, and a mango ice cream with caramel!" Edir said, rather casually as if he had done this many times before.</p><br><p>The chef, with a sharp look, only nodded, getting to work.</p><br><p>Just ten minutes later, the food was on the table that Lola had brought them.</p><br><p>"Bon appetit!" Edir folded his hands together, a wide smile on his face, before beginning his meal.</p><br><p>"Adam...? Why aren't you eating?" Edir raised an eyebrow, "Are you a vegetarian? However, you haven't touched the salad either."</p><br><p>Adam shook his head as he pulled out his card, with the number '0' on it.</p><br><p>"You won't get in trouble for me eating here? I mean, you have to have at least 900 points for that, don't you?" Adam asked.</p><br><p>Edir shook his head.</p><br><p>"I brought you here, so it's fine. What's more, you're not going to stay here for long, are you?" Edir smirked, setting a juicy piece of steak on his knife.</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a serious expression.</p><br><p>"By the way... I have a similar question for you." Adam muttered with a concentrated look as he cut his steak.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Edir gave him a questioning look.</p><br><p>"Why are you here? Your aura isn't as powerful as Prago's, but I'm sure it's enough to pass for C-Zone or even B-Zone. You're strong and know things I don't, not yet." Adam said calmly. At the last words, a sharp glint passed across his eyes.</p><br><p>Edir chuckled evilly.</p><br><p>"Well... I was just waiting for you. I was informed of your arrival by Tron, or rather he did it through my Operator, and she then told me, anyway you get the idea." Edir shrugged, continuing to eat.</p><br><br><p>"Tron...? You two know each other...?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><br><p>"Something like that. If it weren't for his message, I would have gotten a lot farther, but I decided to wait for you. In fact, I thought you'd need more time, I gave you three days, after which I would have left D-Zone. However... he wasn't lying when he said someone special was going to Fall Hill Prison."</p><br><p>"How much did he tell you about me?" Adam narrowed his eyes.</p><br><br><p>Then, he waved his hand carelessly.</p><br><p>"Nothing more than that. He didn't even tell me your name. Just that an unusual guy is coming soon. Honestly!"</p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily. He didn't know if Edir was telling the truth or not, however, it didn't really matter.</p><br><p>"What are you in here for? What's your sentence? Why you didn't go any further and decide to stay in the D-Zone? And... This isn't the first time you've been here, is it?" Adam asked several questions at once.</p><br><p>Edir scratched his chin as if wondering if he should answer that.</p><br><p>"Alright, I hope you don't get off in the next zone. I'll tell you a little about myself." Edir looked sideways at one of the two cook girls.</p><br><p>"You're right. This is my second time here and last time, I made it to the last Zone in three days and got out in ten days, even though I was supposed to be in jail for two years. This time, I locked up for a year, upon arriving at the Citadel, I had a dispute with another squad that stole a valuable Nest from our squad."</p><br><p>Edir continued, gesturing vigorously. It was obvious, that he had no regrets about the incident and recounted it as an interesting memory.</p><br><p>"Me and my guys did all the work, and those bastards took the most important thing. At first, I wanted to settle things amicably, but... pretty soon they pissed me off...</p><br><p>Anyway, I beat up a few Phantoms, and I broke the Nexus and almost all the bones of their head bastard. He's lucky I didn't kill him." Edir snorted as if regretting that he hadn't done more, even though he could.</p><br><p>Then, Edir glanced at the food, especially the mango ice cream.</p><br><p>"I could have waited for you at the F-Zone, but I think you've seen how disgusting the food there is. It's okay to eat there, but... it's not worth it. The conditions here are quite normal." Edir leaned back in his chair, putting his hands behind his head.</p><br><p>Adam finished his meal in silence, pushing the plates aside and staring intently at Edir, releasing his powerful aura.</p><br><p>"Fine... I think that's enough talking. I don't know if you're just bored and need a partner or if you have some hidden motives, but... I want you to tell me how to use aura. Teach me."</p><br><p>"No." Edir replied sharply.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide with a slight shiver through his body. He hadn't expected Edir to say no, after all, he had said the exact opposite a few minutes ago!</p><br><p>Edir pointed to his green card with a sly smile on his face.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry, but until you reach 999 points, I'm not going to train you. More specifically... I won't tell you how to learn this power, the training will be on you." Edir uttered.</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, Edir whispered:</p><br><p>"I'll give you a hint. You can challenge anyone on the second floor and win to get 999 points. They have no right to refuse. But..." Edir waved his hand, "I don't advise you to challenge me, even if you win I'll take offense and won't help you!"</p><br><p>Adam's eye began to twitch. Indeed, Edir just wanted to watch Adam fight someone!</p>
