            <br><p>"Well, well... One last challenge before I finally step forward, isn't it?"</p><br><p>With a calm gaze, Adam watched the hasty destruction of the crystal, the flesh clots ripping open and releasing thin trickles of blood.</p><br><p>Could Adam stop the arrival of his future opponents? That was the unknown. Unlike the ritual preparing for something greater, the three monsters in the crystal and the flesh clots had long been ready to fight.</p><br><p>Adam would only expose himself to an unreasonable risk by attacking them prematurely. One way or another, he wouldn't leave the temple until he killed every monster in his path.</p><br><br><p>Adam slowly turned his head looking at the dozen monsters actively working. They were trying to complete the ritual to fulfill their overlord's expectations. Sure, each monster had its motives, just like humans, but the powerful force made them work together.</p><br><p>"I don't have time to deal with each of you individually. So, there's a way to make this quick."</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam's aura became significantly stronger. White flames were billowing in all directions, quickly transforming into the silhouette of a ghostly tailor.</p><br><p>As the Phantom progressed, his aura changed, usually between levels, but there were no strict rules, just a gap between levels allowed to show the difference in strength.</p><br><p>At first, Adam's Spirit was no different from its previous version in the battle against Fromund. Adam didn't expect his Spirit to change in any way, as it would still be at the same level.</p><br><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam's eyes went wide when black energy came out of his body without his knowledge.</p><br><p>He didn't have that kind of energy, it solely belonged to the Two Walls. By the end of the way, they grew so strong that Adam could hardly control them. Every now and then, the black particles would break free of his will, acting on their own desires.</p><br><br><p>The black particles became part of his Spirit, they didn't change anything in base but turned into gloves for Adam's tailor.</p><br><p>The short gloves made of myriad particles of darkness contrasted strongly with Adam's white energy. Yet, the importance of the appearance of his aura was nothing compared to how much more intense the pressure had become.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Dozens of monsters froze in place, their bodies trembling with fear, they struggled to stay on their feet, holding on with all their might to keep from collapsing to the ground.</p><br><p>Soon, Adam felt the heat from the sun seal, Lone Blaze's voice rang through his mind.</p><br><p>[Oh, how curious... It seems you're ignoring more than just my pleas to hurry. I even feel sorry for those strange walls, they've been in my place for much longer. But... I'm not that patient.]</p><br><p>Adam frowned. He didn't understand what was going on with his aura, so he didn't have time to deal with Lone Blaze's complaints.</p><br><p>"Hey, if you want to talk about your feelings then pick another moment. Tell me directly what you want."</p><br><br><p>[It's nothing, I just want to participate in a little transformation of your aura too.]</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, several tongues of flame appeared amongst his white energy, at Lone Blaze's will the red flames headed towards the ghostly tailor's chest, gathering into a dense core.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Waves of energy came out from the core with each of Adam's heartbeats, the scarlet circles increasing in power with distance, magnifying their pressure on the monsters.</p><br><p>Some of them could no longer stand on their feet, they collapsed to the ground in an attempt to keep the formidable aura from crushing them like insects.</p><br><p>Realizing that his aura was now using Lone Blaze's power, Adam's eyes darted downwards in a rush, looking at the sun seal.</p><br><br><p>Lone Blaze smirked, enjoying Adam's confusion.</p><br><p>[As long as I'm in your inner space I can influence things related to it with my power. It didn't take much effort for me to make your weak aura a little stronger].</p><br><p>Hearing Lone Blaze's last words, Adam's eyebrow twitched as his expression distorted into a grimace.</p><br><p>"What? Are you saying that my aura is weak? Do you think I'd fall for such a bad provocation?"</p><br><br><p>Adam's corners of his lips twitched, if Lone Blaze was in front of him now he would make it regret its words, but he had other things to do.</p><br><p>"Alright, I'll deal with you later. After all, my aura got much stronger than I expected."</p><br><p>Casting a glance at the trembling monsters, he reached his hand forward, fingers spread wide.</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam clenched his hand into a fist, his Spirit completely replicating all of his actions, putting pressure on the monsters that they couldn't withstand.</p><br><br><p>Several Inferior Adherents kneeling on their knees exploded. Their bodies burst into pieces, instilling fear in the other monsters - they realized that this was only the beginning.</p><br><p>It was known that an aura could only deal internal damage to a single creature once, but if the power gap was large enough, instant death was achieved in a single hit.</p><br><p>The same fate as the Inferior Adherents befell the Carnage Jaws, they were creatures of the same level, weak helpers of stronger monsters.</p><br><br><p>Adam snorted irritably looking at the Thirst Redeemers and the Vile Believers. Neither of them could confidently withstand the onslaught of his aura and continue standing on their feet, but the pressure wasn't strong enough to kill them.</p><br><p>Sure, they received one serious internal wound, blood gushing from their jaws, but the monsters were far from dead.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a massive hand whipped out from the left side of the crystal, red skin covering the trembling muscles, short thick fingers on a heavy palm ending in sharp black nails.</p><br><p>Adam was wary getting ready to fight against the crimson crystal creature.</p><br><p>But... soon something made his eyes go wide.</p><br><br><p>Two silhouettes fell from the flesh clots, blood dripping off their backs in rivers, making it impossible to distinguish their silhouette at once, yet for Adam everything became obvious in an instant.</p><br><p>"What... I've already killed you..."</p><br><p>The two commanders, Solitary and Mighty, struggled with trembling limbs to rise to their feet as if they were just born and learning to walk.</p>
