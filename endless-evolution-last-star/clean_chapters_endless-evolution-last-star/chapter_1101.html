            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1101: World Wipe (Part 2)</strong></p><br><br><p>To Adam, that number sounded like an eternity. He recently turned 18, though he completely forgot about his birthday in the fall due to the overwhelming number of events that flooded his life over the past year after he became a Phantom.</p><br><p>True, he had spent several years in a special space under the influence of Queen Elisa’s power, but this affected his mind more than his body, and at that time, he was engaged in only one thing — fighting.</p><br><p>As a young Phantom, he went through many battles, victories, and defeats. He did not stop and constantly moved forward, since new problems and desires appeared on his path.</p><br><p>With a few exceptions, the only periods when he did not move along the path of power were the days and weeks when he was recovering from serious injuries. When he needed time to recover after another great battle.</p><br><p>What he achieved in one year was more than possible, but it was very rare. This only happened to those Phantoms who desired power more than anything else in the world and did not make a fatal mistake at any of the dozens of stages.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam made mistakes many times, perhaps too many, but he was still alive, which meant that his mistakes were not as serious as those of others who no longer walked this world.</p><br><p>So, it was no surprise that as soon as Wilfred mentioned seven years, a broad smile appeared on Adam’s face.</p><br><p>“Seven years? Fuck! That’s almost an eternity! We’ll definitely be able to come up with something in that time!” Adam exclaimed, clenching his fist tightly. “I’ll become a Second Rank Phantom and… and… I’m sure I’ll figure out a plan to fix everything!”</p><br><p>Unlike Adam, whose eyes were burning with fire, Silvana did not share his optimism. Her gaze was gloomy.</p><br><p>She understood that if Wilfred, the other Second Rank Phantoms, and the strongest Lords couldn’t stop the World Wipe even once, what chance did they have with Adam?</p><br><p>The answer was simple and not at all what Adam had hoped for.</p><br><p>Wilfred didn’t rush to tell Adam how foolish and unrealistic his idea was. He had plenty of experience with that.</p><br><p>“Well, there’s nothing wrong with what you’re saying, but first you have to reach Second Rank. Before you say you’ll do it in an instant, stop.”</p><br><p>Adam did it. He didn’t rush, although his whole demeanor indicated that he was confident it would be easy for him.</p><br><p>Wilfred glanced to the side, fixing his gaze on the tops of the three other towers.</p><br><p>“I think you’ve heard this many times, Adam, reaching the Second Rank is much more difficult than becoming a Phantom and going all the way from the K1 to the K4 Level. Whether you like it or not, that’s the way it is. Maybe you, as a talented, lucky, and unstoppable Phantom, were able to make it to the K4 Level, but that doesn’t mean you’ll reach the Second Rank even in the next 50 years.”</p><br><p>Adam leaned forward as he was about to say something, but the sharp gleam that flashed across Wilfred’s eyes stopped him.</p><br><p>“I know what you’re thinking: I’ve become a K4 Phantom, I’m just one step away from the Second Rank! I can do it if I try hard and keep winning and recklessly throwing myself into battle against the strongest monsters!” Wilfred waved his hand mockingly.</p><br><p>In confirmation of his words, Adam shuddered. He didn’t want to admit it, but Wilfred read his thoughts.</p><br><p>Coldness filled Wilfred’s eyes. “Maybe you can do it, but it’s time to grow up, Adam. Just because you’ve become strong quickly and fuck your Operator doesn’t mean you’ve stopped being a child in your mind.”</p><br><p>Silvana blushed but didn’t protest. In general, she agreed with Wilfred, although… she’d have chosen different words for it.</p><br><p>“But…! I’m progressing fast! I mean, I’m not being arrogant, it’s just a fact.”</p><br><p>Wilfred nodded. “Yeah, that’s true. However, you’re forgetting that you’ve only just become a K4-Phantom. Roughly speaking, you’ve passed the K0-K3 Levels, now you have to pass the most difficult and longest K4-Level. Only after that will you have the opportunity to try to move from the K4-Level to the Second Rank.</p><br><p>“As you understand, this is no easy task, to say the least. There are quite a lot of K4-Phantoms, while the Second Rank Phantoms are critically few. There are even fewer of us than the True Lords, so… your chances aren’t particularly high, although, like every Phantom, they have always been above zero.”</p><br><p>Wilfred’s direct and stern speech calmed Adam, as if a bucket of cold water had poured over his fiery frame.</p><br><p>A minute later, he sorted out his thoughts and nodded. He was ready to move on.</p><br><p>“Wilfred, you said that the next World Wipe will happen in seven years, but… how often does the Last Star come to our world? I mean, from what I understand, you, like the other Second Rank Phantoms and Lords, have already experienced the Last Star’s descent once.”</p><br><p>A slight smile appeared on Wilfred’s face.</p><br><p>“Come on, share your thoughts. How often do you think it happens?”</p><br><p>“Hmm…” Adam scratched his cheek thoughtfully. “Every hundred years? I mean, if it happened more often, there wouldn’t be any old people on the streets.”</p><br><p>Wilfred glanced at Silvana.</p><br><br><p>Silvana sighed. “I think it’s less often. Once every 150 years. That would explain the age of some monsters. Well, the ones who mentioned it.”</p><br><p>“Hah, your Operator is much closer, Adam.”</p><br><p>Wilfred threw his cigarette aside, watching it fall to the bottom of his tower.</p><br><p>“Once every 250 years.”</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana froze.</p><br><p>“That’s why you might have heard some people and monsters say how sorry they are that you have so little time left. Although… you don’t have anything to worry about anymore.”</p><br><p>Yes, Wilfred was right. He said exactly what Adam was thinking.</p><br><p>“What does that mean?” Adam looked at him.</p><br><p>Wilfred chuckled grimly.</p><br><p>“Neither of you is in danger of dying. Not anymore, but… that doesn’t mean you’ll like life after the World Wipe.”</p>
