            <br><p>Silvana nervously looked from side to side before asking again:</p><br><p>"What...? So you mean you're not going to force Adam to marry you? I mean, you've decided that?"</p><br><p>Osana rested her cheek on her hand curiously scrutinizing Silvana's face, when she was this vulnerable, Osana could see right through Silvana.</p><br><p>"Nah, and I can't. Technically, upon winning The Rule of Power, all control about the wedding and my fate as a bride goes into Adam's hands, since he'll be the winner, I'm sure of it."</p><br><p>Then, Osana continued:</p><br><p>"No matter what his decision will be, me, my fiancé, the Rouzet and the Marzo Families will have to accept it. Hah, I'm quite curious as to what he'll choose."</p><br><p>Osana smirked as she leaned forward and licked her lips predatorily in front of Silvana's face.</p><br><p>"You know, I shudder just thinking about what would happen if he wanted to make me his. What do you think he'll do on our wedding night? I will not resist my husband's wishes, I am a very obedient wife."</p><br><p>Osana practically whispered her last words into Silvana's ears, making her mind think of things it shouldn't, as a consequence her face quickly turned as red as a tomato.</p><br><p>"Hahahahahahahahahaha!"</p><br><p>Osana laughed thoroughly enjoying Silvana's reaction.</p><br><p>"Relax, I'm just kidding. I'm sure that won't happen."</p><br><p>Silvana's lips quivered, but she took a deep breath and pulled herself together.</p><br><p>"So... You're not going to become his wife?"</p><br><p>Osana nonchalantly waved her arms to the sides.</p><br><p>"I don't know. Jokes aside, as a woman I can say that Adam is a good option, especially for a rebel noblewoman like me. But... the chances of him seeing me as a woman, let alone a love interest, tend toward zero."</p><br><p>Silvana didn't notice it, but when she heard Osana's reply, she breathed a sigh of relief.</p><br><p>Osana puffed up her cheeks as she looked away, watching the city streets and random passersby through the wide window.</p><br><p>"What a strange situation... I saved his life, proposed marriage to him, and got his consent to help me. But... I'm sure I'm just a battle mate to him. Not that I've been in love with him for a long time like some women experience, but it's still not an ordinary situation."</p><br><p>Silvana smirked, seeing that Osana was a little disappointed.</p><br><p>"Well, if I were you, I'd be glad you managed to find a Phantom willing to help with your situation."</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, I guess you're right. Agh, we'll see what happens in 85 days."</p><br><p>Silvana raised an eyebrow, unsure of what to ask:</p><br><p>"That's your wedding day. I'm sure your family reminds you of it all the time."</p><br><p>In response, she received only a slight nod from Osana.</p><br><p>"Hah." Silvana smirked, "I had a moment to imagine what will happen when your family finds out what you're up to. It's going to be quite a show."</p><br><p>For the first time in their entire conversation, Osana agreed with Silvana, the same devious smirk appearing on her face.</p><br><p>"Right, their faces... those will be unforgettable grimaces. They will be shocked, angry, and arrogant. None of them will believe that I found a Phantom capable of winning in The Rule of Power. But..."</p><br><p>Osana wanted to finish her sentence, but she was interrupted by Silvana, who seemed to know what Osana was thinking.</p><br><p>Your journey continues on empire</p><br><p>"But when Adam appears, the certainty of victory will fade, and deep in their hearts there will be anxiety."</p><br><p>Two cups of coffee. They had placed their order some time ago but had yet to take a single sip. The topic of their conversation was too important to be distracted by anything, but now everything was settled.</p><br><p>Osana elegantly took the cup and took a sip of the bitter drink. One way or another, she couldn't completely escape the rules of etiquette she was taught as a noblewoman.</p><br><p>However, Silvana's movements were not much different, there was nothing special about it.</p><br><p>"All that's left is to wait 85 days, right?" Osana asked rhetorically, raising her eyes from the cup to Silvana.</p><br><br><p>"Yes, actually in a way I'm glad it happened."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Osana raised an eyebrow in confusion, "What are you talking about?"</p><br><br><p>"85 days, that's a pretty long time. Maybe to some, it's only three months, but to Adam, that's more than half the time he's been a Phantom."</p><br><br><p>"He had plans for things to do in the Citadel, but I'm sure he wouldn't wait even two weeks before heading back into the Dead Lands. However, he will now have three months of hard training right after he became K2. That's good for his future. I'm sure of it."</p><br><p>Osana's eyes went wide for a moment.</p><br><p>"By the way... He mentioned that too. When does his training start? I don't want to push it, but the sooner the better, if it's in a week, that would be just fine."</p><br><p>At her question, Silvana set aside her cup of coffee and shook her hand, exposing her wrist in front of her. She looked at her electronic watch.</p><br><p>"Oh, good thing you asked. I should hurry up already. Everything starts in an hour. I think I'll leave now too." Silvana said calmly before quickly finishing her coffee and rushing towards the exit.</p><br><p>Osana blinked a few times. She didn't seem to expect Silvana to change her behavior so drastically and go from calm mode to rushing.</p><br><p>She didn't bother to stop Silvana, instead, Osana just took the next sip while reflecting on their conversation.</p><br><p>"Excuse me, will you be ordering anything else?"</p><br><p>Suddenly, a waiter approached Osana, transferring his gaze from her to the empty cup of coffee.</p><br><p>Osana nodded slowly.</p><br><p>"Yeah... Some dessert, any dessert of your choice." Osana waved her hand.</p><br><p>The waiter nodded with a slight smile on his face before walking away, leaving her alone.</p><br><p>'I wonder who Adam is going to train with? It must be someone special too. I'll have to find out.' Osana pondered.</p><br><br><br><p>At this time, Silvana was hurriedly calling for a car since the practice location was quite far from this coffee shop.</p><br><p>Tron always approached his business with seriousness and strictness, well, if he agreed to help, which was hard to get him to do.</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip nervously.</p><br><p>'Shit, hurry up! If I'm late, not only me but Adam too!' Silvana inwardly exclaimed, realizing that Tron was a stern man.</p>
