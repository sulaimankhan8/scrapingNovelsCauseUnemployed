            <br><p>Until a moment ago, Oskar had been in the majority. True, Adam and Katrin disagreed with him, but he still had three loyal companions who would definitely follow his orders and head for the safe zone.</p><br><p>Four fairly strong Phantoms were more than enough to get out of this part of the Fallen Crypt, especially when there was one support with healing abilities among them.</p><br><p>But... just then, everything changed. Osana going from one side to the other was much more critical than if Erla or Lero had done it.</p><br><p>Moreover, there was no way Oskar could stick to his original plan now because there were too few enemies.</p><br><p>There was only one Gray Stalker and one Scarlet Pyromancer against them, and they had Adam on their side who was capable of killing a Top-2 monster, so... they had a serious advantage in strength.</p><br><p>Burning Osana with his gaze and clutching his sword tightly, Oskar gritted his teeth and said:</p><br><p>"Osana, after this mission, we will have a serious talk." Oskar said seriously, with great reluctance gradually agreeing to their terms.</p><br><p>"Sure." Osana calmly replied. She wasn't afraid of sanctions from Oskar, to her this situation was a simple transaction. She had exchanged Oskar's respect for Adam's one it was a favorable trade.</p><br><p>Then, Oskar looked at the remaining Gray Stalker.</p><br><p>"Fine, let's kill him, then you quickly finish off Scarlet Pyromancer and we'll be done with this shitty situation." Oskar snorted before stepping forward, confidently heading towards Gray Stalker.</p><br><p>Adam nodded and cast a glance at Osana.</p><br><p>"Don't expect me to thank you, it's obvious even to a child that you didn't do this for us but for yourself." Adam said calmly, narrowing his eyes slightly.</p><br><p>Osana touched her pink lips with her little finger and smiled slightly.</p><br><p>"Sure, but whatever you say now doesn't matter, because what I did will forever be etched in your memory and have the appropriate effect."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised.</p><br><p>"Damn, you're not even hiding your intentions. Well, I won't deny that I look at you differently now, but don't jump to conclusions." Adam calmly replied, following Oskar's lead.</p><br><p>"Katrin come on. It's time to kill the Scarlet Pyromancer and get a new Initial Gene, isn't it?"</p><br><p>Katrin looked up at him as her eyes sparkled with excitement.</p><br><p>She gripped her staff tighter and directed her gaze towards Scarlet Pyromancer. Sometimes, bad luck for some could turn out to be a fortune for someone else, and right now Katrin was on the right side for her.</p><br><p>"Sure, kill that pathetic dog already." Katrin grinned widely.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam and Oskar ran forward. Though they had been in conflict, they had both been in enough battles to recover in time and get control over their feelings.</p><br><p>Running up to Gray Stalker, Adam and Oskar glanced at each other, nodded slightly, and surrounded the monster from both sides.</p><br><p>Oskar attacked first. He brought his massive sword high above his head, swiftly bringing it down on Gray Stalker.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Oskar's attack was successful. His sword accurately hit its target, sinking into Gray Stalker's flesh.</p><br><p>"Agh...? What the hell...?" Oskar's eyes went wide looking at his sword that stuck into Gray Stalker.</p><br><p>Oskar was sure he was about to cut the monster in two, since Gray Stalker didn't have any additional defenses besides its hide, but that didn't happen.</p><br><p>His sword just couldn't penetrate deeper than a few centimeters. Oskar wasn't even sure if his sword even reached the monster's bone and it actually made him wary.</p><br><p>"RRRRRRGHHHH!!!" Gray Stalker roared before pouncing on Oskar, aiming its sharp claws at Oskar's chest.</p><br><p>Bam. Stay updated via mvl</p><br><p>Immediately, Adam appeared beside Oskar, who abruptly turned around and smashed his foot right into Gray Stalker's jaw.</p><br><p>The kick was straight and clear, with tremendous force and even greater speed. Considering the size of the Gray Stalker, the impact should have thrown the monster aside and precisely knocked out its jaw with serious damage.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Gray Stalker's skin trembled, waves passing over the monster's face as if it were a calm water surface that had been disturbed by a suddenly fallen stone. And... the shivering stopped as quickly as it had begun.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Gray Stalker swiftly turned its head, quickly closing its powerful jaws in front of Adam's face like a powerful snare that would tear Adam's head from his body.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide in disbelief. He couldn't believe that such a weak-looking monster like Gray Stalker could recover from his attack in just one second.</p><br><p>'I see... So that's how big the difference between levels is, right? The head of the weakest monster of the Purple Threat Level would have exploded from my kick, that's for sure, but it had a weaker effect on him than a simple slap. Damn, and that's just the physical stats. Unbelievable.'</p><br><p>Adam pondered while Gray Stalker's jaw opened wide in front of his face. The teeth were sharp and long, about to sink into Adam's neck.</p><br><p>'Hmm... His hide is as tough as his whole body, but...' Adam muttered internally directing his gaze to the Gray Stalker's long ears, 'Inside we're all weak and vulnerable, both physically and mentally.'</p><br><p>Whoooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>Adam's back arched backwards causing his bones forcing his bones to emit an active cracking sound. Gray Stalker had no time to react and change the trajectory of its attack, so the monster's open jaw swept over Adam's head.</p><br><p>Then, Adam's arms came in motion quickly heading for Gray Stalker's head. He blasted the man's head once with his powerful palms, but he realized that against Gray Stalker, it was impossible to do so.</p><br><p>His palms wouldn't be able to inflict even the slightest damage to the monster's thick hide, let alone explode Gray Stalker's head.</p><br><p>But... Adam's goal was something else.</p><br><br><p>Adam thrust his middle fingers perpendicularly forward before plunging them into Gray Stalker's ears reaching for the monster's brain.</p><br><p>Two streams of dark blood rushed out, coating Adam's arms and running down his wrists while Gray Stalker's face squirmed in pain.</p><br><p>It was as if the monster was trying to get rid of the foreign object in its head, but it was too late. Gray Stalker's ears were its weak point, for they were wide open and too close to the brain because of the elongated structure of the skull.</p><br><p>A few drops of blood fell on Adam's calm face as the monster's head was directly above him.</p><br><p>'I guess I should congratulate you. Not many K1-Phantoms have killed Light Yellow Threat Monsters, in a way that's quite an accomplishment.' Silvana said with a slight pride in her voice.</p><br><p>However... Adam did not share her enthusiasm.</p><br><p>"Hm... They're actually strong, but some Essence Thunder Demon would tear apart even ten of them. Gray Stalkers are strong, but they're nothing. I'd say they're just dull and boring opponents." Adam said calmly before pulling his fingers out of the monster's ears and letting its carcass fall to the cold gray ground.</p><br><p>Then, Adam took a step forward and held out his hand with an open palm summoning Revolve.</p><br><p>"It's been a while since I've absorbed any new genes, this should definitely be something new." Adam muttered with a slight smile on his face while Gray Stalker's body trembled slightly.</p>
