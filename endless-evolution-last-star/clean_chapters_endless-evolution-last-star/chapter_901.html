            <br><p>Reinz and Chloe were given the opportunity to be alone for a romantic dinner at the most appropriate time.</p><br><p>For the rest of us, however, the dinner wasn't canceled, it was simply moved to another location.</p><br><br><p>The waiter placed a large pizza with puffy edges and thin dough on the table, just one of several dishes at the square table.</p><br><p>Julia and Erik enjoyed the food, though Erik's case was much more focused on the appetizers and especially the wine. It was unknown how much the bottle he ordered cost, but Adam didn't want to know, he was scared.</p><br><p>He glanced around, watching the people in expensive suits, the waiters watching their every elegant movement, and the crystal chandeliers swaying on the high ceilings.</p><br><p>'Damn... This place is fancy as hell,' he thought, 'Hmm... I have more than enough money already, I just stopped thinking about it. I guess it's normal for K3-Phantom, yet... Somehow I'm still sure I'd be surprised at the prices here.'</p><br><p>"Find anything interesting?" Erik glanced at Adam, slowly shaking his wine glass.</p><br><p>"Not really, but... Mr. Erik, there's something I'd like to ask you."</p><br><p>With a slight smile, Erik shrugged, "Sure, go on. I don't plan on going home until deep into the night. I want to give Chloe and Reinz enough time to get to know each other closer, much closer..."</p><br><p>Silvana froze in place for a moment, then continued to eat without giving any sign, although her cheeks were flushed.</p><br><p>However, Adam didn't seem to understand what Erik was talking about or didn't want to. He was thinking about other things.</p><br><p>"The Void Lake, what is it? Why does Reinz want to go there? And... Why can't he do that? I mean, although he's not an elder, he holds not the last place in the first great family. It should be something special, right?"</p><br><p>"Hm..." Erik hummed, looking at Adam with a sly grin, "It depends. Do you want to go there too? I can arrange it, but then the Lower Ring is canceled."</p><br><p>"No, I'm not interested in that and I don't think I will be. I'm just curious."</p><br><br><p>Erik took a sip of wine.</p><br><p>"Because for you, the Void Lake will be useless."</p><br><p>"Agh?" Adam was confused.</p><br><p>Silvana turned in his direction. Unlike Julia and Erik, she didn't understand the reason for that answer.</p><br><p>"It's simple." Erik waved his hand, "What happened to you under Queen Elisa's space is the effect of the Void Lake, which varies from Phantom to Phantom."</p><br><p>"Wait..." Adam stammered, remembering his hundreds of fights and countless defeats, "That... How do you know?"</p><br><p>"I know a lot of things, Adam. Julia knows even more, so... together we know almost everything. In this case, though, I just saw it in your gaze."</p><br><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, his look growing darker.</p><br><p>"So it doesn't happen to every Phantom, then. In that case, I can see why Reinz is so eager to get to the Void Lake, that place will make him much stronger, though... hundreds of fights, that's a serious test of your mind."</p><br><br><p>No one said anything, only the sounds of a hall full of guests came from far away.</p><br><p>Then, Adam looked at Erik, his expression serious.</p><br><p>"The Queen... Is she even alive? I mean, I could see her breathing, but she looked more like a statue than a person. It's a strange feeling."</p><br><p>Erik brought the glass to his nose, inhaling the deep aroma.</p><br><p>"Sure, Queen Elisa is alive. There is no doubt about it. You can believe me. After all, not only me, but no one in the Citadel would lie about something related to the Queen herself."</p><br><p>"In that case..." Adam muttered as he squeezed his knees, "How old is Queen Elisa? She looks young, no more than 25, but... she's much older than that, isn't she?"</p><br><p>"Well, well... Now that's a question." Erik laughed briefly, a hint of darkness infused his voice, "I won't lie to you about the queen, but I don't have to answer. I'm sorry, but even when you are a K4-Phantom, you will have to work hard to find out that secret. All I can say is that Queen Elisa is not 25 years old, that's for sure."</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam wasn't upset.</p><br><p>He had expected a similar response. After all, when he was at Heaven Island, he got more questions than answers.</p><br><p>Silvana always knew more than Adam, but not this time. All she could do was stare at the smirking Erik, trying to read his mind, which was impossible.</p><br><p>'Adam, adam... Hah, you should focus on reaching K4-Level. You have more than enough time, but not an infinity.'</p><br><p>Then, Erik looked up, it seemed his gaze was aimed straight at the Heaven Island, invisible from the ground.</p><br><br><p>Because of Erik's initiative, they didn't get home until the next morning.</p><br><p>Adam had never been to so many bars and restaurants in one night. He felt like he had walked half of the Citadel in ten hours.</p><br><br><p>Four silhouettes got out of the car and approached the entrance to the luxurious mansion. It was very different from the others on the same street due to its ancient appearance, red bricks, tiled roof, and massive wooden doors as the main entrance.</p><br><p>As soon as they stepped inside the smell of fresh coffee and pancakes hit their noses.</p><br><p>Julia raised an eyebrow. She wanted to know who had decided to take charge of her kitchen.</p><br><p>Chloe stood at the stove, with a deft movement, she flipped one pancake after another, there was already a whole mountain to her left.</p><br><p>"Khm." Julia coughed, catching her attention.</p><br><p>"Oh! You're back already!" Chloe said cheerfully.</p><br><p>"Yeah, we are." Julia nodded. "Apparently, the evening went just fine. Where's that puppy from the noble family?"</p><br><p>Chloe was about to answer when a silhouette emerged from the aisle - Reinz showed himself. Steam was wafting off of him, his hair wet, and his only clothing was a beige towel tied around his waist.</p><br><p>Startled, Reinz quickly turned around and ran off to his room, holding the towel.</p><br><p>Only Julia's sarcastic comment rang out behind him.</p><br><p>"Hah, nice ass, cute boy!"</p>
