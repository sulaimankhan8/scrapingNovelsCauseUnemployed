            <br><p>The white flash was not as large as the massive, flaming meteorite, casting a shadow over the arena and part of the spectator seats, the eyes of the spectators in the darkness shining brightly like curious lanterns.
</p><br><p>However... the size of a star did not always determine its power, far more important was the brightness, the light emitted, and... the power lurking within.
</p><br><p>A small star with a vastly superior density was capable of effortlessly absorbing a larger star or simply destroying it...
</p><br><p>If it was not a star, but just an asteroid that decided to collapse on the earth in the embrace of flames, it was not even a confrontation.
</p><br><p>A sense of lightness and freedom filled Adam’s mind, currents of wind fluttering the black tips of his hair.
</p><br><p>Unlike his artifact’s ability, making him faster through lightning energy, the special attack of his needle did not make Adam faster as a creature.
</p><br><p>The needle tip, white energy was making a path for him, anywhere and along any trajectory. Anything in that path would be pierced by the energy-filled needle, and Adam would find himself at the other end of the path in a heartbeat, like a flash.
</p><br><p>If he tried to do something like that with his artifact, he would simply fall to the ground. Adam couldn’t fly or create objects beneath him that would allow him to move through the air.
</p><br><p>But, now he didn’t have that problem since he was at the very beginning of the white path, he wasn’t in danger of falling.
</p><br><p>Running a hand through his crimson hair, Fromund raised his head in disbelief.
</p><br><p>He wasn’t the only one like this, sharing the feeling with the viewers.
</p><br><br><p>A stream of cold steam came out at Adam’s sigh, sweeping over his shoulders, then the meteor’s body collided with the needle tip.
</p><br><p>A snow-white flash illuminated the Moon Colosseum, blinding everyone for a moment. There was hardly anyone here who could see Adam’s every move.
</p><br><p>When the first spectators stopped squinting to see even a glimpse of what was happening, their eyes opened wide in disbelief.
</p><br><p>The massive meteor that should destroy the arena and bring Adam his defeat, was split into two equal parts, as if cut by a sharp blade under a precise swing.
</p><br><p>Adam who moments ago was under the meteorite, was now over it, at the end of his path.
</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.
</p><br><p>Wide cracks spread across the meteorite’s halves before shattering into dozens of pieces in a single explosion.
</p><br><br><p>A hail of cold, insignificant meteorites rained down on the arena, one after another crashing into the ground, passing through a dense layer of dust.
</p><br><p>A faint, sunlight covered Adam’s face, and his eyes shifted to the left - to the rising sun, with each round of their battle it rose higher wanting to take its rightful place at the zenith.
</p><br><p>’Agh... How beautiful. If it were up to me I’d stay here longer, but... I should be getting back by now, shouldn’t I?’
</p><br><p>Under his calm gaze, the long needle shattered into a hundred particles, white energy in multiple streams like threads passed by his face, only to disappear into the void.
</p><br><p>Smoothly and unhurriedly, Adam turned his body, doing a flip in the air like a professional trickster.
</p><br><br><p>Adam landed on one of the fallen meteorites, standing a little higher than Fromund, but it was enough to look at his opponent from top to bottom.
</p><br><p>The electrical discharges stopped, the needle shattered and his gauntlets were no longer saturated with energy from his First Order.
</p><br><p>The only thing left was his Second Order, the threads protecting and reinforcing his body, and the amber grid in his right eye remained unmoving.
</p><br><p>A single trickle of blood flowed from the corner of his mouth, reaching his chin, a crimson drop flew down, smashing against the same stone.
</p><br><br><p>No one said anything, that went for fighters and spectators alike. No one decided to disturb such an important moment, everyone was ready to wait for Adam and Fromund, one of them to mark the beginning of the next round.
</p><br><p>But... Find adventures at NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>No one held back their thoughts.
</p><br><p>Gladius smirked softly, biting down on his pinky finger with a predatory gaze.
</p><br><p>’What a unique ability... Although, Fromund’s one is also more than impressive for a K2-Phantom. That white path... with its help, Adam made Damien use his ability in their training battle.’
</p><br><p>’Fromund, his attacks are devastating and massive. I doubt that if K2W0-Phantom specializing in defense were against him, it would be enough to withstand his abilities. Hah, his Second Order literally summons a meteorite.’
</p><br><p>Then, Gladius’s gaze shifted from Adam to Fromund, who was still standing to the side, leaning on his massive sword, he had yet to make a single swing of his new weapon.
</p><br><p>’For such power, there’s always a price to pay. After all, you can’t just call down a flaming meteor and effortlessly repeat it a few more times.’
</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.
</p><br><p>With the rapid beating of his heart, it abruptly stopped for a moment, a bright pain reflected on Fromund’s face, causing his eyes to go wide.
</p><br><br><p>A powerful stream of dark blood rushed from Fromund’s mouth, flooding the ground in front of him. His stance was unstable, swaying from side to side from one foot to the other in an attempt to regain his balance.
</p><br><p>Eventually, Fromund leaned on the broad hilt of his sword, resting his hands on it.
</p><br><p>His face paled heavily, blood flying outward in new streams from time to time until Fromund’s suffering finally stopped.
</p><br><p>They both used their Second Orders, but the nature of their abilities were different as well as the amount of resources they expended for it.
</p><br><p>Adam’s Second Order wasn’t capable of killing his opponent with one successful attack, merely destroying dozens of meters of ground with a single collapse, but Fromund’s ability could.
</p><br><p>"What a pity. Such destructive attacks are more suited for hunting monsters in the Dead Lands rather than fighting in a duel."
</p><br><br><p>Jumping off the piece of meteor, Adam glanced at his hands, at the threads running down his body.
</p><br><p>’How did I not notice this before? Although... I only became like this after K2-Level.’
</p><br><p>With eyes as deep as the bottom of the ocean, Adam turned around, surveying their battlefield.
</p><br><p>’My abilities, my powers... They’re great for fights like this, especially against a single opponent.’
</p><br><p>Fromund was slowly coming to his senses. He spat out the last clot of blood and gripped the hilt of his sword tightly.
</p><br><p>’Damn it. I thought I could at least wound him, but using the Second Order was my main failure in this fight... Well, it’s not too late to remedy the situation, is it?
</p><br><p>Not about to give up, Fromund pulled his sword out of the ground, ready to show what he was capable of with such a weapon in his hands.
</p><br><p>Elva and Liv, who were watching the fight from afar, clenched their small fists tightly. They saw that after this round their brother had weakened greatly, but they knew that this was not the end.
</p><br><p>Faith in Fromund remained in the hearts of many people, but some became very nervous.
</p><br><p>Most had money at stake, large sums of money, while at the same time, some were willing to spend much more to make sure Fromund would win.
</p><br><p>Frowning heavily, Zarot muttered:
</p><br><p>"Tsk. What’s the point of having such a powerful ability if you can’t use it properly? Fuck! I don’t believe he can lose!"
</p><br><p>Although Osana couldn’t hear him, she could tell from the expression on his face.
</p><br><p>A satisfied smirk emerged from her curved lips with a predatory glint in her gaze, she was enjoying their doubts.</p>
