            <br><p>Just like ordinary humans, Phantoms needed to sleep. They were much more enduring and strong than ordinary humans so they could go several days without sleep without much trouble.</p><br><p>Sure, humans were also capable of this in emergencies, but the side effects would be of varying severity.</p><br><p>However, right now, one Phantom after another like infants were sinking into sleep. They had no spacious beds or soft pillows, just the hard walls of the fighter and the sweet, intoxicating feeling of victory.</p><br><p>They survived, it was safe now, and so they could relax.</p><br><p>Adam was no exception. Although he stood against the wall with his arms crossed over his chest, his eyes were tightly closed and his mind was immersed in inner space.</p><br><p>When he came back, all he saw around him was endless darkness. Strangely enough, it wasn't what he expected.</p><br><br><p>Seconds later, his Initial Gene shuddered as two stars flew towards him.</p><br><p>Moira and Lone Blaze presented themselves in front of him.</p><br><p>Without delay, Lone Blaze dropped to one knee, her palm headed for her chest, fingertips touching her shoulder.</p><br><p>Moira wasn't ready to show her loyalty in this way, still, she lowered her gaze in respect.</p><br><p>Adam felt strange. Unlike his opponent, the Crimson Monarch, he didn't need servants.</p><br><p>However, he had to live up to his position. Worse than a selfish and cruel master could only be a master who did not recognize the efforts and decisions of his subordinates.</p><br><p>"Lone Blaze, you can stand up. Moira, raise your head, I have a few questions for you."</p><br><p>The girls did as Adam said.</p><br><br><br><p>Adam tilted his head, looking at her intently.</p><br><p>"Moira... I want to know who you are?"</p><br><p>Moira flinched, stumped.</p><br><p>"W-What, what do you mean?"</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand, his gaze remaining.</p><br><p>"I originally thought you were part of the Kyros, something like a tail, but you turned out to be a separate creature. So... Are you a monster? An artifact? An ability? What are you?"</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Moira's frightened expression disappeared, she understood the gist of his question, and she had an answer:</p><br><p>"The first one, I'm a monster." Moira clenched her fists tightly, her gaze full of confidence, then she looked away, "Though... I should have died years ago."</p><br><p>Adam and Lone Blaze glanced over. Moira's voice was unusually somber and adult. Then, he remembered that the Crimson Monarch hadn't been born in the blood pond, he had only awakened from sleep and Moira was already with him.</p><br><p>He didn't know how old the Crimson Monarch was, but Adam realized that Kyros was older than him, and...'</p><br><p>'Something tells me that this girl in front of me has been in this world a lot longer than I have.' Adam thought, watching Moira's emotions.</p><br><p>Then, he tilted his head.</p><br><p>"What do you mean? Did someone attack you? Kyros saved you?"</p><br><p>Moira nodded slightly, pressing her hand to her chest as if wanting to keep that memory forever.</p><br><p>"Yes, when I was still a weak monster, I lost one of my first battles. A few minutes before I was supposed to die, Kyros found me."</p><br><p>Biting her lip she continued:</p><br><p>"I was ready for him to finish me off and devour me. That's what any of the monsters would do in his place, and... in the beginning, Kyros was about to fulfill my fears. I remember him putting his hand over my head, one move, and I would be dead."</p><br><br><p>"When he saw that I wasn't resisting and was about to die of horrible wounds, he looked forward and planned to walk away, leaving me to my doom. I'll be honest, at that moment I was enraged. I mean, pity in that situation was a hundred times worse than if he had brutally finished me off. I felt my life wasn't worth his attention."</p><br><p>Listening to her carefully, Adam nodded deeply. If he were in Moira's position he would've felt the same way.</p><br><p>"So... Knowing I had nothing to lose, I sank my fangs into his ankle as hard as I could. I wanted him to abruptly turn around and destroy me in the next second, but... instead, he only smiled wryly."</p><br><p>Soon, a happy smile lit up Moira's face, those memories were heartwarming to her.</p><br><p>"He said he liked that I hadn't given up yet, though I just wanted him to regret his arrogance."</p><br><p>Moira looked off into the distance as if wanting to see the Crimson Monarch's reflection in the darkness.</p><br><p>"We both realized that saving me was impossible, so he offered to absorb me, because my energy, my essence was still intact, unlike my body. He said he was willing to make me a partner, that he liked my will, hah... what a fool."</p><br><p>The smile lingered on her face for a while, remembering the past, then she turned to Adam.</p><br><p>"Basically, Kyros did the same thing to me that you did. He let me into his space, sacrificed a part of himself so I could move on and live."</p><br><p>No emotion was reflected on Adam's face, but his mind wasn't so unconcerned, a multitude of questions raging.</p><br><p>'What? Did The Crimson Monarch know how to talk back then? What was his level of power? Maybe I'm taking Moira's words too literally?'</p><br><p>Realizing that he wanted to know something else now, Adam shook his head leaving only one question:</p><br><p>"So you were a monster, but Kyros absorbed you so you wouldn't die? Is that the only way a monster can get an ally like you?"</p><br><p>"No." Moira quickly replied, "Your assumption about the artifact is also real. There are monsters that have a partner like Kyros had, only if I was a monster, in their case it was an artifact."</p><br><p>This time, Adam turned to Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Don't tell me monsters can absorb External Artifacts. I mean, the very essence of the artifacts themselves, not just the energy."</p><br><br><p>Lone Blaze nodded deeply; she pointed at Adam.</p><br><p>"Phantoms use artifacts, monsters can absorb artifacts as well."</p><br><p>Adam nodded, the consequences of monsters consuming an artifact resulted in the appearance of an Essence Type.</p><br><p>Then, Lone Blaze pointed to herself.</p><br><p>"The same thing happens with External Artifacts, but at a higher level. It's quite possible if the Crimson Monarch didn't have an ally - Moira, then he could capture me if he wanted to."</p><br><br><p>"However, unlike Phantoms, monsters can absorb energy from External Artifact for their evolution. That would just kill me, the monster would use me as a consumable."</p><br><p>With a thoughtful look, Adam scratched his chin.</p><br><p>"If the first option happened. Would you go along with it?"</p><br><p>"No, without the Pact, there's no way to make the connection. Now, I serve you, but I'm proud, I'd rather blow myself up with an insolent monster than agree to humiliating and undignified terms."</p><br><p>Adam answered nothing, he heard enough.</p><br><p>'Hmm... When a monster absorbs an artifact it becomes the Essence Type. The Overlord Type is a mixed Crown and Conqueror Types. What happens to the monster that absorbed the essence of the External Artifact? Does the Essence Type or Prime Type have any continuation?'</p><br><p>Silence fell for a few minutes, Moira and Lone Blaze not, disturbing Adam's pondering.</p><br><p>Soon, he sighed heavily and met Moira's gaze.</p><br><p>"I understand, thank you for responding. Your story proved enlightening."</p><br><br><p>"You are dismissed."</p><br><p>Moira and Lone Blaze glanced over before turning into stars, finding themselves in Initial Gene.</p><br><p>Adam was about to exit his inner space, but a thought made him linger.</p><br><p>He couldn't shake the feeling that Moira was hiding something, as if one important detail was neatly buried in her story. He was sure it had to do with Moira's role in her alliance with the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>But... he didn't know what exactly he was looking for.</p>
