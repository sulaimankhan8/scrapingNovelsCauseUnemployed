            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1153: Storm and She</strong></p><br><p>When Adam first became a K4-Phantom, he had a long conversation with Wilfred. Among many important things, Adam also learned that he was now at the bottom of the food chain, which was humiliating for him.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, this was not entirely true.</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam was not the weakest. No, he was the strongest among the weakest. He had not yet fully embarked on the path of the K4-Phantom, but that was no longer the case.</p><br><p>Now, when Adam revealed the Path Construct and chose the first star of his initial constellation, he crossed the line. Adam became the weakest among the strongest and was the bearer of a unique energy that no other Phantom possessed.</p><br><p>Neither Silvana nor Adam knew this, but there were enough monsters and anomalies near the Corrosive Lakes that could spot him and attack at any moment to capture him.</p><br><p>This did not happen because earlier, it made no sense.</p><br><p>Even a Lord, not to mention the Black Threat Monsters, anomalies, or External Artifacts, was unable to absorb the energy of the Path Construct from Adam until he revealed it. But now that he had chosen the first star and opened the Path Construct, everything had changed.</p><br><p>The energy inside it attracted all creatures that could reach it.</p><br><p>Sure, it was still not at the level of the Lords, let alone someone like Kenward or Saegar, but the fact was that now Adam was not the only one hunting. Other monsters were doing the same, and many of them could be much stronger than him.</p><br><p>The reason for this was that the constellation, its stars, and the Path Construct carried the energy of the First Star or the Last Star in a compressed state, because the Phantom’s energy was also part of it.</p><br><p>This was not unique to Adam, it happened to every K4-Phantom who reached this stage and revealed the Path Construct.</p><br><p>However, Adam was in greater danger than many other K4-Phantoms, and as always, the reason for this was his actions and their consequences.</p><br><p>The enemies Adam fought, the risks he took, and the choices he made all ultimately led him to the Dark Shore, where he was absorbed by the Twilight Crystal before he had reached his full power.</p><br><p>Only a small number of Phantoms had both the active energy of the Last Star and the First Star in their bodies.</p><br><p>Naturally, for monsters born from the intertwining of two types of energy, Adam was the primary target.</p><br><p>If a monster that cannot break through the barrier has the choice between killing nine K4-Phantoms or killing Adam, then in a hundred cases out of a hundred, the choice will fall on Adam.</p><br><p>Unfortunately for Adam, he did not yet understand this.</p><br><p>Douglas, Wilfred, and the others could have warned him because they knew about the situation, but first, he had to open the Path Construct for this conversation to take place.</p><br><br><p>Adam got up, dusting the dirt off his knees. He had defeated Lyrod, but the battle had taken a lot out of him, even with the effects of the dark crown and the white heart.</p><br><p>“Alright, it’s time to go home, right? When will the fighter jet come for me?” Adam asked as he glanced over his shoulder. “It’ll take too long to walk to the spire!”</p><br><p>Silvana nodded weakly.</p><br><p>“Sure, I’m already on it. I think we can pick you up in about…”</p><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana fell silent for no apparent reason.</p><br><p>“Hmm? Something wrong?”</p><br><p>Silvana’s eyes widened in horror.</p><br><br><br><p>Confused, Adam turned around.</p><br><p>A few seconds ago, there was nothing on the horizon, but now a menacing storm of darkness was heading his way. Amidst the whirlwind, he could see many red eyes waiting for them to reach Adam so they could attack him all at once.</p><br><p>Amidst the storm, two shadows were also visible, clearly competing with each other and trying to reach Adam faster than the rest.</p><br><br><p>Even from this distance, he could feel how powerful their auras were. He didn’t stand a chance against any of these monsters.</p><br><p>Sure, the storm wasn’t a monster, some External Artifact controlled it, but its destructive power was enough to tear Adam to pieces, not to mention the monsters controlled by the artifact.</p><br><p>“What the hell is this, Silvana?”</p><br><p>Silvana’s face turned pale in an instant. She had no backup plan for this. The monsters in the distance weren’t Lords, but they were definitely not Adam’s level, especially after his tough fight against Lyrod.</p><br><p>‘This… Adam, please run!’</p><br><p>It didn’t take much convincing for Adam to take off as fast as he could, looking back from time to time.</p><br><p>To his horror, he could see that with every second that passed, his pursuers were getting closer and closer. Their desire to get rid of each other was strong, but not strong enough to lose Adam in the process.</p><br><p>“Fuck! I’m not going to make it! I’m too slow!”</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Damien, who was watching from the Citadel, took his phone out of his pocket and dialed a number that only a few people in the Citadel knew.</p><br><p>Soon, an annoyed female voice came from the other end.</p><br><p>“What do you want, you insolent bastard?! I’m busy!”</p><br><p>“Hi, Frida!” Damien replied with a broad smile, talking to her as if she were his best friend. “I have a favor to ask you.”</p><br><p>“What? Ask someone else!”</p><br><br><p>“Hey, Phantom’s life depends on it, a stellar one.”</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Frida’s mood changed.</p><br><p>“You should have said so right away! Tell me what’s going on!”</p><br><p>“Well, you see…” Damien leaned over, watching Adam run away. “Adam Vinter, the Corrosive Lakes, could use your help. I’m sure your Operator will know everything in a few seconds.”</p><br><p>“What? That guy? Isn’t he your favorite? You know I don’t like that young man! He’s as crazy as you are!” Frida’s shout rang out like thunder.</p><br><p>Damien shrugged carelessly.</p><br><p>“Come on, that was a long time ago, especially for him, for whom a year still means something. He’s a stellar Phantom, we don’t have many of them in this World Wipe.”</p><br><p>Frida clenched her teeth.</p><br><p>“Are you going to help me or not?”</p><br><p>Then, she sighed heavily and rolled her eyes.</p><br><p>“Fine, just get the fuck away from me!”</p><br><br><p>At the same time, with less than ten seconds left before the whirlwind and monsters reached Adam, a shadow fell over him.</p><br><br><p>Under Adam’s shocked gaze, a great spear crashed down on the storm and monsters, reducing them to nothing, along with hundreds of meters of land.</p>
