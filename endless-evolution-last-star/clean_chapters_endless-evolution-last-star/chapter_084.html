            <br><p>Mirna, in a short period, used her entire arsenal, to finish off Adam. It was her only goal, especially after what had happened. For that, she was willing to sacrifice everything she had, and her Second Nexus Trait was the final step.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The sound waves made the air shake, bringing the powerful vibrations down on Adam. Unlike Mirna's scream, these waves were much stronger, designed to shatter their target into pieces rather than simply destabilize.</p><br><p>"ARGHHHHHHH!!!" Adam screamed in pain as small wounds opened up all over his body. It felt like his body was being torn apart, though that wasn't wrong.</p><br><p>The worst part was that Adam couldn't do anything, literally. Due to the dizziness and extreme headache, he couldn't think of anything except trying to cover his ears. Against something like this, classical music was clearly not enough.</p><br><p>Even Silvana's voice was completely muffled, even though the earbud was right in his ear, but the sound waves penetrated much deeper, filling the entire space.</p><br><p>'Think... Think, Think! I have to do something or I'm just going to blow up like a balloon soon!' Adam exclaimed, making an effort to focus. His mind quickly raced through everything he had, but no plan came up.</p><br><p>Then, amidst the darkness in his mind, a single silver thread ran through - like a clue that his subconscious was guiding him. His eyes focused on his gloves, or rather, on threads stretched like strings.</p><br><p>'Right... Not without consequences, but I can use my First Nexus Trait once more. A second, just a second of peace and quiet, that's all I need...' Adam muttered to himself before turning his wrists and slamming the threads against each other.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Soul Cry spread outward, creating a buffer zone around Adam where his sound collided with the sound waves of the columns.</p><br><p>The power of his ability was much weaker than four columns from Second Trait, but Adam got what he wanted - a second's silence.</p><br><p>Without wasting even a moment, Adam rushed forward, quickly exiting the area of columns and finding himself right in front of Mirna.</p><br><p>Unlike Adam, who had a short break after defeating Prime King, Mirna used all her abilities in a few minutes. Her body was under a lot of stress time after time, especially after she used the First and Second Nexus Trait.</p><br><p>Normally, this was the maximum, because one could not endure activating the Nexus three times in a row - it would cause her heart to burst.</p><br><p>However, now Mirna had no other option. She was too weak to fight Adam. Even if she blocked his attack, he would just knock the halberd out of her hands.</p><br><p>Mirna opened her mouth wide as her eyes flashed. A horrible scream was about to erupt at any second.</p><br><br><p>The needle stabbed into her neck, severing her vocal cords and coming out the other side with a bloody tip.</p><br><p>Mirna's gaze lowered, staring at the silver needle in disbelief and realizing what had happened.</p><br><p>"I... Don't... do..." Mirna wheezed with difficulty, barely able to be understood if one didn't keep listening.</p><br><p>"I don't know what you want to say, but words don't matter, only actions, and you've already done enough." Adam said coldly, swinging the needle with all his might and ripping Mirna's head off.</p><br><p>Adam shook his head, took a deep breath, and turned around. He didn't have time to deal with his thoughts, he had to make sure the others were okay first.</p><br><p>However, his eyes went wide and a chill ran down his back as he quickly headed towards them, though... He couldn't change anything anymore.</p><br><br><p>"Alright! I've got your back! Let's go! All we have to do is catch up to him!" Sirgus exclaimed, running forward with his shield displayed in front of him. His shield was covered in a dense layer of stone - his Nexus Trait, with this he could not be afraid of silver bullets. </p><br><p>Up ahead, a few dozen meters away, was the last Phantom of this squad. It was a gunslinger, wearing black and red armor and short silver hair. In his hands was his Nexus, a massive sniper rifle.</p><br><p>He had been hit in the leg by Mark's arrow, just like Mark, who was lying against the sand wall. The silver bullet had pierced his shoulder, making it impossible for him to archery until he fully recovered.</p><br><p>Katrin, after what she had done in the sand temple, could barely move, so now it was up to Sirgus and Kody. Well, silverhead was injured, and Sirgus had a decent defense, so their victory was only a matter of time.</p><br><p>"Stay right behind me. Don't let him aim for your head!" Sirgus said seriously when the distance between them and the gunslinger shortened.</p><br><p>"Sure." Kody nodded, moving right behind Sirgus like a stone wall.</p><br><p>The gunslinger's eyes changed, his gaze going blank as he realized that this was the end for him. However, Sirgus couldn't see it, he was too focused on the rifle.</p><br><p>Then, the silverhead took a deep breath, and his eyes sparkled. The rifle's muzzle shone brightly, and with a fiery burst, a bronze bullet flew out.</p><br><p>Sirgus's eyes went wide as he used Order, summoning a stone wall and tightly holding a shield.</p><br><p>Whoooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>The bronze bullet passed through all obstacles with ease, ending up right in Sirgus's chest.</p><br><p>Sirgus stopped abruptly as Kody crashed into him, who didn't understand why Sirgus hadn't moved.</p><br><p>"Hey, we're almost there!" Kody said irritably.</p><br><p>Sirgus looked at his chest, which occasionally flashed with a bright light. A bitter smile and an accepting look appeared on his face.</p><br><p>'Well, at least I'll die with a team instead of alone surrounded by monsters...' Sirgus inwardly muttered before turning around and pushing Kody as far away from him as possible.</p><br><p>Kody's eyes went wide, full of incomprehension, but soon, an unsettling feeling filled his mind due to Sirgus's slight smile. It was a farewell that replaced any words.</p><br><p>The bullet exploded, tearing Sirgus apart, his arms, legs, and shield flying off in different directions, instantly removing him from the history of this world.</p><br><p>Katrin and Mark's faces went pale. They didn't want to believe it happened.</p><br><p>Kody, on the other hand... Well, his sword burst into red flames as he charged at the gunslinger like a wild beast with the sole desire for revenge.</p><br><p>The red blade sliced the rifle apart, and a few more swings left several bloody cuts on the gunslinger's body, clearly painful.</p><br><p>Then, Kody cut off the gunslinger's arm, pinned him to the ground, and with a ferocious look, clenched his sword tightly, about to pierce the gunslinger's head.</p><br><p>'Wait!' Silvana's voice echoed in Kody's earbud, 'We have to find out what they were doing here! We have to question him! Don't kill him, at least not yet!'</p><br><p>"Argh!!!" Kody roared, bringing his sword down.</p><br><p>The blade was stabbed into the ground, right next to the gunslinger's face, burning his skin, but leaving him alive.</p><br><p>At this time, Adam and Mark were running up to Kody, while Katrin... she slowly walked towards them with a blank stare.</p><br><p>She snapped her earbud, not wanting to listen to this anymore, and gripped her staff tightly.</p>
