            <br><p>"What...? Is this really that dangerous a place?" Adam asked in disbelief.</p><br><p>He didn't mean to sound arrogant or cocky, but he thought that within the Citadel, he was quite strong.</p><br><p>After all, he was a Naturalborn K1-Phantom. It was still one of the beginning stages, but he had already come a long way and had become considerably stronger.</p><br><p>Damien nodded slightly.</p><br><p>"For you, yes. I mean, in the Lower Ring, for decades, ordinary people have been living there and doing their stuff. There wouldn't be a problem if you were a simple guest. However, once you start learning more about Ruby Drew and the situation in the Lower Ring, you're bound to get into trouble soon."</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a deep gaze.</p><br><p>However, he wasn't upset, because it just meant he needed to get a little stronger. Regardless of his plans in the Lower Ring, that was one of his main goals.</p><br><p>"Well, in that case, I should follow my plan. After this mission, I was going to hunt for the Essence Monster, looks like it's the right time."</p><br><br><p>"Oh, you want to upgrade the artifact, right? Right choice, it's better to gradually grow your power than to constantly change it like toys."</p><br><p>Then, Damien's gaze became more serious, which was even slightly frightening.</p><br><p>"However... I wouldn't do that right now if I were you."</p><br><p>"Hm? Why?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>"It's simple. You're going to die." Damien said nonchalantly.</p><br><p>There was no threat or mockery in his voice, and it wasn't an assumption. Damien spoke as if it were a fact, as simple and unyielding as an axiom in math. It was scary to the core.</p><br><p>"But... Why? I've already gone through many dangerous battles before. I'm sure it will be difficult this time, but not so much that I'll die! Brass Puppet and the Steel Knight were indeed a deadly threat! I'm sure Essence Monsters were not ranked higher than Crown Type!" Adam exclaimed, slightly indignant.</p><br><p>He believed that Damien had underestimated him. It was entirely possible since their strength levels were drastically different.</p><br><p>However, Damien was not prejudiced. In fact, he was even slightly optimistic due to his temperament.</p><br><p>"Well... There are two factors involved. Let's start with the simple one - the danger of the Essence Monsters." Damien said with a slight smile. He wanted to continue, but seeing Beth's bored face, he changed his mind.</p><br><p>"Alright, I'm going to get myself something to drink and grab you guys one as well." Damien stood up abruptly, heading for the kitchen, "Beth, tell him about Essence Type. It'll be good for Silvana, too."</p><br><p>Beth's eyes went wide, then her gaze lit up as if she finally had a chance to engage in her favorite thing - explaining.</p><br><p>"Alright! Then let's get down to work!" Beth exclaimed vigorously, pulling out a tablet and calling up a multitude of holograms.</p><br><p>For the next ten minutes, Adam had to absorb more information than he was ready for.</p><br><p>Damien deliberately stayed late, for he knew Beth would give all the details. Once, he had gone through this.</p><br><p>In any Operator-Phantom pairing, the Operator was the brain and the Phantom the muscle. Sure, that didn't mean the Phantoms were dumb, but no Phantom knew as much data as the Operator, and no Operator had as much combat experience as the Phantoms.</p><br><p>Each had their weaknesses and strengths. The important thing was to understand that and use it for good, for the common goal.</p><br><p>"I see... Fuck, looks like I was overconfident..." Adam muttered towards the end of Beth's explanation.</p><br><p>What was most important to Adam was the main difference between Essence Type and other monsters.</p><br><p>If Prime Type were some golden midpoint of a particular species, and Crown Type was the true peak in battle mastery, then Essence Type concentrated on one area - firepower.</p><br><p>'Essence Type are like mages in the world of knights - they possess destructive power thanks to the abnormal energy from the absorbed artifact.' Beth's words once again echoed through Adam's mind.</p><br><p>Adam, during his battles with Prime Stone Goliath, Brass Puppet, or Steel Knight, had been wounded repeatedly, but thanks to his instincts and the toughness of his body, he was able to keep fighting. The wounds were numerous but not fatal.</p><br><p>However, against Essence Type, Adam wouldn't be able to act as risky. The reason was simple - if he missed one direct attack, he would be turned into dust by the enormous energy possessed by Essence Monsters.</p><br><p>That meant that Adam needed to change his fighting style which he had already gotten used to. He should act in a more disciplined and tactical manner.</p><br><p>"Alright, stop thinking about it." Damien broke into their conversation, jolting Adam out of the thoughts he was sinking deeper into.</p><br><p>Adam came to his senses as he saw the red can of soda in front of him - he couldn't have asked for better.</p><br><p>"Fine, I think Essence Type makes sense to you now. However, the reason why you will die if you go to fight Essence Type now is - you!" Damien vigorously said, pointing at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam got a confused look.</p><br><p>"Me...? I mean, you're saying it's because of a lack of skill? I'm ready to fix it and prepare myself properly for a battle with Essence Type." Adam said confidently. He wasn't afraid of obstacles, but he didn't act like he was omnipotent either.</p><br><p>Every problem needed a different approach, he had learned that long ago while living in the slums.</p><br><p>Damien shook his head with a bitter smile.</p><br><p>"Nah, it's not about your skills. Saying that the reason is you, that's exactly what I intended with no hidden meaning. Look, I'm about to tell you something that only Second Rank Phantoms know, so listen carefully."</p><br><p>Beth rolled her eyes.</p><br><p>"You know you're not supposed to do that, right?" Beth crossed her arms over her chest with a judgmental stare.</p><br><br><p>"Well, if Adam wasn't Naturalborn Phantom then I wouldn't bring it up, but it's important. His life could depend on it, so consider me taking steps to save him. Once again." Damien grinned.</p><br><p>Then, he sat down across from Adam and put his fingertips to each other.</p><br><p>"Adam, tell me, do you consider yourself a lucky person or, conversely, an unlucky one?" Damien's mouth corners raised.</p><br><p>Adam was caught off guard by such a strange question, but he decided to answer:</p><br><p>"Neither. I think I'm somewhere in the middle, like most people. I've had both bad and good things happen to me, doesn't time equate everything to the same value?"</p><br><p>"Hehehe." Damien chuckled evilly, "You're wrong, because you are, simultaneously more lucky and unlucky than others. More precisely, you are such compared to Artificialborn Phantoms and especially ordinary people since you're a Naturalborn Phantom."</p><br><p>"What...? What are you talking about?" Adam muttered in a trembling voice as his heart began to beat faster.</p><br><p>"Naturalborn Phantoms naturally attract bad luck and good luck to them. Not in all aspects, it won't make you win or lose more often at the casino, but in Dead Lands, where there are a lot of monsters, it definitely has an effect. The monsters sense your powerful genes, your full Evolution Tree, and a solid Initial Gene."</p><br><p>Damien raised his chin as he narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>"To make it finally clear to you - if you were an Artificalborn Phantom, it's unlikely that your Beginning Monster would be a Crown Type, and it's unlikely that a Steel Knight would follow you."</p><br><p>"Thus, when hunting an Essence Monster, you'll have bad luck - the monster will be strong as hell - and unknown luck!"</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, and a chill ran down his back while fragments of memories of all his fights flashed through his mind.</p>
