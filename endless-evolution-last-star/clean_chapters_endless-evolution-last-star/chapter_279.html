            <br><p>Adam didn't have the goal of meeting or killing every monster of the Top-10, at Purple Threat Level, but by following the sequence of events he had already met almost every one of the strongest monsters.</p><br><p>However, the two monsters from the Top-10 were still a mystery to him. Or rather... that was the case until now.</p><br><p>Now that Adam had seen the Top-8 monster, Scarlet Pyromancer, albeit as a hologram, there was only one monster that Adam knew nothing about - Top-1.</p><br><p>Sure, he could find out a lot about Top-1 if he wanted to, Adam could ask Silvana to tell him or he could go to the mission department database himself.</p><br><p>However, Adam simply didn't have that need. He couldn't focus his attention only on this target, for there were other, more important tasks at all times.</p><br><p>"Essence Scarlet Pyromancer..." Adam muttered looking at the hologram of the huge monster.</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer was a massive beetle with dark red armor and a longhorn covered in streams of flame. Its four eyes were hidden beneath protective plates as were its broad wings, held back by thick, impenetrable armor.</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer had six paws, each with unusual petals that emitted particles of flame. If desired, Scarlet Pyromancer could create as much fire and concentration as he wanted.</p><br><p>Unlike most monsters, Scarlet Pyromancer didn't have a powerful jaw, but it had two fat glands near its mouth that shone brightly as if they contained lava inside.</p><br><p>"Now this is the first time I've seen this monster, but from the looks of it, like all Essence Monsters, it has enormous firepower." Adam concluded, casting a glance at Katrin to make sure of his theory.</p><br><p>Katrin smirked contentedly, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><br><p>"Exactly. It's a perfect match! Among the Top-10 of the Purple Threat Level, there are only two Essence Monsters." Katrin said, looking at the hologram with sparkling eyes, "Thunder Demon is too strong, but... Scarlet Pyromancer is a great option."</p><br><p>Then, Katrin clenched her fist with a great frown.</p><br><p>"I'm sick of helping everyone.</p><br><p>I'm sick of my powers. I'm sick of these roots and everything to do with wood and healing!" Katrin snorted irritably, "I want to kill and burn! I will force others to help me and lead them on the path of victory, shining brightly with my flame!"</p><br><p>Adam with a slight smile on his face, silently listened to Katrin's fiery speech.</p><br><p>He couldn't fully understand her feelings, but Adam knew that Katrin was power-hungry. She wanted to be a leader, a light to others, but her Initial Gene was constantly holding her back.</p><br><p>"I see. In that case, the flame monster is a really good option. However, if you want me to help you, you'll have to tell me the process. I don't know how it all works." Adam said with a slight wave of his hand.</p><br><p>Adam didn't want to argue with Katrin, but he didn't even realize how it was possible. More specifically, Adam didn't expect that it was possible to replace one's Initial Gene with the gene of a monster as powerful as Scarlet Pyromancer.</p><br><p>Most Phantoms got their Initial Gene from White Threat Level monsters, in rare cases it was a Green Threat Level monster.</p><br><p>This was usually the case with Naturalborn Phantoms, as the government and military only prepared White Threat Level monsters for new Phantoms. It was too dangerous for both the military and the rookie Phantom to contain the stronger monsters.</p><br><br><p>"Sure. As you know, the Initial Gene is the center of everything. Without the Initial Gene, there would be no Evolution Tree, no abilities, no Nexus, or even artifacts, because our bodies wouldn't be able to receive them without power." Katrin proceeded to explain.</p><br><p>Adam listened to her intently. He would be sure to ask Silvana about it again, but Katrin's story was more useful, for she was about to go through this and thus she was already prepared.</p><br><p>"Obviously, something as powerful as the Initial Gene can't just be replaced like a puzzle in a painting or a gear in a watch. Adam, do you know what would happen if Phantom lost his Initial Gene?" Katrin asked with a serious expression.</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head, puzzled. It was clear from his blank stare that he'd never really pondered it.</p><br><p>"Agh. Just as I thought." Katrin shook her head, "Look, there are only two ways to lose your Initial Gene." Katrin said pointing two fingers.</p><br><p>"First: Phantom wanted it himself and removed his Initial Gene. Second: In rare cases due to an overload of energy. This can happen either due to the wrong artifact or in trying to take too much damage. However, this is extremely rare, as Phantom will die much faster than his Initial Gene overloading due to some incident."</p><br><br><p>"And...? What happens if Phantom loses his Initial Gene?"</p><br><p>Katrin's gaze deepened.</p><br><p>"In the second option, the Initial Gene will explode due to an overload of energy. Naturally, the same thing would happen to Phantom and his body. An explosion of such power would destroy everything around it, leaving no chance of survival not only for Phantom but for every living creature in the vicinity."</p><br><p>Adam's gaze headed downward, becoming much deeper. It was quite possibly the worst death for Phantom, for there was nobody left and Phantom could kill his mates with his death.</p><br><p>Sure, it was very rare and needed special conditions to happen, but Citadel had seen enough of these precedents.</p><br><p>"But... I guess it's not so bad in the first option, since that's what you're going to do, isn't it?" Adam suggested, looking intently at Katrin.</p><br><br><p>"Like I have a choice. If Phantom removes his Initial Gene, it literally starts the countdown to Phantom's death." Katrin smirked, but her smile was bitter and heavy.</p><br><p>"Without the Initial Gene, the Evolution Tree will start releasing all the energy outward. And... The most important thing here is to hit the timings." Katrin muttered.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam tilted his head in confusion, "Timings?"</p><br><br><p>"Each Phantom has a different timing, but on average, death by exhaustion occurs seven minutes after losing the Initial Gene. But, those seven minutes don't go the same way. In the first five minutes, you're not just at the peak of your powers, because of the massive amount of energy leaving the Evolution Tree, it's like you're constantly in a state of Resonance."</p><br><p>"I see... Thanks to that, you take one step forward. In that case, if you enter Resonance, you can reach an impossible level, like a self-sacrifice spell." Adam suggested.</p><br><p>Katrin nodded as she continued:</p><br><p>"When the five minutes are up, meaning Evolution Tree is almost empty, the Phantom's power will be greatly reduced. If that were to happen to you, you would return to K0-level in strength. And... After a minute and fifty seconds, the last ten seconds of these seven minutes will begin."</p><br><p>Adam listened to Katrin's every word with interest. .net</p><br><p>She clenched her fists tightly, preparing to speak:</p><br><p>"By this point, there will be no more energy left in the Evolution Tree and then it will begin to drain the life force from the Phantom's body in an attempt to fill the void. Then, Phantom dies."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, looked up for a while, and then shifted his gaze to Katrin.</p><br><p>"I see... so best to get everything done in the first five minutes."</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, but that's not all. I've told you how the process of removing the old Initial Gene is done. However, there are conditions that need to be met to be able to get and insert the new Initial Gene. Listen to me carefully."</p>
