            <br><p>Silvana stared intently at Dahla, who was calmly approaching Adam.</p><br><p>Adam tried to get up from the ground, but was dizzy and his eyes were blurred. It would take some time for Adam to regain consciousness.</p><br><p>"Mr. Douglas... This girl, Dahla, who is she?"</p><br><p>Douglas glanced at Silvana, keeping his arms crossed on his powerful chest.</p><br><p>"Hmm, like Damien said, she's a K4-Phantom, but I wouldn't address her as a girl if I were you."</p><br><p>Silvana tilted her head in confusion.</p><br><p>"Wait... Is she a guy?"</p><br><p>Douglas gave her a baffled look, then...</p><br><p>"Hahahahahahahahaha!!!"</p><br><p>The room was filled with powerful laughter coming from his heart.</p><br><p>"Damn, youngsters, you always surprise me. No, Dahla is not a guy, that's not what I meant. Agh, I haven't laughed like that in a long time." Douglas took a few deep breaths trying to calm down.</p><br><p>Silvana puffed up her cheeks, now she felt awkward.</p><br><p>'Shit, why did I even keep holding it in the first place?' Silvana thought looking down at the strawberry milkshake.</p><br><p>Douglas pointed at Dahla.</p><br><p>"I mean she's a lot older than you, you're a girl, but here she is a woman, experienced, and has seen a lot in this life." Douglas said, then his voice got lower, "Of both worlds."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes grew wider for a moment.</p><br><p>"Of both worlds? What do you mean?"</p><br><p>Douglas's gaze became more serious.</p><br><p>"Like Adam, Dahla is a Natural Phantom, but unlike Adam, she didn't become a Phantom at a young age." Douglas explained.</p><br><p>Silvana didn't interrupt him, she had already realized that Dahla was an unusual person. However, being a K4-Phantom was already a genuine accomplishment in itself, regardless of whether there were any other specifics.</p><br><p>"She, like most people failed all the tests, she didn't get the Spark and she didn't become a Phantom. Though, she didn't count on it since she set her sights on being a doctor and getting a medical degree since she was a kid." Douglas shrugged.</p><br><p>Then, his gaze settled on Dahla who stopped in front of Adam, assessing his situation.</p><br><p>"And she succeeded. As a doctor, or rather a surgeon, she was talented and destined for a decent career, but one day everything changed."</p><br><br><p>"I see, when she became a Phantom, right?"</p><br><p>Douglas scratched the back of his head.</p><br><p>"Yeah, it's been years since that day. Even if Phantom is talented and manages to survive, it takes a long time to become a K4-Phantom. It can't be done in a month or a year." Douglas explained.</p><br><p>Unlike Artificial Phantoms, a person could become a Natural Phantom at any age since Spark and energy appeared after killing a monster.</p><br><p>This could lead to the appearance of Phantoms that already possessed skills in some fields whether it be medicine, engineering, or cooking. Sure, this was rare and usually by mysterious coincidence.</p><br><p>In fact, Adam had already met one such Phantom - Zakira, the chef at Red Feast. She was a Natural Phantom with culinary skills.</p><br><p>Usually, such Phantoms would try to find genes from those monsters that would give them abilities similar to the skills they gained over the years in their profession.</p><br><p>And... Dahla was no exception.</p><br><p>"Hmph, Mr. Damien, you've provided me with a bit more work this time." Dahla said calmly looking at Adam's teeth and his eye lying on the ground.</p><br><p>Damien just shrugged his shoulders. He wasn't going to hold back when he was fighting with restraints, though... even so he wasn't showing all he was capable of.</p><br><br><p>Dahla's amber eyes sparkled when golden energy coated her delicate hands.</p><br><p>Then, she pushed Adam lightly in the shoulder, knocking him to the ground.</p><br><p>"Please don't try to get up while I'm treating you. Lie on your back and breathe, that way I can do my job quickly and efficiently." Dahla uttered with an emotionless face.</p><br><p>"Agh!" Adam gasped when his back touched the hard floor. He felt both pain and relief.</p><br><p>Dahla nodded, bent down, and picked Adam's eye off the ground before simply sliding it into place like a puzzle piece in a mechanism.</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, Dahla gripped his jaw firmly, forcing his mouth wide open.</p><br><p>Assessing the situation, with a deft movement of her hand, Dahla slid Adam's teeth into place, simply digging their sharp tips into the flesh.</p><br><p>Sure, it was impossible to heal Adam's wounds this way, but Dahla did it to make him recover faster, nothing more.</p><br><p>"Good, you'll be fine now." Dahla nodded before placing her palms against each other.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A slight shiver went through the air as an amber sphere appeared around Dahla. It was different from the star that she summoned earlier, the sphere was smaller but also much more solid, its surface covered with pentagons like bee honeycombs.</p><br><p>Part of the bright light fell on Adam like large snowflakes, gradually covering his entire body.</p><br><p>After less than ten seconds, Dahla nodded and parted her palms before taking a few steps back.</p><br><p>The amber sphere shattered, breaking into shards that soon disappeared without a trace.</p><br><p>Adam opened his eyes, no longer feeling dizzy and the metallic taste of blood filling his mouth. There was no more pain, instead, a desired relief flowed through his body with power.</p><br><p>Dahla didn't make him stronger, she simply healed all his wounds, returning Adam to his peak state when he could show everything he was capable of.</p><br><p>"I've done my job. I'm going back to the spectator room." Dahla said serenely as if this was a routine task for her.</p><br><p>Damien nodded with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>The mechanical doors closed as Adam stood on the ground, once again marveling at Dahla's abilities. It seemed she could bring even the dead back to life if she wished.</p><br><p>"How does it feel?" Damien asked in a kind voice.</p><br><p>Earlier, he caused Adam serious wounds, but he didn't bear any anger or hatred towards Adam. It was part of their friendly sparring that was tougher than Adam and Silvana had expected.</p><br><p>Adam took a deep breath.</p><br><p>"2-0, right?" Adam looked at Damien, his eyes calm.</p><br><p>Damien shrugged nonchalantly, he couldn't deny that Adam had lost twice already.</p><br><p>"And you're still wearing your hat. Well, it looks like you're right. I actually should have used it earlier, I'm just nervous..." Adam whispered.</p><br><p>"Hmm? You're nervous?" Damien was surprised to hear something like that from Adam.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah... I've often thought about it. Needle and thread have always been my faithful companions, my weapons and tools. But... it seems only now, I got the opportunity to touch a piece of the true potential of my Initial Gene."</p><br><p>Adam plunged the needle into the ground as his eyes shone brightly and dense streams of energy once again covered his body as before, when using First and Second Orders.</p><br><p>However... now the light was much brighter and the energy was more powerful than ever.</p><br><p>Moreover, there was another difference compared to the usual Orders.</p><br><p>[You used your Initial Order - Silver Threads.]</p><br><p>Even his Evolution Tree wasn't left out, filling Adam's mind with calm but critical words for his story.</p><br><p>The ability's name was simple, but... sometimes it was the simplicity that hid all the complexity.</p><br><p>Then, everyone saw the snow-white rings appear on Adam's fingers, dozens of silver threads emanating from them, rising and swaying majestically like a natural force.</p><br><p>'Silver Weaver...' Silvana murmured, 'Right... this moment had to come at some point. Any weaver should be able to use their threads... as a weapon and as a tool to change their fate...'</p>
