            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1142: No Compromises (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>At the last moment, Adam managed to jump aside as a pale blue explosion engulfed the underground gorge. But Dayra wasn’t as quick. She was too eager to deal with Lyrod right here and now, exposing herself to the shockwave.</p><br><p>The explosion threw her aside, leaving nothing of her roots behind. Adam was also injured, but to a much lesser extent than Dayra, who was too close due to her recklessness and, to some extent, greed.</p><br><br><p>Echoing footsteps sounded from a figure emerging from the riverbed. Deftly, the figure climbed onto the bank, heading straight for Adam, who was trying to make out the silhouette through the steam mixed with dust.</p><br><p>Then, his eyes widened as he held the needle out in front of him to block the fist moving straight at him.</p><br><p>The impact threw Adam back, causing a trickle of blood to flow from the corner of his mouth, but he managed to land on his feet and maintain his fighting posture.</p><br><p>After that, Lyrod revealed himself.</p><br><p>Now, he had taken on a human form, and his turquoise eyes with round pupils looked appropriate for this image. His skin was slightly blue, and sharp stone growths remained on his wrists, like heavy bracelets. Two white horns on his head now pointed forward with their sharp tips.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, despite his great size in monster form, Lyrod looked rather thin and did not seem formidable, nor was he particularly tall. He was slightly shorter than Adam.</p><br><p>However, the cold aura surrounding him did not allow him to be mistaken for some weak monster.</p><br><p>“Phantom… I’m sure you already know my name. But what about you?” Lyrod glanced at Dayra, who had climbed out of the wall. “I hate to admit it, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to deal with you too quickly.”</p><br><p>“Hah.” Adam wiped a trickle of blood with the back of his hand. “It seems you underestimate one of your Elders too much. Although, I don’t blame you, because one of them is already dead.”</p><br><br><p>“I know. You killed him.”</p><br><p>At that moment, Dayra’s angry shout rang out from behind them:</p><br><p>“Lyrod! If you think you can defeat me quickly, you’re wrong. It was a big mistake to become your Elder, and today that will come to an end!” Dayra’s energy reached new heights, causing the ground to shake from the approaching roots.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Lyrod nodded calmly. He was very different from the monster Dayra had described as they descended to the lower floor, at least for now.</p><br><p>“Yes. You’re right about that. Today, it will all end, because you will no longer have to be my Elder.”</p><br><br><p>With a splash of water, Lyrod appeared right in front of Dayra, who didn’t have time to summon her roots. Again, she wanted to do too much and prepare a powerful attack with hundreds of roots, but a delay of a few seconds could be critical.</p><br><p>In pain, Dayra’s eyes widened as Lyrod’s fist plunged into her solar plexus.</p><br><br><p>She gasped, momentarily losing control of her body. She couldn’t even breathe. Lyrod’s blow was simple but precise and powerful enough to affect even a monster like Dayra.</p><br><p>“You see, Dayra. I didn’t need the Elders. It was an annoying condition of the crypt. You were one of the strongest, so you got the seal. But you also turned out to be one of the dumbest.”</p><br><p>Lyrod’s palm opened in front of Dayra’s face as a bright blue flash exploded.</p><br><p>The energy blast blew her head off, reducing it to nothing.</p><br><p>Then, her decapitated body collapsed to the ground right at his feet. Lyrod took one last look at Dayra’s corpse as he turned to meet Adam’s gaze.</p><br><p>It was unclear what Lyrod expected, but Adam showed virtually no reaction.</p><br><p>If it weren’t for the difficult conditions of the crypt, his alliance with Dayra would never have happened. What happened to her was her fault and her weakness.</p><br><br><p>Adam ran his hands through his hair, combing it back, as he flexed his shoulder with a distinct crack.</p><br><br><p>“Hmm?” Lyrod tilted his head.</p><br><p>“That’s my name. You asked, didn’t you?”</p><br><br><p>“Sure. I kept wondering how you dealt with Kolos so easily and managed to turn Dayra into a traitor, but… now I see it.”</p><br><p>The dark aura continued to passively emanate from Adam, constantly reminding Lyrod that he was facing the Phantom who had killed two Hollow Wave monsters possessing both consciousness and title.</p><br><p>But Lyrod did not know that this was not the only way Adam interacted with the First Star. Part of its energy was still in his inner space, preventing him from using his Foundation Artifact.</p><br><p>Sooner or later, the darkness would fall to give him the new power he deserved, not only through his evolution, but also because he managed to survive the black flash and escape from the Dark Shore.</p><br><p>“You know, you look too calm, serious, and collected.” Adam began to slowly jump in place, his anger gone as white energy wandered around his hands. “Was everything Dayra told me about you a lie?”</p><br><br><p>Lyrod shook his head as he raised his hand, creating a bright water ring behind him.</p><br><p>“You just haven’t seen my worst side, and neither has she. To be honest, I don’t think you’ll ever see it. Sooner or later, you’ll lose.”</p><br><p>“Hah, aren’t you afraid that will lead to your death? You’re relying too much on being able to prolong the fight and absorb more energy from the dark dream.”</p><br><p>Lyrod’s face showed no emotion. “Well… There are risks, but they’re small. You’ve wasted too much time. Right now, our powers are equal, but in ten minutes, you’ll be weaker. In twenty minutes, you can only hope for mutual destruction, and in half an hour, you’ll be a powerless bug in front of me.”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Lyrod was right. All that remained in his body was the last, tiny bit of energy from the First Star. It wouldn’t take him long, especially during a fight for survival.</p><br><p>Adam raised his chin as his eyes flashed.</p><br><p>“How arrogant. I like that!”</p>
