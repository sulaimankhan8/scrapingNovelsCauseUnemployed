            <br><p>What was of value to the higher nobles?</p><br><p>Could it be money like all people? After all, it was an important resource that even the rich and powerful relied on.</p><br><p>That was partly true, but unless the situation required insane amounts of money in the form of hundreds of millions, every high noble basically had a limitless supply of money. This was especially the case for nobles who held high family positions.</p><br><p>Status, reputation, and strength were crucial, but it wasn't something that could be exchanged or bought. Reputation was earned, and strength was acquired through time and difficult battles.</p><br><p>The only thing left was territories.</p><br><p>The Citadel was an actual structure made of steel and concrete. It was a massive, enormous object in the midst of a cruel world, but the Citadel never changed.</p><br><p>Sure, many events were happening inside the Citadel, in each of the rings, but their borders and walls remained constant.</p><br><p>The other great families didn't need to worry about their territories. They ruled in their wings, and the other noble families dared not claim their territory. It was foolish and pointless, even deadly for some.</p><br><p>The situation was different for the first four families. They were located at the first wing and were constantly fighting for both influence and territory.</p><br><p>Adam didn't know how they determined the boundaries of their influence, not that he cared.</p><br><p>But, now he was at the center of one such event.</p><br><p>"What...?" Adam raised an eyebrow in disbelief, "Territories? You said they'd be putting up territories?"</p><br><p>Observer no. 1, turned around, looking at Adam with a stern look.</p><br><p>"Yes, money can be put up too, but it's not that important. The final battle at the Twilight Palace is one of the few official ways the territories of the first four great families can change."</p><br><p>She smirked, "What's more, it's not square meters that are bet, but buildings or even entire streets. It depends on the wishes of the guests. After the battle is over, the territories of the losing side will be divided among the winners depending on who is closer to which place."</p><br><p>"However, that's not all. At the end of the battle, only our guests will gain and lose something, but..." a sharp glint passed over her eyes, "Is that fair? You will fight, so fighters should get something out of it too."</p><br><p>Without further ado, observer no. 1, pointed to the stars above Adam and Reinz's heads.</p><br><p>"Each of the fighters can make a wish. The four great families will be obligated to grant the fighter's wish if the fighter wins. But, wishes have limitations."</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head, "Limitations? What kind?"</p><br><br><p>"Financial. For every star, that is a vote from the observer, a fighter has a budget of twenty million for his wish. If the fighter's wish is unrealizable or costs much more, the hotel administration will offer other options."</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam glanced up.</p><br><p>During the betting, the cameras showed the number above his head, but the 2.7 billion was gone, the money no longer had the same meaning as it had a couple of hours ago. The number 7 next to the star remained.</p><br><p>"Seven... Does that mean my wish shouldn't exceed 140 million?" Adam suggested.</p><br><p>"Correct!" The girl exclaimed with a wave of her hand pointing at him, "Moreover, you have more votes than your opponent, so you'll make your wish first!"</p><br><p>Then, Adam remembered that Reinz was here, not that he forgot about his opponent, but he focused all his attention on the new bets.</p><br><p>Reinz stood silently at the other end of the arena. For him, as for Adam, this was the first and last final fight. Nobles could only visit the Twilight Palace once.</p><br><p>However, he was a talent from the first great family. He knew all of this, so he just waited patiently for the fight to begin.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, there was no fire or interest in his eyes.</p><br><p>'I see...' Adam muttered inwardly, 'He doesn't consider me a worthy opponent. Another arrogant enemy? Although... I've already become one, right?'</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam's eyes lifted. To his surprise, he saw that above Reinz's head was the number 6.</p><br><p>'What...? There were 3 billion bets on him, while I only had 2, until the last moment... And more observers voted for me than him?'</p><br><p>Soon, Reinz noticed it as well.</p><br><p>"How stupid..." he hissed, staring intently at the girl, "I've heard many things about observers, only good ones, yet only six of you voted for me? Adam Vinter is not weak, but... you believe in him more than me? That's absurd."</p><br><p>Strangely, his displeasure did not affect observer no. 1, she just smirked slyly.</p><br><p>"Shut up, kid," the girl waved her hand, "Each of the 20 observers made their choice. If you got fewer votes than your opponent, you might want to reconsider."</p><br><p>"Pure ignorance." Reinz spat out, "Only six out of 20 realize that no one at the Twilight Palace stands a chance against me. That's not even a third... Mr. Andreas should reevaluate who he recruits."</p><br><p>Reinz shook his head disapprovingly, "It's just a disgrace."</p><br><p>Then, Adam pointed to observer no. 1, addressing her:</p><br><p>"You, who did you vote for? It was one of the two of us, wasn't it?"</p><br><p>Tilting her head back, she grinned predatorily.</p><br><p>"I'm afraid that's a secret. But... If you win, I'll tell you!" she swung her coat, "Enough talk! Adam Vinter, your bet is four coins, speak your mind!"</p><br><p>It seemed there was too little time to come up with something worth 140 million.</p><br><p>But, Adam had an idea.</p><br><p>"Hey, observer no. 1, even at the first wing, part of the territory belongs to the government, right?"</p><br><p>"Sure," she nodded carelessly, "Administrative buildings and stuff like that are in every wing."</p><br><p>"Good." Adam chuckled briefly before raising his head, his eyes blazing, "Then, if I win, I want a mansion on government property, right in the center of the first wing!"</p>
