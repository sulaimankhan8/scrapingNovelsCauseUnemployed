            <br><p>Adam received many new abilities but didn't know what exactly they gave. He hadn't realized it yet, but the best way to find out what he was capable of was to put his abilities into practice.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes shone brightly as the snow-white energy covered his entire body.</p><br><p>Damien didn't say anything, he watched with interest as Adam used his new First Order - Dormant Needle.</p><br><p>The last time he used his First Order, Adam summoned a needle woven of many silver threads. It was attached to his hand with tight strings, preventing his hand and the needle from being separated.</p><br><p>When he went from K0 to K1-Level, his needle gained more capabilities. He could throw it, or conversely strengthen his grip with the extra threads making his attacks stronger.</p><br><p>So... What was Adam supposed to expect now? Strangely enough, at this point, he knew as much about his ability as Damien, Douglas, and Silvana.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The energy layer covering Adam shuddered before dissipating, quickly spreading around like streams of wind.</p><br><p>"Oh... Impressive, it's like you've grown up." Damien made the comment looking at Adam.</p><br><p>Threads? Damien didn't see any threads that were always Adam's faithful companion when he used his First Order.</p><br><p>Adam's First Order resulted in only one thing - a long needle in his hand, but... it wasn't the same needle as before.</p><br><p>The needle was much longer and larger, now looking more like a unique sword created specifically for Adam.</p><br><p>The blade of the needle was gray, but not like silver but like platinum, flat, with a small recess in the middle, on both sides, that looked as if something could fill it like lava flowing into a weapon mold while the blacksmith worked.</p><br><p>Because of the recess, the edges were slightly above the level of the center, they were sharp and extended to easily cut any target with the first swing. Now and then, a dangerous glint passed across the edges, reflecting its power level and impatience for battle.</p><br><p>Previously, Adam needed to use a sharp tip to slice through his enemy's armor, as his needle didn't have a sharp edge like some sword or similar weapon. No more, he wouldn't have to face such a problem.</p><br><p>Near the end of the needle, there was a small flat hollow for grip.</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that except for this spot where Adam's hand was located, there were sharp blades everywhere, it was a needle, not a sword, it had no hilt, no guard, no round back tip.</p><br><p>Also, this needle retained the main advantage of its predecessor. Light energy flows emanated from its elongated tip, covering the entire weapon like a veil and traveling towards Adam's hand.</p><br><p>The Dormant Needle looked calm and threatening at the same time, showing that it could pierce any target while still retaining some secret.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes returned to normal only to abruptly grow deeper.</p><br><p>His Evolution Tree shuddered, filling his mind with all the information he needed. Now that he was using his First Order, he had a better understanding of what he was capable of.</p><br><p>"Good, give me one minute, I need to lower my power." Damien said before closing his eyes and concentrating.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Soon, the entire chamber shook as if it were a massive earthquake. Douglas narrowed his eyes, standing confidently on his spot, but Silvana wasn't prepared for this.</p><br><p>Your next journey awaits at empire</p><br><p>She lost her balance, almost falling to the ground, but before anything meaningful could happen, the trembling stopped.</p><br><p>Douglas raised an eyebrow looking at Damien. He could sense that Damien's strength had dropped significantly, to the level he needed.</p><br><br><p>Adam wanted to say something as the mechanical doors opened, letting in a drone with a black case attached.</p><br><p>Damien waved a hand.</p><br><p>"Don't worry. It's not my Nexus, I want an interesting fight, not an easy win. I asked Beth to get me something to fight with against a Phantom like you." Damien said catching the black case.</p><br><p>Damien shrugged his shoulders.</p><br><p>"Right now you and I are on the same level, so... if I'm not careful your needle can slice me apart like a piece of paper, I'm sure of it. Without abilities I won't be able to block your attacks with my bare hands, that's just stupid, so... I need something to fight with." Damien explained opening the case.</p><br><p>It seemed unnecessary considering that Damien was a Second Rank Phantom, one of the strongest in the entire Citadel, but that wasn't true.</p><br><p>If he lowered his level to the beginning of the K2, where Adam was now, then they were really equals. The difference between them was only in their mastery.</p><br><p>Moreover, Damien was going to fight without his Nexus, abilities and energy, as if all he had was his physical capabilities.</p><br><br><p>The lid of the case lifted up, revealing a long black square rod lying inside.</p><br><p>"What...? What is it?" Silvana muttered in confusion, "Is that someone's Nexus? Why does it look so strange?"</p><br><p>Douglas shook his head.</p><br><p>"No, Silvana you know the answer to your question. Think of it in another way."</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes, she soon realized what the rod was.</p><br><p>But, Damien had already moved on to explain.</p><br><p>"It's the broken-off spike of one Dark Yellow Threat Monster. I took it since I assumed your needle would change, so I needed something you couldn't destroy in one swing."</p><br><p>Damien smirked, placing the black rod on his shoulder like a mace or short sword.</p><br><p>"There was a chance I was wrong, but looking at your new needle, I see I was right."</p><br><br><p>"What are you talking about? You speak as if you knew how I would evolve. Even I didn't know what would happen to my powers..." Adam said in a low voice.</p><br><p>Damien shook his head.</p><br><p>"That's not what I'm talking about. I can't see the future. But... I realized what kind of person you are and what a Phantom you're becoming. Say, you chose Immersion Door, didn't you?" Damien's tone became abruptly serious.</p><br><br><p>"You don't have to answer that, I can see everything by the sight of your eyes and your needle, that thing looks formidable."</p><br><p>Damien smirked before stepping forward.</p><br><p>"Try not to lose too quickly. You sacrificed quantity for quality, so... prove it was the right choice!"</p><br><br><p>Damien's silhouette disappeared as he found himself in front of Adam, ready to launch his first attack.</p>
