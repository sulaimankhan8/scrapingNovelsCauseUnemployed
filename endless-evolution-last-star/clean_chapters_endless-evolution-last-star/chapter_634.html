            <br><p>In a heartbeat, a multitude of memories flashed before Silvana, who by the will of the darkness had become an observer, a ghost floating high in the sky watching everything from the outside.</p><br><p>Everything was happening fast, accelerated several hundred times, but not a single detail escaped Silvana.</p><br><p>It all started with Adam's birth, in which nothing was interesting or noteworthy except that it happened in slums.</p><br><p>Back then, the field of vision for Silvana was severely limited as Adam remembered almost nothing while he was an infant - most of it was the faces of his parents - Leona and Gary.</p><br><p>Gradually, as Adam grew older, his memory became more rich and detailed.</p><br><p>Now, Silvana could see what the slums had been like almost twenty years ago, as little Adam walked the streets and tried to help Leona and Gary in any way he could by picking up the low-weight trash.</p><br><p>"Hmm... Because of Evolution Tree's words, I was afraid to touch the crystal, but so far it's fine. However... the most interesting part will start when Adam gets much older, won't it?"</p><br><p>The most interesting thing Silvana noticed was the few street fights Adam had been in, and how caring Leona and Gary were to him.</p><br><p>His parents, like most slum dwellers, didn't have steady jobs. If there were any companies like Yellow Shark in the slums, it was mostly people from the Third Ring.</p><br><p>For the slum dwellers, only frequent part-time jobs were available: scavenging somewhere, moving something, fixing something, picking something up, and so on.</p><br><p>However, for Leona and Gary, this was not a problem. They did their job, their parenting, and so when Adam was ten years old, a new member of their family was born - Trici.</p><br><p>A second child for a poor family was always a challenge, but globally nothing changed. Moreover, Adam was already older so he could help Leona and Gary more and often looked after Trici as her big brother.</p><br><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply as she watched Adam fight with the other teens. It wasn't because he was aggressive or bloodthirsty but because in the slums it was impossible to do otherwise.</p><br><p>"Good, it's hard to analyze how many times in the future that painful and violent experience helped him, but it's clearly one of the most valuable things you can take away from the slums."</p><br><p>The far parts of the slums were a dense layer of darkness for Silvana, as in many places Adam had never been to.</p><br><p>Also on some days, instead of something insignificant, she saw black spots.</p><br><p>Even if it was Adam's memories, it didn't mean he remembered everything he saw or experienced in his life. Some things were just forgotten and lost forever, like little details.</p><br><p>"I see... I've seen over a decade, but it's only been a few minutes, hasn't it?" Silvana glanced up.</p><br><p>She felt that the Evolution Tree was somewhere nearby, watching her. After all, this was the inner space.</p><br><p>Memories continued to flash before Silvana's eyes until everything abruptly slowed down as one of the most important days of Adam's life came - his test on Spark at the Morton Observatory.</p><br><p>Silvana was well aware of what had happened that day, what Aiden Henk did, and how Adam became a Natural Phantom, but hearing about an event and seeing it were two very different things.</p><br><p>Soon, horror and fear reflected on Silvana's face - Adam's desperation, the way he was trying to get out of the iron crate, the appearance of the monsters and the Phantom, and also... the arrival of the Silver Weaver.</p><br><p>"Shit... How awful is this... If this is the price for becoming a Natural Phantom, then it's too high..." Silvana muttered with a pale face as she watched Adam kill a Silver Weaver.</p><br><p>She had seen him fight many times, but... this was Adam's first fight against a monster and possibly the most dangerous. A few hours ago he was a teenager from the slums, and now he was a Phantom who killed a monster in a 1 on 1 combat in the brutal conditions of the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>Then, came the stage in Adam's life that Silvana knew best.</p><br><p>Adam pointed to Silvana's photo when talking to Douglas.</p><br><br><p>That brought a slight blush to Silvana's face and a satisfied smile to her face. She realized that Adam could choose any of the Operators that Douglas selected for him, but he preferred her.</p><br><p>Silvana chuckled briefly:</p><br><p>"Hah, good choice. Probably the best of your life."</p><br><p>After that, her gaze grew darker.</p><br><p>"Sometimes it doesn't hurt to praise yourself, does it?"</p><br><p>Events sped up again, showing Silvana only things she didn't know about, and those things were quite few since they had been working together as Operator and Phantom since that day.</p><br><p>At several points her face flushed deeply with embarrassment and slight shame - it was about those memories Jena was involved in.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree held nothing back, including several nights in which Adam became a man.</p><br><p>"Well... I was heavily involved in that myself to some extent." Silvana whispered.</p><br><p>Stay tuned to My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>She smiled bitterly, curling a lock of her dark hair with embarrassment on her face.</p><br><p>Everything went on as normal and for some reason, Silvana didn't see part of the memories going on after the fight against Essence Thunder Demon and before the treatment of his arm at the Miracle Observatory.</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes. She realized that it was something important, something that the Evolution Tree had mentioned earlier.</p><br><p>After Silvana saw all of Adam's memories up to the current second, she watched as they entered the White Cube and Adam passed out due to exhaustion, then the memories went back to the dark moment.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Silvana's eyes went wide filling with disbelief and terror.</p><br><p>"I want to live!" Kai screamed with all his might, a voice coming from the depths of his soul.</p><br><p>"Please help me!" Kai tried to find salvation while a multitude of monsters, the Sand Hounds tore him apart.</p><br><p>Kai was a young man from the slums, the younger brother of a girl who died at the Red Feast because she ate too much monster meat.</p><br><p>Under threat of committing suicide, Kai had forced Adam to tell him about the way to become a Phantom, a Natural One, and... it all eventually led to this moment.</p><br><p>"No... Why are you just standing still..."</p><br><p>Silvana whispered staring at Adam who was watching Kai's suffering and approaching death with a calm gaze.</p><br><p>"You could have saved him... Those weak White Threat monsters... Are you going to let them kill that little boy...?" Silvana muttered with a pale face.</p>
