            <br><p>Citadel, millions of people continued their lives just like the world itself, as time waited for no one, it always kept going and only forward, never turning back.</p><br><p>Adam was no exception.</p><br><p>One hour passed after another, from morning to afternoon, from lunch to evening.</p><br><p>The only thing that didn't change was that there was no way he could win.</p><br><p>In all this time, taking into account the long breaks, Adam lost to Max already 27 times. That meant he did 2,700 push-ups and had to buy 27 packs of cigarettes for Max later.</p><br><p>None of this was a real problem for Adam. One thousand or three thousand push-ups, there was no difference for him, only more push-ups required more time.</p><br><p>Even the most expensive cigarettes couldn't hurt Adam's finances much, but... none of that mattered amidst the fact that he was losing.</p><br><p>"It's 10:00 p.m. now. You know my workday ended two hours ago, don't you?" Max said calmly as he cast a glance at Tron.</p><br><p>Tron shrugged his shoulders.</p><br><p>"Sure, but he still didn't give up, so we can dedicate more time to this training." Tron pointed at Adam.</p><br><p>Though it was a digital copy of him, Adam looked exhausted. The endless defeats were pressing down on him like an invisible weight.</p><br><p>The last time he'd experienced this was when he'd found himself in the strange space where he'd faced the Plague Reaper, though he'd been dead by then.</p><br><p>Fighting against Max, he felt the same way.</p><br><p>It wasn't that Max was as strong as the Plague Reaper or that their fighting style was similar.</p><br><p>No, Adam felt that his mastery was not enough. He had good instincts and powerful abilities, a confident fighting spirit, and a strong will, but all of that was useful when there was any chance of winning.</p><br><p>All of Adam's attempts crashed against the sheer difference in their mastery.</p><br><p>And... There was something else that bothered Adam.</p><br><p>Taking a deep breath, he looked at Max intently.</p><br><p>"Hey, you've been holding back all this time, haven't you?" Adam narrowed his eyes.</p><br><br><p>Max tilted his head slightly, the question struck him as odd, even inappropriate.</p><br><p>"Adam, you're not some military man, I don't hold back against you. My blows are as strong and fast as possible with my current physical attributes."</p><br><p>Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>"No, that's not what I'm talking about. You fight too... too professionally, like some instructor or by textbook. But, you're strong."</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly as he looked at his hands, he saw many scars that he chose to leave after some important events in his life.</p><br><p>He once lost his right arm, for which he had to go through a difficult ordeal to get it back, to return it to the form it was originally in.</p><br><p>"In the battles I went through, I realized that great power at your limits is always closely matched by bloody, brutal violence."</p><br><p>Adam clenched his fist with an excited smile as he raised his gaze to Max.</p><br><p>"If two creatures are equally strong, it is not the one who fights smoothly and clearly like a manual who wins, but the one who combines his strength with pure brutality."</p><br><p>Max didn't answer anything. The expression on his face also didn't change in any way, but... everyone felt something strange.</p><br><p>A kind of aura was coming from Max, not from his copy, but from his real body in the chair in the room nearby.</p><br><p>Then, a slight, almost imperceptible smirk appeared on Max's face.</p><br><p>"Hah, looks like you're not just a talented Phantom, you actually enjoy fighting, or you wouldn't have realized it."</p><br><p>Adam replied with the same smirk, it seemed that for the first time in all their fights, they were on the same line, understanding each other.</p><br><p>"In that case, stop holding back. You're not restraining your strength and speed, but you're restraining yourself from being violent. Don't be afraid to hurt me, Damien didn't spare me and I don't want you to do it."</p><br><p>Adam said confidently as he took a fighting stance. He stepped forth, leaned his torso forward, and put his hands out in front of him, clenching his fists tightly.</p><br><p>Max nodded and pointed at Silvana.</p><br><p>"Unlike you, she's already seen some of what you're talking about, but the military isn't interested." Max shrugged. There was no arrogance in his voice, he just thought so.</p><br><br><p>Max stepped forward, one hand holding his wrist while he clenched and unclenched his other hand as if warming up for some complicated move.</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, once again remembering what Max did to the military.</p><br><p>'No way... Is he really going to do the same thing to Adam? No, that's unlikely. Adam isn't as weak as the military, he can hold out, and he'll still win in the end!'</p><br><p>Then, Silvana glanced at the barrier, the borders of the Blue Zone: Imagination.</p><br><p>'Wait... I just realized this, but every Max ended their fight with him killing Adam using the borders. It's never been the other way.'</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam and Max came into motion, about to attack each other in their last battle of the day.</p><br><br><p>They quickly faced each other meeting in the center of the arena as Adam's fist effortlessly managed to reach its target and plunge into Max's stomach.</p><br><p>However, before joy could appear on Adam's face, Max stepped forward with determination in his gaze.</p><br><p>His eyes were different from any past fights. They were calm as before, but they weren't unemotional, they were cold and bloodthirsty.</p><br><p>'No... Even if it was a successful strike, something is wrong... He didn't react to it at all, as if it was the price for what he was going to do next... Right, I have to retreat!' Adam inwardly exclaimed. He realized that this was no mistake from Max.</p><br><br><p>No sooner had Adam taken a step back than his eyes dipped down to see that his right leg was dislocated, his knee was turned at a strange angle.</p><br><p>He quickly began to lose his balance, trying to get back to normal Adam attempted to lean on his left leg but it was a trap.</p><br><p>Max's goal wasn't to knock Adam down or hurt his legs even more. Your journey continues with empire</p><br><p>He was going to finish their last fight right now.</p><br><p>"Yeah, that's a whole different case."</p><br><p>Max whispered as he like a ghost appeared behind Adam.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes jerked sharply to the side, trying to follow Max's movements and react somehow, but he barely had the chance.</p><br><p>Everything was happening too fast, Max was moving as if he could teleport, but it was all the simple agility and speed of the Light Yellow Crown Monster, elevated to an absolute degree by Max's mastery.</p><br><p>The first thing Adam saw was Max's hands moving toward his head.</p><br><p>Then, Adam's view changed as if his head would turn to the side, though he didn't give his body that order.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Clutching Adam's head tightly, Max turned it sharply, causing Adam's neck to twist several times.</p><br><p>A loud crunch spread around, from the breaking bones of his neck and spine.</p><br><p>The flesh cracked, releasing streams of blood, until Max thrust his arms upward, tearing Adam's head from his body with a massive burst of blood pouring out all around.</p>
