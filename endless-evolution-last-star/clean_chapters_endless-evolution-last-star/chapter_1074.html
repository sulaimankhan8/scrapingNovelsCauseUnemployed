            <br><p>Chapter 1074: True Lord<br>
Bam.</p><br><p>The Great Lord, the Earl, could rule a territory with hundreds of monsters that would follow his power, but… right now, one of them was splitting wind currents out of his will.</p><br><p>Serra’s face contorted in pain, her stomach dented by Saegar’s punch that sent her flying at the speed of a cannonball.</p><br><p>With a crash, she slammed into the ground, plunging dozens of meters deep. A pillar of dust rose upward like an explosion, leaving Saegar alone with the two young Lords.</p><br><p>Well, Horon and Kenex were many years older than Adam or any middle-aged man, but in front of Saegar? Hah, until they showed that they were strong, he couldn’t take them seriously.</p><br><p>“Hey, your leader just collapsed to the ground, aren’t you going to help her?” Saegar asked, slowly stepping towards them.</p><br><p>No matter how hard Kenex and Horon tried, they couldn’t hide the fact that they were nervous. They had expected Saegar to be a tough opponent, but not at the start of the fight.</p><br><p>According to their plan, trouble was only supposed to start when Saegar summoned his Arc, his weapon.</p><br><br><p>Kenex aimed his lance at Saegar, frosty energy running through the edges.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Saegar appeared in front of Kenex, his amber eyes growing darker, glaring at the Lord before him as if he were trash, nothing more.</p><br><p>“Going straight to arms? We’re not Phantoms… Using our weapons should be an emergency measure.”</p><br><p>“Shut up!” Kenex exclaimed as the tip shone brightly.</p><br><p>A frosty beam was about to lash out and pierce Saegar to turn him into a lifeless, frozen statue.</p><br><br><p>Saegar’s hand grabbed the lance tip, compressing all the frost energy into a small volume. Despite the pressure, he took no damage.</p><br><p>His hand was actively shaking, holding back Kenex’s attack.</p><br><p>“Is there something wrong? What a pity that you’re so useless that you can’t harm me. All my energy easily surpasses your weapon.”</p><br><p>Kenex’s eyes went wide in disbelief when Horon’s figure was reflected in his eyes. The great monster appeared behind Saegar, his hammer blazing with cruel flames.</p><br><p>Without turning, Saegar pointed at Horon with his left hand, just a fingertip.</p><br><br><p>Black electric shocks ran through his large body. His frame shook, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t even budge.</p><br><p>“Big guy… You have even less manners than these two. You’re not worthy to fly on my land.”</p><br><br><p>Saegar tilted his finger downward, causing Horon to collapse to the ground.</p><br><br><p>His roar ripped from below as he quickly jumped up, intending to reach Saegar and take revenge. Kenex tried to remain calm, but Horon might have lost his temper in a heartbeat.</p><br><p>After a few moments, Saegar looked back at them.</p><br><p>“In fact… None of you are worthy to fly on my land. Once you appeared, you did nothing useful, only brought fear to my people.”</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With an active shudder, cascades of electrical discharges erupted from Saegar’s body that swept through the air, covering an area several kilometers around the main island.</p><br><p>Then, Saegar let go of Kenex’s lance, taking a step back.</p><br><p>Kenex saw the moment. He tried to attack, only to realize that he could no longer feel the solid surface beneath his feet.</p><br><p>‘What the hell…?’ Kenex glanced around.</p><br><p>His blue eyes, full of growing panic, caught on the electrical discharges hovering in the air. They shattered his energy, preventing him from holding the platform beneath his feet.</p><br><p>Every Lord could do it as naturally as to breathe or walk, but everything had its own mechanism of operation. Without legs, it was impossible to walk, and without control of energy, it was impossible to stand on air.</p><br><br><p>Before Kenex realized it, he was on the ground as well as Horon, who tried to take off but failed.</p><br><p>There was no smirk on Saegar’s face or enjoyment of his power, just a disgusted expression.</p><br><br><p>Saegar lowered himself to the ground with his hands behind his back. He walked slowly toward Kenex and Horon, who united.</p><br><p>Somewhere off to the side, Serra burst out of the ground and rushed to the aid of her fellows.</p><br><p>Now, Kenex and Horon could not fly, at least not while Saegar’s electrical discharges were around. However, that was no barrier for Serra thanks to her wings, her Arc.</p><br><p>“So… Do you have something you can counter me with? Come on. You are Lord, though you are nowhere near my level. You, like the Second Rank Phantoms… As the highest beings of this world’s evolution, wield this power…”</p><br><p>Despite Saegar’s mystical, irritated voice, Kenex and Horon understood what he was talking about.</p><br><p>They looked at each other. Serra needed some time to get to them.</p><br><p>Kenex was the first to act as he had last time.</p><br><p>“As you wish, Mr. Saegar, but you should stop treating us as if we are weak! We are Lords just like you!” Kenex exclaimed.</p><br><p>Kenex was wrong. They were not equal, and it wasn’t just about pure power or status. There was something to Saegar that neither Kenex, Horon, nor Serra could possess.</p><br><p>Well, he wasn’t going to tell them that.</p><br><p>His goal was simple – find out what the three Earls of the Befallen Crown were capable of at the moment, conclude, and then kill them.</p><br><p>Saegar had no doubt that would happen.</p><br><p>A blue circle reminiscent of the one in front of Gladius, but less bright and not as stable, appeared in front of Kenex.</p><br><p>The entire ground around him immediately became covered in ice, his energy becoming much denser as well as his aura, allowing him to shatter Saegar’s electrical discharges hovering around.</p><br><p>Like Gladius in his battle against the two Barons, Kenex chose one of the several stars floating among the circle.</p><br><p>Then, with all his might, Kenex exclaimed:</p><br><br><p>The blue layer, as a growing sphere, traveled dozens of meters around, engulfing Horon, Kenex, and Saegar, who did not resist.</p><br><p>However, unlike the two Barons, they were not in another space. Kenex’s field simply covered the area where his special ability was now active.</p><br><p>In a split second, Kenex’s energy created ice pillars around Saegar, plunging him into the center of the arena.</p><br><p>Ice crystals soared between the pillars, their glow becoming brighter with each passing second.</p><br><br><p>Stomp. Stomp. Stomp.</p><br><p>A multitude of ice knights in heavy armor emerged from the crystals as the wild blizzard rained down on Saegar, trying to freeze him.</p><br><p>The ground shook with every step the knights took, the cold traveling deep into the earth, freezing everything in its path.</p><br><p>If there were two Barons in the center of the arena who were killed by Gladius, they would barely be able to resist a single knight. If they were faced with two ice knights, their flames would not help them, they would be guaranteed to lose.</p><br><p>Only Kenex’s blizzard would be enough to freeze their wings and reduce their strength, making their heart beat slower.</p><br><p>But… Saegar wasn’t even in a hurry to move. His posture did not change as his amber eyes shone brightly, carrying his light even through the layers of a blizzard.</p><br><p>All Kenex, the creator of the arena, saw was Saegar’s dark silhouette as the ten knights approached him.</p><br><br><p>With a rattle of armor, the knights raised their great swords, ready to turn Saegar into nothing more than chunks of frozen flesh.</p><br><br><p>Saegar took a deep breath, shaking his head.</p><br><p>“Well, well…” his low voice rang out like an ancient curse. “You had so many possibilities, so many options, and all you could create was this?”</p><br><p>The knights sprang to action.</p><br><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Saegar turned into a dark flash, leaving electric shocks behind him.</p><br><p>The black thunder destroyed Kenex’s arena as if it were made of ordinary ice instead of being his unique Lord ability.</p><br><p>Before Kenex could realize it, Saegar appeared in front of him, grabbing him by the throat.</p><br><p>“I think I should show you what the abilities are. I was going to do it a little later, but… you’ve upset me so much that now I’m doubting it.”</p><br><p>Kenex tried to get out, but Saegar’s grip was too tight. He needed to push a little harder to break Kenex’s neck, once and for all.</p><br><p>“Get your hands off him!” Horon exclaimed, his hammer was in a wide swing.</p><br><p>Saegar didn’t even look in Horon’s direction. He knew what had to be done, so…</p><br><br><p>The hammer crashed to the ground with a fiery explosion, shaking Saegar’s colorful land that was slowly losing its beauty due to the battle that had begun.</p><br><p>But, neither Saegar nor Kenex was at the scene of the impact.</p><br><p>“What…?” Horon’s eyes went wide as he looked up.</p><br><p>Like black lightning, Saegar was splitting the blue sky, holding Kenex in front of him like an unwilling puppet. He flew upward, not stopping even when one of the islands loomed ahead of them, piercing through it.</p><br><p>As they disappeared behind the clouds, Saegar tossed Kenex aside, watching his slow fall.</p><br><p>“Good, just be a target for me,” Saegar muttered as electrical discharges began to build up in his hand.</p><br><p>Soon, a dark thunder spear would pierce the heavens, and the first victim would be the once proud Earl.</p>
