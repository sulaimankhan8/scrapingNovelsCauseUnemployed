            <br><br><p>Adam's fist slammed into the wall at full power, a moment before a wounded Giselle was in its path.</p><br><p>Shivers ran through the barrier one after the other, blue electric discharges scattered to the sides, causing even observer no. 3 to express his amazement.</p><br><p>"Oh, how curious..." the blond-haired man muttered, a sly smile on his face, "It's not often you see a K3-Phantom be able to shake the barrier, though Adam wasn't the only one who influenced on that."</p><br><p>Silvana turned to him, confusion on her face.</p><br><br><p>The observer no. 3, just smiled, pointing upwards.</p><br><p>With a blue flash, a massive mirror appeared out of nowhere on the barrier, large enough to hold an entire person. The surface was glass, but just as smooth, reflecting the surroundings.</p><br><p>A silhouette of light appeared outward, soon transforming into Giselle.</p><br><p>Only half of her body peered out of the mirror, staring intently at Adam remaining below.</p><br><p>Her back was torn, her right arm broken and unusable for combat, blood flowed from the corners of her mouth, but her eyes had not lost their flame.</p><br><p>Adam kept his promise, and Giselle didn't lie as well.</p><br><p>She was strong and knew what to do in critical situations. It was hard for her, everyone in her place would be in such a scenario, but it wasn't the worst outcome she faced.</p><br><p>At first she tried to defeat Adam in a straight fight, then she realized that it was impossible and changed her tactics to a long distance fight.</p><br><p>However, this brought no results other than vivid pain.</p><br><p>'Hmm... He was right,' Giselle pondered, 'I paid for my arrogance. I should have gone straight to this format of combat, but...'</p><br><p>Her eyes stopped on him for a while, intently studying his aura.</p><br><p>'I wasn't wrong. He should be weaker. Even if he defeated the Crimson Monarch... I've been training since childhood, a commoner can't afford something like that, especially one like him - from the slums.'</p><br><p>Adam raised his head as he directed his gaze at her.</p><br><p>'That's high,' he thought.</p><br><p>The ice mirror was only two meters below the ceiling. Given the Twilight Palace's size, Adam couldn't reach Giselle even with an amplified jump.</p><br><p>Moreover, something was bothering Adam.</p><br><p>'Her body, where is the other half? Damn, what is this strange ability, the first time I've seen such a thing.'</p><br><p>Giselle's face remained calm, but inside there was an arrogant expression full of contempt.</p><br><p>'Hah, that's the point Adam, that's the advantage of having different abilities. You probably think it can't be controlled, and... to a certain extent you'd be right.'</p><br><p>The blood stains were slowly coming off her eyes, returning her gaze to its usual sharpness.</p><br><p>'The Evolution Tree adjusts to your wants and needs. Do you want a net to catch monsters? With the next evolution, you're sure to get it, at the very least something with the same functionality.'</p><br><br><p>At the click of her healthy hand, an ice crystal appeared in the air.</p><br><p>That one was different from the other eight that she had previously dropped on Adam and Diron. The crystal was elongated, with a thin base and a sharp tip like a sword blade without a hilt.</p><br><p>The crystal shuddered slightly, but did not rush into battle, for at a wave of her hand, Giselle released a frosty vapor. One crystal after another appeared, drawing massive amounts of energy from her.</p><br><p>'Any noble who wants to be a strong Phantom and is not afraid of a challenge will at some point begin to wonder about his abilities.'</p><br><p>Giselle looked at Adam, who without emotion on his face continued to stare at one point.</p><br><p>'I've made progress in this. I can't say my set is perfect, but I'm proud of it, especially the ice mirrors and the blue crystals.'</p><br><p>Then, leaving the crystals floating in the air, Giselle disappeared into the mirror like a ghost.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Simultaneously, dozens of mirrors appeared on the walls, all it took was a bit of energy and the first shard to appear.</p><br><p>Adam turned around, a slight concern read on his face.</p><br><p>Every now and then, a glint ran across the mirrors. Giselle's silhouette was distinct, but it was fading too quickly to realize anything.</p><br><p>With a slight shudder, Giselle's left hand emerged from one of the mirrors, followed by a slight wave.</p><br><br><p>Frost projectiles, blue orbs flew out of the mirrors, raining down on Adam.</p><br><p>Without panic, Adam took a few steps to the side, the orbs shattering before his feet. Ahead of the last projectile, Adam took a short leap backward.</p><br><p>A layer of vapor blocked his field of vision, like a mist not wanting him to see beyond his own nose.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A shiver ran down the edges of the crystals before they all rained down on Adam in an ice hail.</p><br><p>Cold went across Adam's back, his instincts screaming, forcing him to pull back.</p><br><p>A crystal flew right in front of his face, sinking halfway into the ground.</p><br><p>Then, another one behind Adam's back.</p><br><p>Realizing he couldn't stay in the cloud, Adam jumped outside but was met only by Giselle's grin reflected in the mirrors.</p><br><p>A multitude of crystals headed towards Adam, seemingly leaving him no choice but to be wounded.</p><br><br><p>Adam grabbed the crystal coming at him, clutching it tightly in his grip.</p><br><p>Then, in a few swings, he shattered all the crystals flying in his direction, the shards flying before his focused eyes.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, observer no. 3 found himself startled, his pupils going wide - Adam was unknowingly using something that many K3-Phantoms didn't know how to do at the beginning of their new path. Otherwise, the crystal in his hand would have shattered at the first clash.</p><br><p>Giselle gulped, her face turning pale.</p><br><p>'How...? I wanted him to use the energy, to exhaust him. What is this speed, what is this precision...?'</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Adam appeared in front of her, white streams of dense energy covering his legs while his coat fluttered in the gusts of wind.</p><br><p>Giselle flinched, she tried to disappear into the mirror, but Adam was faster.</p><br><p>Grabbing her by the collar, Adam threw her outside, leaving her in free fall.</p><br><p>Before she reached the ground, a silver glint reflected in Giselle's eyes as Adam summoned his weapon, his first ability.</p><br><p>Giselle stretched out her arm in a desperate attempt to stop him, though she realized she was beyond saving.</p><br><br><p>Not hearing her scream, Adam bounced off the wall before swinging his needle several times.</p><br><p>Wide cuts descended upon Giselle, promising her nothing but pain and scars beneath the bursts of blood.</p>
