            <br><p>Every Type was known to have its own features, and Essence Ones were no exception, on the contrary, in certain situations, they could become the most dangerous of all Types, and right now, dozens of Phantoms had the opportunity to witness the reason with their own eyes.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon wasn't just able to use the lightning anomalies to boost his attacks, it wasn't a problem for him to eat an artifact to restore his energy reserves - yeah, just like that.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The electrical discharges coming out of Thunder Demon's body left dark stains on the salt lands until they gradually stopped. This was a surplus that Thunder Demon didn't need.</p><br><p>"Well, I think you realize now that attacking him while he was out of breath would be simply stupid and useless." Fred said with a calm gaze, looking at Thunder Demon.</p><br><br><p>"But... Doesn't that mean he's just invincible? As long as the anomalies are here, he can fight indefinitely and not get tired!" Adam waved his hand in disbelief.</p><br><p>Fred just shrugged. It was clear to him all along. Unlike Adam, he had fought Essence Type before, sure, it wasn't as dangerous as Thunder Demon, but their capabilities were the same.</p><br><p>'Yes, but that's not entirely true. Thunder Demon's energy and abilities really have no limits in this situation, however, you must realize that energy is one thing and physical stamina is another.' Silvana explained with a faint sigh.</p><br><br><p>"Even so. I'll be old and dead before he runs out of stamina. I guess we have nothing left but to wait for help." Adam said with a serious expression.</p><br><p>Silvana didn't answer anything, but she smiled contentedly. She was glad that Adam had chosen the safe option and would not put his life in danger again.</p><br><p>Adam wasn't the only one who had made that decision for himself, though. All the Phantoms hid wherever they could, Tirana's squad was no exception. No one wanted to fight the Thunder Demon, as getting away from here was still a problem.</p><br><p>Sure, with a cooperative effort, the Phantoms could get out of the anomalies around them, but it would take teamwork and most importantly - time. Certainly, Thunder Demon would not allow that to happen.</p><br><p>The anomalies couldn't hide as the Phantoms did, but the three main anomalies were strong enough to resist Thunder Demon if he wanted to absorb their artifacts.</p><br><p>However, Thunder Demon would only do something like that again if he had to expend a huge amount of energy.</p><br><p>Thus, even though there were dozens of Phantoms and hundreds of anomalous monsters imprisoned in a small area near Iron Beacon, nothing was happening.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon stood alone in the center of this deadly triangle formed by three anomalies, glancing around baffledly.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the number of potential opponents didn't matter when there was no one worthy among them.</p><br><p>Well, it was Thunder Demon who was the worst here. He had relatively recently absorbed a powerful artifact and became an Essence Type, his instincts had led him here since he felt he could use all of his new powers here.</p><br><p>Sure, he already performed several crushing attacks and brought death to many Phantoms and monsters, but this was not what he wanted.</p><br><p>A sword with a sharp blade had to cut and chop, flesh and blood, or it would rust and lose its purpose.</p><br><p>True, Thunder Demon wouldn't be weaker if he didn't find an opponent now, but his desire was immense, so much so that he was willing to go to desperate measures!</p><br><br><p>Thunder Demon, with his powerful steps, stood in the center of the area, looked around as if with a last hope, and raised his head. He could take his time and find everyone who was hiding, but would that be a worthy battle?</p><br><br><p>"What is he doing...?" Tirana, sitting behind the salt hill, muttered, watching intently as Thunder Demon opened his jaw wide.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon's eyes abruptly went wide as his entire body trembled.</p><br><p>"ROOOOOAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRR!!!"</p><br><p>Then, a terrifying roar came out from the depths of his throat, spreading hundreds or even thousands of meters away. The Phantoms closest to Thunder Demon had their eardrums ruptured, their ears bleeding, and their faces pale with fear.</p><br><p>"Is he calling for someone...?" Adam suggested, looking around, "But... who?"</p><br><p>Fred frowned heavily, realizing that the situation had just gotten a lot worse.</p><br><p>"Someone strong enough to fight him. Well, now it's all down to luck. Hopefully, someone won't be stronger than Thunder Demon or we can start writing wills right now." Fred bit his lip until it was bloody, with a great grimace on his face.</p><br><p>Adam stared at Thunder Demon and whispered slightly lost:</p><br><p>'Stronger than Thunder Demon...? Wait, given the circumstances, it can only be one creature... Are we really going to be that unlucky...?' Adam's eyes went wide when he realized what could be waiting for them.</p><br><br><p>Strangely enough, someone did respond to Thunder Demon's call. Some kind of creature, moving quickly towards the anomalies cluster, but not on the ground but in the air, using its two massive wings.</p><br><p>However, Thunder Demon could start to rejoice, for along with this creature came several dozen others, not as strong as their leader, but capable enough.</p><br><p>A random stream of wind reached Thunder Demon as he turned sharply towards the north. After a few seconds, he sensed powerful auras, and waiting a bit longer, he finally saw the first shadow that was particularly fast heading towards him.</p><br><p>Naturally, all the Phantoms and even the monsters were staring in the same direction.</p><br><br><p>The shadow stopped in front of the lightning barrier of anomalies, allowing everyone to get a proper look at it.</p><br><p>It was a tall girl with pale skin, snow-white long hair, and violet eyes with two pupils that moved around from time to time.</p><br><p>The girl had no breasts, only a flat torso with a deep triangular neckline formed by her chestplate, the edges of which were hammered into the girl's flesh with steel nails. There was no blood, for the top layer of her skin consisted of tough jade, providing excellent protection.</p><br><p>The girl's arms up to her elbows were bare, then began high gauntlets with sharp edges and pointed fingertips.</p><br><p>Two angel-like white wings grew from the girl's back, showing her superiority over the rest of the creatures here. On her head was a silver tiara, partially hidden by the locks of her hair.</p><br><p>The girl's lower body was what set her apart from the Crown Type, for she had no legs, but instead had a wide iron dress like a battle princess, from underneath which emanated a soft and gentle white light, with particles falling downwards like innocent snowflakes.</p><br><p>The weapon of this unusual monster was a huge two-handed sword with a snow-white blade sharpened on both sides and a long hilt.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>Soon, a few more similar monsters appeared behind the girl, they were a bit shorter, not as beautiful and elegant, and their wings were gray and dirty.</p><br><p>They had one-handed weapons and shields, but they all remotely resembled girls who had a chance to become as incredible as their leader.</p><br><p>Their leader was Conqueror Jade Lady, the Top-3 among all Purple Threat Level monsters.</p>
