            <br><p>'Adam, be careful, it is likely they have become significantly stronger. The energy here seems to have transformed them, and they are controlled by Voracious Krigias, their abilities may be very different.'</p><br><p>Silvana didn't know what the new Solitary and Mighty commanders could do. Their bodies were the same as before, but everything else was different, even she felt it through shared sight.</p><br><p>"Yeah, but they don't have weapons, they don't have help from the External Artifact, and most importantly..."</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the Solitary Commander disappeared, appearing to Adam's left. His arm was stretched forward, streams of blood came out of the gaps in his armor quickly morphing into a long spear.</p><br><p>Despite its speed and accuracy, the bloody spear swept before Adam's eyes, he managed to throw his head back, he saw all the movements of his enemy.</p><br><p>Yet, before he could counterattack, a massive shadow appeared from his right, a heavy fist bearing down directly on him, wanting to knock his head from his shoulders.</p><br><p>Tilting his torso slightly to the left, Adam slowly raised his arm.</p><br><br><p>The Mighty Commander's fist slammed into his palm, the brute force pushed Adam's palm forward, but the momentum was enough just for a brief period, stopping a few centimeters from Adam's face.</p><br><p>Glancing at his hand holding back a fist several times its size, Adam nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"They've definitely gotten stronger and faster, but blood can't replace their past weapons, but more importantly they're no longer fighters, they're just puppets."</p><br><p>The Solitary Commander attacked once more, the bloody spear carried straight for the back of Adam's head, but at the last moment, his silhouette shuddered.</p><br><p>In a fiery flash, Adam disappeared, appearing a few meters away. If most of the other monsters were in the commanders' place, the fire step would burn them, but it didn't have the same effect on the two commanders.</p><br><br><p>The second red ruga was knocked out of the crimson crystal, the last guardian was ready to break out of his confinement in the shortest possible time. His dungeon was strong enough to contain even him.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry..." Adam's quiet voice boomed through the temple, glaring at the two commanders, "But it looks like one fight is all we can have."</p><br><p>Without listening to him, the two commanders rushed forward, intent on continuing their pointless attacks. They had one goal, to destroy the intruder, and they were ready to do it at any cost.</p><br><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Adam closed his eyes, then when his eyelids lifted his bright blue eyes became much darker.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Black electric shocks ran down his left arm, X-shape circuits ran from his shoulder to his hand, ending at his wrist in a heavy bracelet.</p><br><p>"I defeated you once, my Operator will do it a second time."</p><br><p>The Solitary and the Mighty commander simultaneously leaped forward, appearing a few meters away from Adam, another second and their death grip would reach him.</p><br><p>Then, a dense energy traveled along Adam's arm, to the tips of his two folded fingers. In one sharp movement, Adam left a dark line in the air, hovering for a split second.</p><br><p>Adam exhaled a cold vapor as he watched the trembling line, warping space with electrical discharges striking in all directions.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, the black blade swept forward, destroying everything in its path. The two commanders had no time to react, when they lowered their gazes the blade already passed through their bodies, moving straight towards the crimson crystal.</p><br><p>In an attempt to do their duty, the Solitary and Mighty commanders stepped forward, wanting to reach Adam, but their legs wouldn't move.</p><br><br><p>The upper parts of their bodies fell to the ground with a thud. A powerful stream of blood rushed from the remaining parts, flooding everything around.</p><br><p>A moment later, a deafening rumble rumbled along the temple, black lightning reached the crimson crystal.</p><br><p>Shards flew off to the sides with dark drops of blood, the guardian had not yet left his prison but was already wounded.</p><br><p>But, the crimson crystal took most of the damage, a single attack even so powerful was not enough to kill the creature lurking within.</p><br><p>Adam's left hand went limp, falling to his hips, his fingertips trembling while the chains shattered into particles of dark energy.</p><br><p>'Are you all right? It took you a long time to recover last time.'</p><br><p>Silvana was worried about Adam, after all, this ability was one of his trump cards, energy wasn't the main problem, it was all down to Adam's durability.</p><br><p>With a great desire, Adam could create another black lightning bolt, but his left arm might just not be able to withstand it. His flesh would tear, his bones would break and the energy flow would turn unstable, the lightning could explode right next to him.</p><br><p>Hearing her voice, Adam nodded deeply, his expression was serious watching the massive silhouette, the smoke veil hiding it.</p><br><p>"Sure, I've grown stronger, I'll recover faster, your ability helped me win a difficult and long fight in just one move. That's worth a lot."</p><br><p>Even though it was his ability, he believed in what he was saying, and Silvana understood that. A happy smile formed on her face, making her wonder about her position in their duo.</p><br><p>'How strange... I was going to be an Operator to help the Phantoms, but I never thought I could do anything real, somehow affect the outcome of a fight with anything other than my knowledge and information.'</p><br><p>For a moment, something changed in Silvana's eyes. The Evolution Seed trembled slightly, responding to her emotions.</p><br><p>'Wait... If you think about it like that, a lot of what's happening now was previously unknown to me. No one will ever talk about Gene Diffusion in the academy and other things. Could it be that Gene Diffusion is just the beginning?'</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A deafening shudder interrupted her musings, forcing her to return to watching the battle closely.</p><br><p>The broad blade of a massive cleaver cut through the smoke screen, two red eyes filled with malice met Adam's blue, cold ones.</p><br><p>"Well, well... Who are you? My latest victim."</p>
