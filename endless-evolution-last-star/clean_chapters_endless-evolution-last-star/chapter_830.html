            <br><p>For hours Moira and Lone Blaze watched Adam connect one star to another. With each new star, it became more difficult to do so as the chain grew longer.</p><br><p>He didn't need to reassemble. He had more than enough stars to choose from. However, there were hundreds of them. Sometimes, he found the right one in a few seconds, but other times, it took him ten minutes or more.</p><br><p>Obviously, the larger the structure the harder it was to find the right star.</p><br><p>Sure, at the very end, when there were few options left, he could do it fairly quickly. However, he was still a long way from that.</p><br><p>Adam took a step back, looking at his work.</p><br><p>"Fifteen stars, right...?"</p><br><p>His gaze was exhausted, he was tired both physically and mentally. He needed a rest, though he managed to get some good news.</p><br><br><p>As if following an invisible ladder, Adam descended to Moira and Lone Blaze stepped through the darkness.</p><br><p>"What do you think?" Adam waved toward the Second Key, "Assuming all I have to do is connect all the stars. How long would it take me?"</p><br><p>Lone Blaze was first. She looked intently at the Second Key one more time before replying:</p><br><p>"I realize you're in a hurry, but it's a difficult question. There's no telling how much harder it'll be for you to connect the stars closer to the middle. Moreover, I doubt you'll be putting in 16 hours a day. You won't be able to stand it, and thinking about it for that long won't just be painful, it'll be unbearable."</p><br><p>A bewildered expression reflected on Adam. He narrowed his eyes, staring intently at Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>"Hey, I understand that myself. There is no need to be overly dramatic. A lot of factors can affect the final time, but there's an average, right?"</p><br><p>Lone Blaze nodded quickly, she turned her gaze to the side.</p><br><p>"Sure, I'm sorry... Given all of the above and my observations, I think at the very best you'll need a few weeks. Fifteen stars in one day, there are hundreds of them. Even if you speed up, you're bound to slow down or even get stuck at some point."</p><br><p>It wasn't the kind of answer that would satisfy Adam. He didn't get mad at Lone Blaze, it wasn't her fault in the slightest.</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Adam stared at the point, weighing his options, "A few weeks you say? That sounds realistic. But, I don't have that much time. The next burst of energy will come out of Silvana in ten or even seven days."</p><br><p>With mild curiosity, Moira raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"Somehow you don't seem disappointed. You must be in a panic that you won't be able to save her in time, right?"</p><br><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, casting one last glance at the Second Key.</p><br><p>"Fortunately, I'm not alone in this world. I'm not the first to go through this path, there were other Phantoms before me. So I'm going to learn something previously unavailable to me as a K2-Phantom."</p><br><br><p>Like a ghost, Adam appeared beside Lone Blaze, patting her shoulder approvingly.</p><br><p>"Thanks, it's always good to have the opinion of someone experienced."</p><br><p>"Experienced?" Lone Blaze sighed, "You overestimate me..."</p><br><p>Not saying another word, Adam shrugged, leaving his inner space, his silhouette dissolving into the darkness, piece by piece.</p><br><p>However, for some reason he stopped, slowly turning around over his shoulder, he looked at Moira, who puffed up her cheeks and stared at his back.</p><br><p>After a moment, she realized she was spotted, quickly glancing away trying to show that nothing happened.</p><br><p>With a bitter smile on his face, Adam shook his head. He took a step back soon finding himself next to Moira.</p><br><p>Before she could turn around, his hand fell on her head, ruffling her hair.</p><br><p>"You did well too. I don't know if I would figure it out so quickly if you didn't point to the stars."</p><br><p>Continuing to stroke her hair, he added:</p><br><p>"If you wanted to do that you could just say so. You're lucky I noticed, who knows when I'd be back next time."</p><br><br><p>Moira shut her eyes, her fists clenched tightly.</p><br><p>"Stop doing that! You... You're just humiliating me! I would never want something like this in my life!"</p><br><p>However, Adam didn't rush to stop.</p><br><br><p>Well, he wasn't being cruel. Despite her words, Moira didn't cut him off. If she wanted to, she could hide in the Initial Gene or just throw his hands away from her.</p><br><p>"Hah, nice job, both of you."</p><br><p>With those words, Adam closed his eyes, dissolving into darkness.</p><br><p>The next thing he saw was the forest, it was in the same place. Just as he wanted, no one bothered him.</p><br><p>There was only one difference, instead of sunlight there was moonlight falling on the crowns of the trees.</p><br><p>"Oh..." Adam grunted, his gaze deepening, "I thought it was two, three hours tops, but..."</p><br><p>A cold torrent of wind blew nearby, reminding him that it was long past evening, night covered the entire Citadel.</p><br><p>"It's been much longer than that, ten hours at least."</p><br><p>Adam raised his head gazing intently at the moon.</p><br><p>'Lone Blaze is right,' he thought, 'A few weeks is at best. Well, I'd figure it out myself if I wasn't in a hurry. However, right now I have no other choice. I must contact Seyrina.'</p><br><br><p>The next day, Adam and Silvana were sitting in the same room as their previous conversation. However, now they were at the Fort Norton.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana looked at each other, she smiled slightly.</p><br><p>"Two days off has done you good. You look much better, but... you're kind of broody."</p><br><p>"Well..." Adam scratched the back of his head with a complicated expression, "It's not that simple. I have some issues with the Second Key, but I think I'll get there in time. I need to consult with Seyrina."</p><br><p>Silvana blinked as she glanced at her watch.</p><br><p>"Strange, she was supposed to be here ten minutes ago, and... Why would she make an appointment at this place? Is there some reason for that?"</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the door opened.</p><br><p>However, it wasn't Seyrina who stepped in.</p><br><p>"Hey, guys. Long time no see."</p><br><p>Douglas said with a wide smile, looking at their shocked faces with undisguised delight.</p>
