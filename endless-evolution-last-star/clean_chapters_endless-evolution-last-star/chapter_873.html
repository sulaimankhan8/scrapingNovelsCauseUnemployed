            <br><p>Had Adam ever imagined this moment?</p><br><p>Quite possibly yes, like any guy who is in constant contact with a girl who has a more than friendly relationship with her.</p><br><p>However, all the Phantoms and Operators have heard many times about the prohibition of relationships, to some extent of love itself.</p><br><p>Well, Operators and Phantoms did not seek to break that rule. After all, they were in a special relationship, it didn't necessarily have to lead to anything romantic.</p><br><p>But... at K1 and K2 levels, the Phantoms and the Operators were beginning to have doubts about whether this ban was worthwhile because it wasn't just stupid - it didn't work.</p><br><p>The higher the level, the more the Phantoms and Operators stopped being mere combat partners. Their relationship grew into something more.</p><br><p>It was everyone's choice.</p><br><br><p>Right now, the choice was facing Adam.</p><br><p>He couldn't and wouldn't hide that he was enjoying this moment to the fullest, Silvana's soft lips and her warm embrace.</p><br><p>However, over his journey together with Silvana he had grown mature enough to realize that in a few seconds when their lips parted, he would have to look her in the eyes and make a choice, perhaps the most difficult of his life.</p><br><p>Did Silvana understand that?</p><br><p>Sure, she knew all the risks.</p><br><p>When she kissed Adam she changed their relationship forever. She took a step forward, crossed a line, and it was impossible to go back.</p><br><p>If Adam didn't accept her, their relationship would suffer a severe blow, yet she went for it because she couldn't stand the feeling of tearing her up inside anymore. She wanted it with all her soul.</p><br><p>All this, Adam understood perfectly well, which made Silvana's determination rise to new heights in his eyes.</p><br><p>In complete silence, Silvana let go of Adam's neck, which she clung to, their lips parted.</p><br><p>Then, their eyes met, Adam remained in daze, while Silvana was nervous. She didn't need to say anything, Adam wasn't stupid.</p><br><p>For a minute there was silence. No one said anything.</p><br><p>Silvana's heart was beating faster and faster, she was nervous, and Adam could hear it.</p><br><p>Then, her lips quivered, but before she could say anything, Adam touched her shoulders. He pressed forward slightly and pulled Silvana down onto the bed.</p><br><p>He was wearing nothing but a lone beige towel, his lean body not having time to recover from his evolution remained muscular, making Silvana's face redder than it already was.</p><br><p>"Silvana..." his voice trembled, though he tried to sound steadfast, "You do realize there's no turning back, right? We... We'll never be the same again, not you or I..."</p><br><p>With a gentle smile on a face full of love, Silvana reached her hands forward touching his back.</p><br><p>"Sure... though I think we've been going around this point for a while now... We just haven't let it happen."</p><br><p>Adam nodded, in slow, careful movements undressing Silvana. She didn't resist, on the contrary, she lifted herself slightly off the bed to help him.</p><br><p>With a face full of embarrassment, Silvana gulped as she turned away for a few seconds.</p><br><p>"Back then, at the hospital... When my flames tried to burn everything around me. You saw the whole thing, didn't you?"</p><br><p>"Yes." Adam replied confidently, touching her soft skin, "But... I didn't have time to enjoy the view then."</p><br><p>Then, Silvana turned as their gazes met.</p><br><p>With a slight hesitation, they kissed again while their movements became more confident and eager.</p><br><br><br><p>A pleasant, warm morning in a soft, large bed in one of the most luxurious hotels in the entire Citadel.</p><br><p>None of it at that moment mattered to Adam, nothing but the girl who lay beside him, her eyes closed, Silvana still asleep.</p><br><br><p>Adam took a deep breath, remembering the events of last night.</p><br><br><p>Sure, Adam was young, he couldn't help but think back to last night every few seconds. He and Silvana didn't hold back, there was nothing more to hide from each other.</p><br><p>However, when the euphoria of the kiss and the new stage in their relationship had passed, Adam felt something unusual coming from the very depths of his soul.</p><br><p>There was no longer any gravity that he was missing an opportunity that he and Silvana needed to take a step forward, but couldn't because of the rules and their own fears.</p><br><p>In that moment, Adam felt a relief unlike anything experienced before.</p><br><p>'Damn...' he internally muttered, his eyes closed, 'I've never felt this calm. This... this is what I needed. Silvana and I took that step and all the worries disappeared...'</p><br><p>At the same moment, an active shudder echoed in Adam's inner space.</p><br><p>Adam didn't notice it right away, the trembling was faint, even for him it was hard to realize that something was happening.</p><br><p>At the same time, Silvana's eyelids twitched. She slowly opened her eyes immediately directing her caring gaze to Adam.</p><br><p>"Good morning..." she purred, "Looks like despite what happened during the night, you got a good sleep. You look more refreshed or something..."</p><br><p>Adam turned, meeting her gaze, a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Well, we got back late last night and it's already dinner time. And you and I got more than enough sleep, anyway, we need to get back to work."</p><br><p>With a short laugh, Silvana ran her gaze over his shoulders, then down his chest.</p><br><p>"I don't usually say this, but we can afford to lie in bed a bit more today. After all, there's no rush for us. If we want to, we can stay at the Twilight Palace as long as we want."</p><br><p>Adam only nodded slightly, now he felt peaceful on a new scale.</p><br><p>Suddenly, his eyes shone brightly, just like when he used the ability but much stronger.</p><br><p>From Adam's confused expression, Silvana quickly realized that this was not happening by his will.</p><br><p>"Wait! Adam, what's going on?"</p><br><p>Before he could respond, Silvana's eyes shone just as brightly.</p><br><p>They both found themselves in Adam's inner space, standing in front of the Crystal Gates - the first lesser gates were actively trembling.</p>
