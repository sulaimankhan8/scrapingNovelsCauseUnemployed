            <br><br><p>Everyone headed after Gladius, unlike him who felt like a fish in water, not everyone was comfortable being in such a place.</p><br><p>Nelya felt it especially strongly, even for Silvana such a thing was within the realm of acceptable. After all, she was an Operator who saw many bloody battles albeit through a screen, while Nelya was a mere human.</p><br><p>"What is this creepy place...? It looks like an altar of bloody sectarians rather than the residence of a great family..." Nelya gulped, slightly shuddering in fear with every step.</p><br><br><p>Franz approached her, stroking her shoulder with a reassuring smile.</p><br><p>"Well, this is quite different from the residences that belong to our family, but... considering it's the ninth wing and who this family is, it all falls into place. I mean, you shouldn't expect anything less from them." Franz waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>His casual manner of speech helped Nelya come to her senses, his voice making her believe that this all was normal.</p><br><p>Humans were willing to accept and adjust to a lot of things if they didn't think it was something strange.</p><br><p>"Alright, I'm sure when you see the view from here you'll fall in love with this place, I promise you!" Gladius uttered energetically before walking over to the massive black doors and placing his palms down, applying force.</p><br><p>The doors slowly opened revealing a passage into a long hallway, a few sparse red lamps in the shape of skulls illuminated it.</p><br><p>"Gladius, though I know almost nothing about you except that you are very strong." Adam said in a low voice, "But, I can't help but notice that you're practically a fan of the ninth wing and Noukx Family."</p><br><p>In response, Gladius showed him a weak smile and shrugged.</p><br><p>"What can I say? The ninth wing is a very convenient place to conduct business that couldn't be done anywhere else."</p><br><p>Gladius's calm smile turned into a sinister grin.</p><br><p>"And... I wouldn't say I'm a fan of the Noukx Family, but their current head is indeed noteworthy."</p><br><br><p>Gladius's hand fell on Adam's shoulder before he headed off into the distance of the aisle.</p><br><p>"I'm sure we'll meet again after The Rule of Power, and you'll be the one to initiate that meeting." Gladius's voice echoed, bouncing off the cold walls.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion but made no move to say anything.</p><br><p>'Hmm? Why would I want to face him? He's strong, too strong, I'm a long way from his level, that's for sure.'</p><br><br><p>The cascades of footsteps, heavy and light, loud and quiet rang out across the first floor of the Crimson Eye.</p><br><p>It seemed that the building was empty, that they were the only guests there, that no one was expecting them.</p><br><p>They came to a spacious platform in the center, it was an elevator moving along a red rod. There were no safety walls, no glass, no doors, it was necessary to just stand straight or else...</p><br><p>"Ladies first!" Gladius stood next to the platform and bowed low with a swing of his arm.</p><br><p>Rosalind snorted, stepping forward confidently.</p><br><p>"Damn, stop acting like a clown, we're not in a circus." Rosalind was the first to stand on the platform.</p><br><br><p>"You think I'm a clown? What a pity..." Gladius scratched the back of his head with an awkward smile, "I'm just trying to be polite and cheer everyone up!"</p><br><p>Continue reading at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Rosalind rolled her eyes. She wasn't going to believe a single word of Gladius's since she realized how scary that man could be when he was serious.</p><br><p>Nelya along with Franz were next.</p><br><br><p>Baren took Osana's hand and threw her forward with a playful smile on his face.</p><br><p>Osana didn't have time to react, she blinked her eyes as she was already in flight and somehow needed to regain her balance.</p><br><p>But... after a heartbeat, Baren's hands caught her, lowering her to the platform. Somehow, he was there faster than she was, though he was the one who threw her forward.</p><br><p>"Hey, can't you be a little more serious? Rosalind is right, one clown is more than enough." Osana frowned heavily and stepped aside.</p><br><p>But soon, a slight, satisfied smile appeared on her face, it was as if she was back to her childhood for a moment.</p><br><p>So that left only Adam and Silvana, they didn't bother to make up anything and just took a few steps forward.</p><br><p>"How boring." Gladius shook his head disapprovingly.</p><br><p>Baren nodded in confirmation.</p><br><p>"I agree, I'd drop Silvana off or bring her here in my arms if I were you."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, looking at them with a strange look.</p><br><p>'Looks like those two are completely bored. Well, hopefully, that feeling will leave me soon as well.'</p><br><p>Adam glanced up, his gaze deep and dark.</p><br><p>'Unlike them, I don't need anything but a fight. At least the Marzo Family doesn't have much time left.'</p><br><br><p>The platform glowed brightly and automatically lifted off at high speed. In just a few seconds, they were at the very top of the Crimson Eye, though it was a building comparable in height to a skyscraper.</p><br><p>Nelya's and Silvana's legs trembled from the exertion.</p><br><br><p>Soon, the eight shadows entered the main hall - the eye, covered on all sides with glass. Though they were in the center, they could see the far reaches of the ninth wing and hundreds of glowing night lights.</p><br><p>Moving a little farther up the three steps, they saw the main panoramic window with a wide sofa in front of it, where more than ten people could easily fit.</p><br><p>But, now, there was only one person there, enjoying one of the best views in the entire ninth wing from his personal tower.</p><br><p>He was gazing not only at the night city that was especially active in the ninth wing but also at one of the main arenas - the Moon Colosseum - a few kilometers ahead.</p><br><p>Then, the man slowly turned his head, his turquoise hair and eyes shining brightly like ghostly lanterns.</p><br><p>"You are finally here. Welcome fighter number one - Adam Vinter."</p><br><p>Kogen said in a calm, deep voice, his eyes had a fascinating yet frightening glint like a mad star.</p>
