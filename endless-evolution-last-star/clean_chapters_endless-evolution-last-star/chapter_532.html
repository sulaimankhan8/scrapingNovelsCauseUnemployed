            <br><br><p>The long cape with the Eight Blades emblem swept under the lamp light before catching on the tight rivets of the long coat.</p><br><p>"So, when does my exit come?" Adam asked again looking at his image in the gray outfit.</p><br><p>Franz smiled slyly, waving his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Closer to the evening. Before Osana and Nirosh officially become husband and wife, there will be a long speech from their family members, then from the person in charge of the marriage, and so on."</p><br><br><p>"You must realize that a wedding between nobles is an event full of traditions and formalities that must be followed. We will give you a signal, moreover, I think Osana has already sent you a message. The wedding will keep to a strict schedule."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, looking at his reflection in the mirror.</p><br><p>Today, yesterday, and even two days ago, Adam had occasionally received messages from Osana with always the same thing.</p><br><p>'Today she sent me three messages at once, even though it's not even lunchtime yet. Yesterday there were only two messages. She's nervous. Well, she's usually calm and calculating, but I understand her...'</p><br><p>Adam clenched his fist tightly, his blue eyes becoming deeper.</p><br><p>'Right now her fate literally depends on my actions. If I leave now, no one can help her with The Rule of Power. Well... She's lucky she decided to choose me. I won't break my promise.'</p><br><br><p>Franz clapped Adam on the shoulder encouragingly and headed for the exit, outside the window, a white, long car pulled up to the store.</p><br><p>"Good luck. Just follow the plan and everything will be fine. Getting to the wedding of the high nobles is no easy task, but not when your allies are just as high nobles."</p><br><p>Adam cast a glance at them.</p><br><p>Rosalind bowed slightly and followed Franz like a soldier with a steady stride. They were wearing similar clothes as before, but more opulent and colorful, specifically to stand out among the other nobles at the wedding.</p><br><br><p>Adam took a deep breath and sat down on a wide armchair, putting his feet up on a low wooden table, he was alone in the spacious store. All he could do was wait, just like 85 days before.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Electric shocks ran through his fingertips as several rippling threads reflected in his eyes. Adam's heart beat faster and his aura thickened, willing the remaining hours to pass as quickly as possible.</p><br><br><p>A man in an austere, tailored suit reminiscent of a butler stood in front of dozens of identically dressed people who all had the same goal.</p><br><p>"Today we have a special event. You are all experienced workers and well prepared, so I expect you to provide perfect service. None of the guests should have a single complaint!" The head waiter said loudly while looking at the waiters.</p><br><p>"Yes!" The waiters simultaneously replied as if they were not attendants at a wedding, but a squad of military personnel in front of their commander.</p><br><p>Then, the head waiter turned to the end of the row, looking at the two waiters that came last.</p><br><p>"One more minute and you would be late. You're in luck. You will enter the room with the appetizers first, walk around the circle, and leave the appetizers on the first table. Do you understand?" The man uttered, lifting his chin.</p><br><p>Gladius bowed slightly, his hand on Silvana's back, forcing her to do the same. She was lost, but Gladius's acting skills were enough for the both of them.</p><br><p>"Sure, you don't have to worry. After all, I've been a waiter for a whole day now."</p><br><p>The man snorted with a frown on his face.</p><br><p>"Pffft, decided to make a joke? Whatever, just don't cause trouble. The guests will be busy with their pseudo-important conversations, then the marriage ceremony."</p><br><p>The head waiter waved his hand, straightened up, and headed for the kitchen. He needed to talk to the chef.</p><br><p>The kitchen was far away, but the smell of the food easily reached this room, especially the spices filling the space.</p><br><p>The cooks had a difficult task to satisfy the nobles, to make them marvel at the exquisite tastes, even though food considered luxurious for ordinary people was something usual for them since their birth.</p><br><br><p>Gladius took a step forward, looking around.</p><br><p>"Well, well, the dishes are on their way, the guests are gathering and soon the noise will fill this magnificent palace. Agh..." Gladius sighed as his eyes narrowed and the corners of his lips curved, "This is going to be the best wedding ever. I'm firmly convinced of that."</p><br><p>Silvana as well as the other waiters cast odd glances at him but didn't say anything.</p><br><p>'Gladius... Why do I feel like I've heard that name somewhere? Hmm... It can't be called a popular name, so there must be a reason why I have this feeling. Damn, Silvana, now is not the time to be thinking about this! How are you ever going to work as a waiter?</p><br><br><br><p>At this time, while the first guests were arriving at the palace of the Rouzet Family, one of the most important persons of the evening was walking down a wide, seemingly endlessly long corridor.</p><br><p>The marble floor reflected the light from dimly shining lamps placed between various paintings, hanging on the walls for years, among golden ornaments, in front of panoramic windows going up to the tops of seven-meter ceilings.</p><br><p>This part of the palace was still quiet, and there was no room for guests.</p><br><br><p>Osana stepped forward, a slow, unwelcome, forced gait. Reaching the corner she stopped, her eyes narrowed slightly, looking at the silhouette leaning against the wall, waiting for her for who knows how long.</p><br><p>"Reinal... My brother, what can I do for you?" Osana asked gazing at the young man with short pink hair, a stern stare, and eyes like hers. Your next chapter awaits on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>His arms were crossed on his chest, his head lowered to the ground to slowly turn around glaring at Osana.</p><br><p>"Well, I'd like to congratulate you on your wedding, once again." Reinal said calmly.</p><br><p>Osana nodded deeply.</p><br><br><p>Then, Reinal raised his chin high, staring intently at Osana from top to bottom with his cold gaze, as if he was trying to see what lurked in her mind.</p><br><p>"Enough of these vile pleasantries. Tell me, what are you up to?"</p>
