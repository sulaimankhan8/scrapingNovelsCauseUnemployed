            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1340: Dark Coat</strong></p><br><p>For the past few days, Norax had been personally training Adam. Unlike Karso, Narica, and Misty, he had no intention of helping Adam with the Energy Axis.</p><br><p>All Norax wanted was for Adam to reach his limit; he wanted Adam to be as strong as possible.</p><br><p>After all, his success at the Silver Beacon depended on it, and therefore, whether he would win or lose. Norax needed him to win, not only to entertain himself and see a rare show, but for all of the Forgotten Mills, especially for the territory of the Black Cut.</p><br><p>Sure, no one told Adam what would happen after he got out of the Silver Beacon; that was part of Norax’s plan and desire.</p><br><p>However, that didn’t mean they were going to hide everything from him, only the last part, but not before that.</p><br><p>“So? Do you think you’re ready?” Norax asked, glancing at Adam, who was sitting on the other side of the table.</p><br><p>The table was full of food, wine, and other drinks, and the only one who was actively eating was Karso. Narica and Misty were quietly enjoying their dinner, and even Adam was in no hurry to grab everything off the table to satisfy his hunger, as he usually did.</p><br><p>It wasn’t about the food; there was plenty of meat and various fruits and vegetables in front of him, a little strange but edible. It was all about his mood.</p><br><p>“Yeah, I think so, but despite all your explanations, I still don’t fully understand what an Ancient Artifact is, or more precisely, the Silver Beacon.” Adam frowned and looked toward the distant silver glow.</p><br><p>“Well, as I said, first you need to do everything necessary for the Silver Beacon to accept you. That will be your first step, then you will understand what to do and how an Ancient Artifact differs from an External Artifact.” Norax waved his hand.</p><br><p>Misty nodded weakly. “I’m sure you can handle this task. I don’t know if you’ll be able to go further, but getting inside shouldn’t be a problem for you.”</p><br><p>“Hell yeah!” Karso exclaimed, slamming his fist on the table. “Adam, don’t think about it too much! Just go to the Silver Beacon and show them what you’re capable of. That’s all!”</p><br><p>Narica sighed softly. “I agree. The Ancient Artifact is a serious test for anyone, but it’s the Silver Beacon that sets the rules, so at this moment, only you have the opportunity to go there.”</p><br><p>A few moments later, Norax leaned on his hand and grinned broadly.</p><br><p>“You haven’t forgotten that something special awaits you at the Silver Beacon, have you?”</p><br><p>Adam took a sip of turquoise juice and nodded weakly.</p><br><p>“Desire of Beyond, right?”</p><br><p>Norax nodded slightly.</p><br><p>“However, I still don’t understand what it is and how to achieve it, and you’re in no hurry to help me. How do I know you’re not deceiving me and only mentioned the Desire of Beyond to get me to go to the Silver Beacon?”</p><br><p>In response, he chuckled.</p><br><p>“Hahaha, I wouldn’t stoop to something like that. What’s the point? I know what you need, and I’m sure you have every chance of achieving the Desire of Beyond at the Silver Beacon. That’s all I can tell you.</p><br><p>“As for what the Desire of Beyond is? Well, that’s for each person to determine for themselves. I can’t help you with that.”</p><br><p>It wasn’t that Adam didn’t trust Norax, but a few days ago, he didn’t even know about the existence of the Ancient Artifacts, and now he was hearing that he needed to go there to obtain the Desire of Beyond.</p><br><p>Silvana also had mixed feelings about this. She was able to find some information about the Ancient Artifacts, but considering how many times she stumbled upon restricted folders, it was clear that this was territory for the Lord Level, both in terms of energy and information.</p><br><p>“Are you sure? If you don’t want to do this, I think we can come up with something. Maybe we should ask Frida for help?’</p><br><p>Adam shook his head internally.</p><br><p>‘Nah, that doesn’t make any sense. Norax’s smirk annoys me, but he’s right, I really need to get the Desire of Beyond, and that’s my only option at the moment.’</p><br><p>Then, his gaze darkened as it shifted from Karso and Norax to Narica and Misty.</p><br><p>“Obviously, after everything they’ve done for me, they won’t let me go. We became allies for a time because it was their investment in my journey to the Silver Beacon due to its special rules.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Silvana nodded.</p><br><p>‘Got it. Then let’s do it.’</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam finished his juice and looked intently at Norax.</p><br><br><p>Norax nodded. “Good, just the last touch left?”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>Before he could understand it, a few minutes later, he found himself in a room in Norax’s mill in front of a large mirror.</p><br><p>Misty stood next to him and stared intently at him from all sides, or rather at his coat and clothes.</p><br><p>“What… What’s going on here?” Adam asked, confused.</p><br><p>“Well, we can’t send you to the Silver Beacon looking like that. Your clothes are made of monster threads… Hmm. However, you’ve been in so many battles that the fabric and threads are already badly worn. It looks bad!”</p><br><p>Adam looked at himself in the mirror. His coat was worn and wrinkled in many places, but he didn’t see anything special about it. He had long been accustomed to this appearance.</p><br><p>“Luckily for you, not only did I notice this, but the boss did too.” Misty tapped her lip before snapping her fingers. “The boss asked me to make something special for you, according to my taste. So, I hope you like it.”</p><br><p>At the same moment, a flash of darkness appeared behind him, causing Adam to turn around and see an outfit hovering above the platform like a ghost.</p><br><p>Adam’s lips curved upward in a satisfied smirk.</p><br><p>“Oh, that actually looks pretty good.”</p>
