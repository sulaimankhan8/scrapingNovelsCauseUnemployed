            <br><p>When Baren and Mariel hugged, the guests thought their first impression of Baren was wrong. He didn't look cold and cruel, nor did he have Gladius's menacing aura.</p><br><p>They saw only a joyful, cheerful young man who possessed great power. Perhaps some of the guests were touched by the scene, even though Baren destroyed the banquet hall upon his arrival.</p><br><p>In a way, he was allowed to do so, because he was Baren De Rouzet, at least in the past.</p><br><p>But... soon their opinions changed again, as drastically as the first time.</p><br><br><p>Istrid's arm slammed into the wall, halfway into the solid stone, wide cracks spreading around, only to be covered in thick blood a moment later.</p><br><p>Her arm managed to keep its shape, but the flesh was torn in multiple places, blood continued to flow in various streams, bones shattered into tiny pieces as if pressed under a multi-ton press.</p><br><p>If it was the arm of an ordinary person, it would explode into a hundred fragments and even the most experienced surgeons would hardly be able to put it back together.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."</p><br><p>Istrid breathed heavily, instinctively holding onto her severed arm. Dark blood coated her palm, pooling on the ground in large clots mixed with flesh.</p><br><p>She was in pain, but in her long Phantom journey, she had suffered more serious wounds. The biggest effect on her was shock, she couldn't believe that Baren could cut off her arm so easily, she didn't even have time to do anything.</p><br><br><p>Baren took a step forward, finding himself right in front of Istrid.</p><br><p>"I didn't come here to kill, and you're a member of a friendly family, so... I'm only giving you one chance. Back off now and leave Adam Vinter alone. You know he has the right to use The Rule of Power."</p><br><p>Baren's voice was calm, but his intentions were clear.</p><br><p>Istrid gulped and her eyes filled with fear.</p><br><p>She believed what Baren said, she realized that he would kill her if she didn't back down, right here and now.</p><br><p>And... in his case, he didn't have to worry about being punished for it by his family or noble society.</p><br><p>"F-Fine... I'll retreat..." Istrid muttered, slowly stepping to the side before glancing at her arm, sealed into the wall.</p><br><br><p>"You can have it. You're lucky you're so strong, the doctors will easily put your arm back in place."</p><br><p>Istrid flinched, she got the feeling that Baren threw her arm not even at full strength, it scared her, making her pupils constrict.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, a rush of wind swept by Baren's side as Reinal appeared to his left.</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Reinal's foot was like a spear aimed at Baren.</p><br><br><p>Baren's hand clenched tightly around Reinal's ankle, stopping him without apparent effort.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Another one? Reinal... go away. I don't want to tear your leg off." Baren said in a low voice.</p><br><p>His grip tightened, his fingers digging into Reinal's flesh, painfully pressing on his muscles, causing Reinal's face to contort.</p><br><p>"You... You're only making things more complicated! What's more, why did you only come now?!" Reinal exclaimed, clenching his teeth tightly.</p><br><p>It seemed like he was dissatisfied with something, or rather... was he offended?</p><br><p>Baren narrowed his eyes, bending Reinal's foot at the wrong angle, but not hard enough to break it.</p><br><p>"Why? Would it make a difference? Adam Vinter and The Rule of Power are already here anyway."</p><br><p>Trying to restrain himself from screaming from the growing pain, Reinal clenched his fists tightly and wheezed:</p><br><p>"Yes... I'm not talking about this day. If you hadn't left... Or, if you'd at least been there when the wedding was discussed, then maybe things wouldn't get to this point."</p><br><p>Reinal looked around, pausing his gaze on Osana for a moment.</p><br><p>"If you voiced your opinion and gave an ultimatum, then maybe that would be enough to ensure that this wedding would never happen!"</p><br><p>Silence fell for a moment, Baren's eyes grew deeper, then he nodded.</p><br><p>"Well, I only found out about it recently. I came as soon as I got the chance. And... I can't keep watch and protect others forever, restricting myself and their actions. It already occurred, and there's no changing it."</p><br><p>Baren loosened his grip, allowing Reinal to free himself, but instead of retreating, Reinal tore forward, unleashing several more attacks on Baren with resentment in his gaze.</p><br><p>In response, Baren easily blocked each of his attacks with light movements of his palm before stepping forward.</p><br><br><p>Baren's palm slammed into Reinal's chest, a loud pop from the compressed air spreading around.</p><br><p>The impact, threw Reinal aside with the speed of shells flying out of a cannon, smashing several massive tables with his back before finally stopping.</p><br><br><p>Reinal gasped, slamming his fist into the ground, he bit his lip, realizing that although things could be different, nothing else mattered anymore.</p><br><p>Reinal didn't try to get up, he didn't stand a chance against Baren, he was lucky that Baren decided to spare him and not hurt him, unlike Istrid.</p><br><br><p>A light clap sounded, it came from someone who wasn't supposed to be here, just like Baren.</p><br><p>"Bravo, not even a few minutes since your appearance you've already fully manifested yourself." Gladius uttered with a sly smile on his face.</p><br><p>He slowly approached Baren while continuing to clap his hands theatrically.</p><br><p>"You know, I saved Adam before you showed up, which means I saved Osana to some extent, so... can't you do me one favor?" Gladius smirked, his eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>Baren tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>"Hmm? What do you want?"</p><br><br><p>"Nothing out of the ordinary. Just want to test Baren Haltz for his strength."</p><br><p>Before Baren could give his answer, Gladius reached his hand forward.</p><br><p>Baren's eyes lowered, he wanted to assess the situation and make a decision, but it was already too late.</p><br><br><p>Gladius flicked Baren's chest, it was a harmless flick that probably everyone experienced.</p><br><p>A few seconds later, Baren flew out of the banquet hall, ending up on the ground amidst massive stone rubble torn from the wall.</p>
