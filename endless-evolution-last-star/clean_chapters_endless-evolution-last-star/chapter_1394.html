            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1394: Hot Bun</strong></p><br><p>An hour had passed since Adam entered Izardo. During that time, quite a few things had happened, and as Adam recalled them, he couldn’t even understand how he had ended up in those situations.</p><br><br><p>With a satisfying crunch, Adam took a bite of the bun. Steam rose from the hot meat, greens, and strange-looking but delicious onions.</p><br><p>“Damn, this is really good. I should go back there again. Silvana, do you remember where it was?” Adam asked.</p><br><p>“Sure, but let’s leave that for later. We have another task at hand right now.”</p><br><br><p>A few minutes ago, Adam got lost in Izardo, and even Silvana’s advice didn’t help him. It wasn’t that Adam couldn’t follow her instructions or that Silvana had a poor memory for maps, it was just that Izardo had changed a bit since then.</p><br><p>Some buildings had disappeared, others had appeared or been renovated. The same was true of the streets and roads. One month, you could get to your destination via one street, but a few weeks later, that route might be blocked.</p><br><p>As a result, Adam was left in the middle of the road, where dozens of people were passing by. To avoid bumping into them, he kept stepping back until, step by step, he bumped into something solid behind him.</p><br><br><p>He turned around and saw a simple-looking stall where a burly man and two girls were quickly preparing simple buns, various desserts, and dough snacks. Each box of food had a wooden sign with the price on it.</p><br><p>Adam wasn’t particularly hungry, and the food looked pretty simple, still… the smell alone was enough to make him want to try everything in front of him.</p><br><p>“Boss.” One of the girls poked the burly man in the shoulder and pointed suspiciously at Adam, who had been staring at them for almost half a minute.</p><br><p>The burly man raised an eyebrow. “Ah? What is it?”</p><br><p>As soon as he saw Adam, his face froze, and after a few moments, he smiled broadly.</p><br><p>“Young man, it seems you have come from distant lands, right?” He surmised and pointed to the buns with a wave of his hand. “I’m sure you’re hungry. Would you like something?”</p><br><p>“This…” Adam touched the back of his neck. “I just arrived in Izardo. I don’t have any money.”</p><br><p>The burly man waved his hand as if he were ready for such an answer.</p><br><p>“Don’t worry about it. It’ll be on the house.”</p><br><p>Before Adam could answer, a freshly baked, hot bun was in his hand.</p><br><p>“Thank you. I’ll definitely pay you back!” Adam said and quickly left, as Silvana had received new information. She figured out how to get to the Raven Beak, or at least she thought she did.</p><br><p>One of the girls raised an eyebrow, puzzled.</p><br><p>“Boss, you’re a good man, but I don’t remember the last time you gave someone something for free. Do you know this young man?”</p><br><p>Another girl nodded several times in agreement. “Yes, that’s not like you at all. What’s more, this young man is kind of strange.”</p><br><p>“Ughum, his intense gaze made me shiver. Maybe he’s a pervert? Tsk, if I see him again, I’ll report it to the guards.”</p><br><p>While the girls were trying to understand why Adam was behaving this way, the burly man couldn’t hold back his laughter.</p><br><p>“Hahahahaha! You should stop before you go too far.”</p><br><p>The girls exchanged glances.</p><br><p>“But, don’t you think so?”</p><br><p>The burly man shook his head as he placed a new batch of buns on an iron plate, right into an oven that ran not on wood or coal, but on crystals full of energy.</p><br><p>“This young man is new to Izardo, you can tell by his lost look. That’s enough to give him something for free to make him our customer right away, you know? But, the main reason is something else.”</p><br><p>His voice lowered as he made sure no one but the girls would hear what he was about to say.</p><br><br><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the girls’ faces froze.</p><br><p>Perhaps they should have felt fear, anger, or at least caution?</p><br><p>But… the reality was different.</p><br><p>“WHAT?” The first girl exclaimed as she couldn’t hide her excitement.</p><br><p>The second girl began twirling her hair shyly.</p><br><p>“Oh, now I understand. Damn, boss, you should have told us about this right away.”</p><br><p>The first girl nodded as she blushed, remembering that Adam had been right in front of them just a few minutes ago.</p><br><p>“Damn it! How could we have missed such an opportunity?”</p><br><p>“Hahaha!” the burly man laughed good-naturedly, knowing that this would be their reaction. “I’m sure he came here for some important business. Alright, let’s get back to work, we still have a lot of dough and meat to prepare!”</p><br><p>The girls nodded, but they definitely wouldn’t be able to get Adam out of their heads for the next few hours.</p><br><p>At Izardo, where hostility between humans and Phantoms was practically non-existent, Phantoms were a rarity, both male and female. So… for those seeking attention, going to Izardo was a good idea.</p><br><p>Fortunately for Adam, most of the monsters were too busy and not perceptive enough to see that he was a human through his hidden aura.</p><br><p>Otherwise, the monsters wanting to get to know him would have surrounded him, and he would have had no chance of reaching the Raven Beak.</p><br><br><p>‘I’ll have to figure out how the economy here works and how to make money. What currency do they even use?’</p><br><p>Adam pondered as he walked up the road.</p><br><p>‘Hah, who would have thought that after all this time I would need money again? I’m sure my millions of credits are useless here…’</p><br><br><p>After a few steps, Adam stopped as a slight smile spread across his face.</p><br><p>“Is this it?” he asked, looking at the large, purple-dark building whose top resembled a slanted beak or a witch’s hat.</p><br><p>A few people were sitting at tables outside under an awning on the right, but most were inside, which was evident from the noise.</p><br><p>‘Yes. This is definitely the Raven Beak.’</p><br><p>“Good!” Adam exclaimed, heading for the doors. “Helasa, right? It’s time to meet her!”</p>
