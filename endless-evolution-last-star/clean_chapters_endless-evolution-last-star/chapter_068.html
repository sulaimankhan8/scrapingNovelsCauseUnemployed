            <br><p>"I heard there was a Second Rarity Level artifact in the anomaly cluster, you decided not to take it, didn't you?" Silvana asked quickly, trying not to delay the start of Adam's treatment.</p><br><br><p>"Good. In most cases, it's better to keep developing your artifact rather than start over with a new one. Anyway, Essence is the most important component to the evolution of an artifact, though, I think you already understand that." Silvana said seriously.</p><br><p>Adam only nodded once more, wanting to hear about where Essence could be obtained.</p><br><p>"Essence is obtained in about the same way as genes - through Revolve. However, to get Essence, you need to kill a special type of monster - the Essence Type."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide as the flames of battle ignited inside him. For some reason, he immediately wanted to fight this kind of monster even though he didn't know anything about them other than the name.</p><br><p>"Essence Type...? How strong are they? Are they stronger than Prime Type? Are they more dangerous than Crown Type?"</p><br><p>Silvana sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"It's difficult to answer this question because each Type has its own specific traits. Prime Type are the strongest of their species. Crown Type are fighters who survived hundreds of battles, perfect killing machines. Essence Type has done the same as most Phantoms, not counting the newcomers."</p><br><p>"Hmm? What are you talking about?" Adam raised an eyebrow with curiosity in his gaze.</p><br><p>Silvana pointed at him.</p><br><p>"Essence Monsters just like you absorbed the artifact."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>In each anomaly, there were special monsters that received part of the element from the anomaly and became anomalous ones.</p><br><p>However, the monsters did not absorb the artifacts, since the artifact was the center of the anomaly and released its energy to make its defenders stronger.</p><br><p>"Essence Monsters were strong enough that the artifact's energy didn't tear them apart. Moreover, the strength and sturdiness of the body alone weren't enough for that in their case. Monsters like the Essence Ones have an innate great control over energy, so they intuitively know how to subdue the artifact and use it if necessary."</p><br><p>Silvana continued, "The artifact quickly becomes one with the monster, then turns into a pure core of energy with a specific element, that's what we call - Essence."</p><br><br><p>"I see... The stronger I get, the harder it becomes to progress. Well, I guess it's only fair since strength can't be gained the easy way." Adam muttered, clenching his fists tightly.</p><br><br><p>"I have nothing more to add. I'll give you more details later. I've told you the basics. Can we finally get to work on your health?"</p><br><p>"Sure..." Adam yawned widely, "That's enough to..."</p><br><br><p>Adam passed out, falling to the ground.</p><br><p>"Adam!" Silvana exclaimed quickly catching him.</p><br><br><p>Scarlet River Squad had already dispersed, and she somehow needed to get Adam to Jena.</p><br><p>Sure, she could call for a car, but the nearest road was a few alleys away. Moreover, Adam's back had the Steel Knight's sword on it. He didn't feel it, but the sword weighed several dozens of kilograms, so... for Silvana, the total weight was unbearable.</p><br><p>'Damn. Even I wasn't prepared for this... Because you have to do everything in time and listen to your Operator!' Silvana inwardly complained, trying to think of what to do.</p><br><p>Then, a tall shadow with broad shoulders fell upon her.</p><br><p>Silvana raised her head as her eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"Do you need help?" Dargo asked, his arms crossed over his chest, "It's a rhetorical question, you don't need to answer."</p><br><p>Before Silvana could say anything, Dargo picked up Adam and headed forward.</p><br><p>"Thank you." Silvana said briefly.</p><br><br><p>"On this mission, he became a member of the Scarlet River Squad, so it's my duty as captain to take care of everyone."</p><br><p>Silvana nodded understandingly.</p><br><p>Soon, they reached the road, a car would be arriving soon, so Dargo and Silvana just waited.</p><br><p>Of the Citadel residents that passed by, some were department employees, and some were regular waiters or office clerks, but they all saw Adam's wounds, especially the wide cut on his back, and nodded deeply in respect.</p><br><p>Dargo and Silvana did not react in any way, for it was the Phantoms' duty to protect the Citadel, and thus its inhabitants.</p><br><p>"Operator." Dargo calmly said, addressing Silvana, not by her name but by her status, "You are lucky to have such a capable Phantom as Adam. You must make sure he can climb as high as possible and become one of the main forces of our Citadel in the future."</p><br><p>"Sure." Silvana quickly replied with sparkling eyes, "It's my duty, and I will do everything in my power to make even the wildest dream come true!"</p><br><p>"Good." Dargo nodded approvingly as a black car stopped in front of them.</p><br><br><p>For the next few hours, Jena did everything in her power to cure Adam as quickly as possible. The sooner she got rid of his wounds and possible scars, the better his condition would be.</p><br><p>At this time, Adam's mind wandered within his space.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree emitted a calm, white light that had a calming effect. His gaze traveled to his Nexus, gloves hovering amidst the void.</p><br><p>Adam smiled, besides developing the artifact, this was the last way he could become even stronger.</p><br><p>'What Zera did was definitely an ability of her Nexus, it was really powerful, and obviously, it wasn't First Trait but Second one... Hah, I wonder what I'll get when I obtain the genes then? I don't have much left.'</p><br><p>Then, Adam closed his eyes, completely falling into sleep, both physically and mentally.</p><br><br><p>"Jena, you did a magnificent job as always!" Adam said energetically, looking at his hands.</p><br><p>Jena smiled, fixing her hair, "I'm glad you liked it. I tried."</p><br><p>Adam, Jena, and Silvana walked down the streets in Third Ring, drinking coffee as many people passed by them. Coffee was the perfect drink to recover from something stressful, especially if someone was sharing this difficult time together.</p><br><p>"We should stop by my house." Silvana said suddenly, tossing the empty cup of coffee into the trash. Unlike Jena and Adam, this was already her third one.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Why?" Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>Silvana glanced at her phone and said, "Zera Cryen delivered your part of the loot to me. I decided it would be best if the artifacts weren't close to your family."</p><br><p>"Agh... I see." Adam nodded.</p><br><p>"By the way. I think it's about time you got your eye on a storage unit." Silvana suggested, "As time goes on, you'll have more and more artifacts, maybe monster parts or just rare items. It all needs to be stored somewhere, and home is definitely not the best place."</p><br><p>"Storage..." Adam muttered, remembering the sword of the Steel Knight and the engine of the Brass Puppet, "Yeah, that's a good idea, but first the artifacts!"</p><br><p>"Sure." Silvana smirked.</p><br><p>Adam didn't yet know how big a chunk of the mission reward Zera had decided to give him. It was a decision of the entire squad, though, and fully deserved because, without him, no one would return home.</p>
