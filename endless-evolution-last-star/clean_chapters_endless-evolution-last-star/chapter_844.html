            <br><p>Adam didn't know what was behind the orbs, but he understood what their purpose was - each of the orbs would make him stronger, in one way or another. There was no other way to be.</p><br><p>With a loud crack, the Zero Orb shattered, revealing the bright flare lurking within.</p><br><p>Before Adam could look at it, the flash flew forward, heading towards the Evolution Tree like a collapsed star.</p><br><p>Adam turned around sharply, trying to keep track of the unknown object.</p><br><p>Soon, he got the opportunity, for the flash stopped midway, between the Crystal Gates and the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>"That's..." Adam muttered, gazing into the layer of light.</p><br><p>The glass sphere floated amidst the darkness, white streams of energy raging inside in an endless cycle, each time taking on new, unique forms.</p><br><p>Adam did not know the purpose of the sphere, for some reason, it seemed familiar to him. He saw something similar many times, but not as majestic and free.</p><br><p>Then, Adam's eyes went wide when he got his first guess, a rather believable one.</p><br><p>"Wait... Is that a gene?"</p><br><p>As if waiting for Adam to guess everything, the Evolution Tree proclaimed:</p><br><p>[Yes, Adam... It's a new gene, a special one...]</p><br><p>Not affected by their conversation, the sphere slowly headed forward, eager to take its place at the center of Adam's power.</p><br><p>[I'm sure I wouldn't be wrong... If I say it's the second most important gene after the initial one...]</p><br><p>Shock covered Adam's face as his eyes traveled to the gruesome sword below - his Power Gene.</p><br><p>'The Evolution Tree isn't kidding?' Adam doubted, 'The force of my Power Gene is hard to control, but it's worth it... Am I about to get something more serious?'</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam was both right and wrong at the same time. He would soon find out, after all, the sphere was nearing the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>[Remember Adam... This serene, seemingly harmless sphere... is your Global Gene.]</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, the Global Gene slammed into the Evolution Tree with all its might, effortlessly shattering the tough, energy-infused bark.</p><br><p>The splinters flew aside, following a bright flash that traveled far beyond the tree. The blinding light wanted to reach the very limits of darkness, to make even the void in Adam's inner space aware of the new player.</p><br><p>The effect was great enough to escape into the real world.</p><br><p>Only for a moment, but Adam's tightly closed eyes flashed tightly as if his eyelids were trying to hide two burning suns, unsuccessfully.</p><br><p>Silvana and Douglas glanced at each other. She wanted answers, and he could help her with that.</p><br><p>His heavy hand fell on her shoulder, while his smile grew wider.</p><br><p>"Don't worry. Adam's fine - he just got stronger, and... next time he'll need your help."</p><br><br><p>While Silvana tried to make sense of Douglas's words, Adam watched his new gene.</p><br><p>The Global Gene took a place higher than the Initial Gene, it wasn't brazen enough to try and take over the main cell, but the Global Gene understood its importance.</p><br><p>A mechanical voice echoed in Adam's head:</p><br><p>[The Zero Orb has been broken, the first trial of the Crystal Gates passed, the Global Gene has been obtained.]</p><br><p>Silence reigned afterward, leaving Adam and the Evolution Tree alone.</p><br><p>"And..." Adam gulped, "What's the Global Gene doing? Why can't I feel anything?"</p><br><p>Every time Adam received a new gene, artifact, or nexus, he immediately knew what he was capable of. All the information he needed turned up within seconds.</p><br><p>If it was necessary, with the new knowledge, he could immediately rush into battle as it happened with his nexus.</p><br><p>However... Now, Adam felt nothing.</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree grumbled, its heavy voice echoing to the borders of the world.</p><br><p>[Adam... Let me ask you something... What are abilities... What do you think?]</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>Taking his time to answer, he rubbed his chin thoughtfully before waving his hand in his assumption:</p><br><p>"Well... It's energy that takes a certain form, with unique effects for each Phantom. I think that's the correct answer."</p><br><p>[Indeed... It is... But... Abilities have one global disadvantage - they are limited in quantity...]</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly. He didn't see anything strange about it, because no one could have an infinite number of abilities, neither monsters nor Phantoms. It was a truth that Adam was used to.</p><br><p>[However... Adam, do monsters have such limitations?]</p><br><p>"Monsters? Where are you going with this?"</p><br><p>[The Crimson Monarch... Sure, he had abilities like you, but... as opposed to you, he was free to control thunder or blood. The same is true for the Blind Sinner or even the Plague Reaper.]</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide in realization.</p><br><p>'If you think about it like that...' he muttered inwardly, 'The Evolution Tree's words make sense. Even if it's a weak White Threat monster, a fire one, then it can use its flames freely to burn enemies.'</p><br><p>'You don't need abilities for something so simple, you just need to have the right energy - a power by birthright.'</p><br><p>Then, Adam froze, remembering his fights and the battles of other Phantoms that he once watched.</p><br><p>'You can have five ice abilities, it doesn't let you use frost the way you want to... I guess that's one of the main differences in how Phantoms and monsters use their energy to fight.'</p><br><p>Adam's deep thoughts, brought him back to the Evolution Tree while the puzzles in his mind were slowly coming together.</p><br><p>[So... Adam, I see you've realized something... Go ahead... Use your Global Gene... Try to do what is the essence of your Initial Gene.]</p><br><p>In a deep voice, the Evolution Tree finally said:</p><br><p>[After all, you are a weaver, you were one... Now... What is your attribute?]</p><br><p>"My attribute...?" Adam muttered, looking at his hands.</p><br><p>Though he had threads and the weaver gene he didn't use that power to connect anything - he only did one thing:</p><br><br><p>As soon as that thought entered his mind, the Global Gene shuddered.</p><br><p>Then, Adam's eyes reflected a myriad of tiny stars - his energy floating before him and ready to be freely used, in the form he needed.</p>
