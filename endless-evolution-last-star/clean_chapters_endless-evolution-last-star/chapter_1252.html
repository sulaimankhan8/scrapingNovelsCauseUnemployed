            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1252: Sword and the Eyes (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>The Red Bloom used all the resources she had to protect the last crystal. Sure, at the same time, she tried to restore the destroyed crystals as quickly as possible, but that took time.</p><br><p>Her chances of winning depended on whether she could delay Adam’s team for a few minutes or not. The less energy Adam and the others had, the better it was for Red Bloom.</p><br><p>She was sure that by putting all her available energy into the barrier and summoning four bloom guards, she would be able to delay Adam, Garrah, the Thorn Hunter, and the Dark Blobs for at least five minutes.</p><br><p>Perhaps that would have actually happened, but Garrah and Adam had a different opinion on the matter.</p><br><p>The dark roots controlled by Garrah grasped the four guards, preventing them from escaping. They tried to tear and cut the roots, but Garrah continued to create new ones, as he understood that he could not allow the bloom guards to interfere with Adam.</p><br><p>Adam did not move; he did not create the path as he had done before.</p><br><p>Now he had a different plan, and Silvana was always there to help him carry it out.</p><br><p>The Dark Blobs split into twelve parts as before, their eyes wide as they stared at the outline of the great scissors hovering in front of Adam.</p><br><br><p>“Scissors! They’re scissors!”</p><br><p>“I see…! But…! Hurry, the old man doesn’t have much strength left.”</p><br><p>The Thorn Hunter said nothing, he just looked at Adam and nodded deeply. Their plan’s success or failure would depend on Adam’s next attack.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam was the only one who wasn’t worried.</p><br><p>He had used the Imaginary Cut enough times to understand the full power of this ability. Moreover, after he created the First Grand Star, his power had increased, and he could feel it.</p><br><p>‘Hah, it’s not just my energy, but her aura too…’ Adam muttered to himself as he looked at Silvana to his left.</p><br><p>Silvana gently ran her hand over his chest as they simultaneously grabbed the handles of the scissors.</p><br><p>“Go ahead, one cut, and it will all be over. The Red Bloom… Her barriers are quite strong, we cannot deny that. But that is no obstacle for us in any way.”</p><br><p>There was nothing more to add as Adam nodded and their hands moved, causing the great scissors to close.</p><br><p>Under the watchful eyes of the monsters, both Garrah’s squad and others who had joined them at the last crystal, a bright flash lit up the forest.</p><br><p>In the blink of an eye, a vertical cut crossed dozens of meters, slicing the dense red barrier in two, as well as the crystal hidden inside.</p><br><p>The Red Bloom’s eyes widened in disbelief as the cut continued, slicing through numerous trees and rocks in its path. Even the thickest roots and stones could not stop the cut.</p><br><p>With a calm expression, Adam let go of his hand, watching the red shards fall to the ground from the broken crystal.</p><br><p>An energy pulse ran through the main root, returning to the Red Bloom as several layers of her inner barrier disappeared, leaving only a dense orb around the bud.</p><br><p>The Dark Blobs exchanged glances before jumping for joy.</p><br><br><p>“Yes! We destroyed all the crystals!”</p><br><p>“Let’s kill that bitch!”</p><br><br><p>The other monsters, though not as frenzied as the Dark Blobs, fully supported their mood.</p><br><p>No one wanted to see an outsider on their territory, especially one like the Red Bloom, who had come here only to drain their lands, leaving them without even a drop of energy.</p><br><p>Sure, after they dealt with the Red Bloom, they would continue to compete with each other and fight for resources, but that was fair and the life they were used to.</p><br><p>The Red Bloom made a big mistake by making all the monsters of the dark forest her enemies.</p><br><p>“Great… We did it…” The Thorn Hunter exhaled cold breath as he looked around.</p><br><p>Garrah nodded deeply. “Yes, but we must not relax. The Red Bloom is still a dangerous enemy. Moreover, we still have to break her last barrier, and it will take a lot of strength.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam turned to Garrah.</p><br><p>“Do you want me to do it? I think I have enough strength for one more cut like that.”</p><br><p>At first, when Adam didn’t know about the dark forest situation, he didn’t want to waste a lot of energy trying to get out of there.</p><br><p>However, now he realized that wasn’t an option. If he held back, he wouldn’t defeat the Red Bloom and would only suffer serious injuries. It wasn’t the best tactic, considering he needed to get to the Glass Bridge and the Forgotten Mills.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Garrah shook his head.</p><br><p>“No, we need your energy. You and I will fight the Red Bloom together. These two will take care of the last barrier.” He pointed at the Dark Blobs and the Thorn Hunter.</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam raised an eyebrow, puzzled.</p><br><p>Garrah nodded. “Yes, they may not be as good at destroying barriers as you are, but that was part of our plan even before you showed up. And… I’ll be honest… Among all of us, you are the strongest.”</p><br><br><p>“Hah, thanks, it’s always nice to hear praise. My Operator has almost never been enough for me, you know?”</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Silvana appeared next to Adam with a great frown, scaring even the monsters around them.</p><br><p>“WHAT? I am praising you! I just don’t always say it!”</p><br><p>“Pffft, that means you’re not praising me, right?”</p><br><p>Silvana’s face twitched. If she could, she would have strangled Adam.</p><br><p>Garrah awkwardly scratched the back of his head. “Hahaha, I’m sure she appreciates you more than anyone else.”</p><br><br><p>“Ahem. Let’s move on. Our next target is the Red Bloom. Only when it dies will our forest and we be free, otherwise, we will become another scorched territory.”</p><br><p>The monsters nodded and moved together toward the center of the forest, relying not only on their own strength, but also on the abilities of the young Phantom who literally fell from the sky.</p>
