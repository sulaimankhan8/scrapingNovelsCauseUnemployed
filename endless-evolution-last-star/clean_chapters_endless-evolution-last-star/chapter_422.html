            <br><p>"What about this?" Adam asked picking up a package of expensive ground meat, it was large, enough to make a hearty lasagna that a family of four would eat all day.</p><br><p>"Oh, Adam, are you sure...?" Leona asked, feeling awkward, "I'm a little embarrassed that I brought you here, to an expensive store, but... I don't want to force you to buy such overpriced ingredients."</p><br><p>Adam smiled weakly. Before Leona could say anything, he threw two packages of ground meat into the cart, even though they only needed one.</p><br><p>"What...?" Leona looked at Adam in confusion.</p><br><p>Adam approached her with a kind smile.</p><br><p>"I want so much meat this time so that next time I'll ask to add less, okay?"</p><br><p>Adam said before picking up the cart and heading on his way.</p><br><p>Leona blinked a few times before nodding and following him. She wasn't stupid and realized that Adam as the Phantom had enough money to buy anything in this store, but... she as his mother couldn't force him. He was her son and she wanted only the best for him.</p><br><p>'Well, if that's his wish, then I can't stand in the way of that. Moreover, the better the ingredients, the better, isn't it? Leona inwardly muttered.</p><br><p>It felt warm on her chest as every time she saw her son again he was getting more mature and confident, it couldn't help but make her feel good.</p><br><p>"Hey, we got the meat and lasagna sheets, what's next on the list?" Adam asked, turning around and looking at Leona over his shoulder.</p><br><p>Leona walked over to him and glancing to the side said: "We have a lot more things to buy, but why not continue with cheese? I know you've always missed it, now, we can drown the lasagna in cheese if that's what you want."</p><br><p>Adam grinned widely, he understood Leona's train of thought.</p><br><p>"Hah, good idea. Well, let's get to the choices. There are different sizes, hardnesses, and flavors of cheese, I think we're sure to find something suitable."</p><br><br><p>"Weapons...? I have to choose a weapon?" Glara asked, glancing at Gladius and Aiden.</p><br><p>Aiden didn't answer anything, he just took the tablet in his hands, looking at Glara's metrics, he pondered on which monster she should come out against if she wanted to win.</p><br><p>Gladius turned to Glara with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Yes, weapons come in many forms, differing in shape, material as well as purpose, but I'm sure you will find something suitable."</p><br><p>Then, Gladius stepped forward with a wave of his hand.</p><br><p>"Come on, follow me. Once you've decided on a weapon, then you'll fight the monster. Hah, it may be one of the last choices of your life, who knows."</p><br><p>Glara gulped and quickly followed him.</p><br><p>Sano and Natta turned around, about to join them, but...</p><br><p>Aiden waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Natta, you stay here. Sano, you can leave."</p><br><p>"Sure." Natta obediently nodded, turning back.</p><br><br><p>The door closed as Gladius, Glara, and Sano left, leaving only Aiden and Natta in the room.</p><br><p>Natta couldn't help it as she felt the oppressive atmosphere. It wasn't her first day working at Morton Observatory and she had her own reasons for being here, but even after a long time, she couldn't get used to the feeling of constant threat coming from Aiden.</p><br><p>'Damn, it's not like I have the toughest job in the world, but why am I under more stress here than when I worked for the military department?' Natta internally shook her head, standing still behind Aiden like a guard.</p><br><p>Then, Aiden broke the silence:</p><br><p>"While Glara was being examined you managed to talk a bit, didn't you?"</p><br><p>But, Natta didn't have time to answer, it was a rhetorical question.</p><br><p>"Tell me about her. What did you manage to understand about Glara as a person? You're a good judge of character."</p><br><br><p>"Sure. I didn't have much time, but I don't think she's as kind and naive as her brother, Lero Fratto, based on the information I have on him. She has determination and she has a strong desire to continue her brother's path, but... I'm afraid she could easily break down if she fails."</p><br><p>Aiden sighed slightly, the tips of his white hair swept in front of his deep amber eyes.</p><br><p>"I see. That's something to work with, though these musings are premature. She needs to kill the monster first."</p><br><p>"Excuse me, can I ask you something?" Natta said uncertainly.</p><br><p>"Go ahead." Aiden lightly shook his hand, giving her permission.</p><br><p>"What's the point of all this? I mean, let's say she kills the monster and becomes a Natural Phantom, but what does that give us? Whether she gained inner space because of a series of unique events or not, none of this matters since the result if she wins is the same." Natta voiced her opinion.</p><br><p>She knew the difference between Natural and Artificial Phantoms as well as what one needed to do to become first or second.</p><br><p>"I understand what you're getting at, but that's why we're dedicating so much time to Glara. If there's no uniqueness in the appearance of an inner space without the Spark, then we'll know about it and won't waste any more time on it."</p><br><p>Aiden raised his head, looking up at the ceiling while his bright eyes grew deeper.</p><br><p>"But... if the inner space without the Spark has some kind of specialty, it could help with my research or even be a new step for humanity in general."</p><br><p>Aiden threw one leg over the other, leaning back in his chair.</p><br><p>"That's what science is all about, especially in our cruel unexplored world. You're supposed to notice anomalies and oddities, do experiments in the hope that soon something will work out and it will prove useful."</p><br><p>Aiden took a deep breath and his gaze grew heavier.</p><br><p>"You can believe it or not, but most of the first discoveries of great things happened that way, attention, chance, and a little luck - that's the recipe for science."</p><br><p>Natta's eyes went wide for a moment as she nodded silently. She got a much better answer than she expected.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Gladius, Sano, and Glara entered a spacious room that held all sorts of weapons.</p><br><p>There was everything a military or experienced fighter could think of and even much more.</p><br><p>From simple blades and swords to axes, hammers, and katanas. There were also guns: assault rifles, machine guns, and shotguns, but strangely enough, there were no grenades, mines, or explosives, not even one.</p><br><p>Moreover, swords like all other weapons here were not ordinary. It wasn't a hilt with strong hardened steel, as the blade was equipped with a laser fueled by a generator inside the hilt.</p><br><p>This did not interact with the monster's genes in any way, so a person could use it and become a Natural Phantom if they won. Sure, it increased the odds only slightly, but it was better to have something when either death or a new life was at stake.</p><br><p>"Wow... I didn't even realize there were so many types of weapons..." Glara gasped in a daze, hesitantly taking a few steps forward.</p><br><br><p>"I ironically call this place the death store. Sure, you don't buy anything here, but the weapon you choose could cost you your life, so think carefully about your choice."</p><br><p>Glara gulped as she stepped forward, looking around.</p><br><p>'A weapon... right? It's going to be a hard decision...'</p>
