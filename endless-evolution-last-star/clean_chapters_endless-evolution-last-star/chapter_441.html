            <br><p>The benefits of Code D were coming to an end, not because the effects of the drug had worn off so quickly, but because Glara's body was at its limit.</p><br><p>Her skin was wrinkled, looking pulled and dry, as if she were a middle-aged woman, rapidly approaching her old age.</p><br><p>It affected her muscles and body condition as well, she could no longer act as fast and flexible as she had at the beginning of the fight, but there was no need to.</p><br><p>The Redcore Wolf was at his border as well as she was. All they had to do to win was to make one attack.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the Redcore Wolf appeared in front of Glara, his jaw was wide open, ready to sink his sharp fangs right into Glara's flesh.</p><br><p>"Good... This is roughly how I imagined it."</p><br><p>Glara muttered with a weak look before extending her left arm forward. She had a shield on her left arm, but she didn't try to defend herself. She realized that she didn't have the time or strength to do so, the Redcore Wolf would simply rip her arm off along with the shield.</p><br><p>Instead of blocking the attack, Glara simply threw the shield right into the Redcore Wolf's jaw.</p><br><p>The shield's blades were no longer spinning as well as the plasma cover, so the Redcore Wolf didn't even try to dodge.</p><br><p>He realized that now this shield was nothing more than a piece of solid iron, which was no problem for his powerful jaws.</p><br><br><p>His jaws closed, breaking the shield in half, realizing that he needed another move, the Redcore Wolf opened his jaw, about to close it again to completely destroy the shield.</p><br><p>"Oh, not bad, not bad at all." Gladius smirked, watching Glara's actions.</p><br><br><p>Before the Redcore Wolf could close its jaw once more, Glara extended her right arm forward, thrusting her shotgun straight into the monster's maw.</p><br><p>The Redcore Wolf realized the danger as he hastened to stop, afraid of damaging the shotgun, which, unlike the shield, still had energy in it.</p><br><p>But, it was too late.</p><br><p>To get out of the attack range, the Redcore Wolf needed to make a lot of moves at a speed that was beyond his capabilities.</p><br><p>Glara, on the other hand, simply needed to pull the trigger.</p><br><br><p>She did it, causing the shotgun to shudder, firing its last charge outward.</p><br><p>There was real fear in the Redcore Wolf's eyes, coming from the depths of his heart. He hadn't expected Glara to be so bold and risky as to decide to stick her hand right into his mouth, between his sharp fangs.</p><br><p>He just didn't realize that Glara was in an even more desperate position than the Redcore Wolf, as she only had a few seconds to live.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A purple blast like the flame of a star, burst from the double-barreled muzzle, illuminating the entire room for a moment.</p><br><br><p>The Redcore Wolf's head exploded into shards of flesh, flying apart, some of the flesh chunks containing shards from the shield that was destroyed by the blast as well.</p><br><p>Glara had never seen such a bloody and gruesome scene before, not even online.</p><br><p>Now, it was all happening right in front of her eyes, at arm's length. She could see the nerves and bones protruding outward from the monster's neck, flesh scattered on the ground, fangs and eyes.</p><br><p>Half of her body was covered in the monster's strong-smelling blood, but her gaze was peaceful and devastated.</p><br><p>Her mind didn't care about what she had done or how gruesome a picture it was, for she was dying, right now.</p><br><p>Sano and Natta glanced over at each other. They, like everyone else, had no choice but to watch.</p><br><p>No medical supplies or technology was capable of saving a person after the use of Code D. As Aiden said earlier, the only way to survive was to become a Phantom.</p><br><br><p>Aiden narrowed his eyes and squeezed Shiny's crystal with force to ensure that he didn't miss a single moment. The Spark Seeker flinched slightly but didn't bother Aiden, it was dangerous, especially when Aiden was so focused.</p><br><br><p>Like a shadow, Gladius appeared beside him, who silently stood on Shiny's right side, looking at Glara through the black glass crystal.</p><br><p>Less than a second later, everyone saw a bright flash appear in the darkness.</p><br><p>Glara was lucky and became a Phantom, she got the Spark, though she had a 10% chance of dying a mere human. At least that was Aiden's opinion.</p><br><p>The nature of the Spark was that when it appeared it was a faint light, but the Spark was only in that state for one millisecond.</p><br><p>The next thing that happened was the monster's genes were absorbed, led by the main gene that would become the Initial Gene of the Phantom.</p><br><p>At this point the genes acted as embers, they were the fuel that gave off their energy for the Spark to flare up as much as possible as the Spark could only grow for the first second of its appearance, after which it would maintain its current power.</p><br><p>This was the reason why people who had naturally developed the Spark could not become the Naturalborn Phantom.</p><br><p>Their Spark couldn't grow to the point where the person would become the Naturalborn Phantom, as that required 100% pure monster genes at the time of the Spark's appearance.</p><br><p>Unfortunately for Glara, this was not an option for her, since the Redcore Wolf's genes headed to her Spark along with a small amount of Sano and Natta's genes.</p><br><p>Gladius and Aiden could see this clearly, thanks to the crystal of the Spark Seeker.</p><br><p>The genes as tiny stars headed towards Glara, who fell to her knees, seeing only death facing her.</p><br><p>Some of the stars, about 1/10th of the total, were slightly larger than the others, as along with them were another's genes, Sano and Natta's genes.</p><br><p>All of them strived to the Spark, wanting to fill it with energy. Usually, in such cases, the Spark would accept the pure genes while the not 100% pure genes were left behind.</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" Aiden muttered seeing the astonishing scene, something that had never happened before.</p><br><p>Some of the stars stopped in one place.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, they were all that 1/10, those big and tainted genes. The dense darkness that was Glara's inner space just wouldn't let them in.</p><br><p>Then, the darkness spread a little further, touching the big stars like a black fog.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the large stars shuddered, splitting into genes, some were Sano and Natta's, and others were 100% pure the Redcore Wolf's genes.</p><br><p>Then, the Redcore Wolf's genes moved on, the inner space no longer blocking their path, allowing only the 100% pure genes to head towards the Spark.</p><br><p>Gladius's eyes went wide for a moment, he hadn't expected to see something completely new today.</p><br><p>"I figured it out right, didn't I? I can trust my eyes, isn't it?"</p><br><p>Aiden nodded with a deep look.</p><br><p>"Yes... Apparently, because she had the inner space before the Spark appeared, her inner space had time to prepare and adapt to the coming situation. It blocked the entrance for unnecessary genes, leaving only the Redcore Wolf's genes."</p><br><p>Aiden shifted his gaze to Glara whose eyes shone brightly, energy actively filling her body.</p><br><p>"Moreover, the inner space separated the dirty genes, making them pure. Oh... just now, I've added a whole mountain of work."</p><br><p>Then, Glara instinctively raised her hand and summoned the Revolve.</p><br><p>Experience more on empire</p><br><p>Aiden lifted his chin before uttering as if it were the law.</p><br><p>"Thanks to that feature, she will become none other than the Naturalborn Phantom."</p>
