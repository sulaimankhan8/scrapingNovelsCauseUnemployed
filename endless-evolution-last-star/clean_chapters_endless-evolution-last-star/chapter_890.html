            <br><p>With the wind flowing, Leira and the rest of the nobles had to accept reality as it was - Erik Wurhen had come and stolen Adam and Reinz, then disappeared without a trace.</p><br><p>Leira held one of the highest positions in the Alderran Family. After all, she was a K4-Phantom who was on the frontier of evolution of the First Circle, between her and any other K4-Phantom was a great difference.</p><br><p>However, she couldn't do anything to a man with power like Erik.</p><br><p>If he wanted to, he could break into the Alderran Family's territory, kill her, and calmly walk out.</p><br><p>Sure, in the near future, the wrath of the entire Alderran Family would fall upon him, their head would appear and then Erik would find himself in a difficult situation.</p><br><p>But, he had no reason to do something so crazy.</p><br><p>After all, he just wanted to save Adam. Reinz? Well, he took them both for curiosity's sake.</p><br><p>Leira clenched her fist tightly, a great grimace on her face.</p><br><p>"Damn it! What's that drunkard even doing here? Fucking the Wurhen Family!" Leira spat out before looking at Andreas, "You! Reinforce the barrier at the Twilight Palace and oversee the repair of all the damage!"</p><br><p>She waved her hand irritably.</p><br><p>"This kind of thing can't happen again! Never!"</p><br><p>Not wanting to escalate the situation, Andreas only bowed low, "Sure. It will be done as you say Ms. Leira."</p><br><p>She snorted, before striding off in the direction of their family's palace.</p><br><p>At the Twilight Palace, Andreas was in charge, but he dared not disrespect Leira, in her own family's territory.</p><br><p>But... Andreas couldn't help but glance to the side.</p><br><p>'Hmm... I wonder what Mr. Erik is planning to do. Everyone who knows him is aware that he's a big fan of betting, but was that the only reason why he saved Adam?'</p><br><br><p>Adam and Reinz were exhausted, so they didn't realize when they passed out.</p><br><p>Did it happen when Erik touched them or maybe after the race?</p><br><p>It didn't matter as Adam and Reinz got their well-deserved sleep.</p><br><p>The final battle was complete with Adam's victory, this was obvious after their last clash.</p><br><p>For this reason, the stakes were settled, money and territories were paid out and the name of the Adam Vinter was once again heard in the noble society.</p><br><br><p>Adam slowly opened his eyes, he could smell the odor of freshly brewed coffee moving straight to his nose.</p><br><p>The first thing he saw was some round white speaker-like object right in front of his face.</p><br><p>Before he could realize anything, someone shouted into a megaphone with all their might:</p><br><p>"WAKE UP! TWO LITTLE BASTARDS!"</p><br><p>Like thunder, Adam and Reinz woke up. Instinctively they bounced back and prepared to fight.</p><br><p>They looked around to realize what was happening, while the wild ringing continued to buzz in their ears. If they were mere humans, something so loud would have made their ears bleed from blown eardrums.</p><br><p>In front of them, they saw a tall girl with red spiky hair and black eyes. She was dressed like a street thug or more like a biker, leather jacket, high boots, and exposed body parts covered in a black net.</p><br><p>Also, tattoos and piercings were nothing new to her.</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" Adam muttered.</p><br><p>"Who are you?" Reinz asked, remaining calm, "And... Where are we?"</p><br><p>Soon, they spotted a lone silhouette off to the side.</p><br><p>Erik sat at a round wooden table, enjoying coffee and seemingly only baked desserts.</p><br><p>Despite the ringing from the megaphone shaking the windows and the situation in general, Erik remained unconcerned.</p><br><p>He didn't look at Adam and Reinz, continuing to drink his black coffee in slow sips. The light rays of sunlight falling across his shoulders showed that it was early morning.</p><br><p>The girl tossed aside the megaphone and placed her hands at her sides, glaring menacingly at Adam and Reinz.</p><br><p>"My name is Julia, but that's not what's important right now. What's mattered is that you two have slept too long!"</p><br><p>"Argh?" Adam was confused, "I mean we were kidnapped..."</p><br><p>Reinz nodded in confirmation.</p><br><p>"More to the point, Julia?" Adam raised an eyebrow, "That's too gentle a name for a beast like you!"</p><br><p>Reinz nodded again several times. He was in agreement with every Adam's word.</p><br><p>A formidable grimace covered the girl's face. She was about to say something, but at that moment Erik's voice rang out.</p><br><p>"Ah, Julia, your desserts are beautiful as always." Erik took a bite from a cupcake, removing the crumbs from his lips with a white napkin.</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz glanced around, they didn't know what to expect. At least Julia would respond rudely to Erik.</p><br><p>But... instead, she rushed towards him with eyes full of love and courtesy. She leaned over the table, lightly rubbing her folded palms together and wiggling her butt with excitement.</p><br><p>"Really? I'm so glad you liked it!" Julia exclaimed seeming to get red hearts in her eyes, "Next time I'll make two, no! Three times as much! As much as you'll need!"</p><br><p>Confusion was reflected on Adam and Reinz's faces.</p><br><p>They didn't know what they were more surprised about: Julia's behavior in front of Erik or the fact that a girl like her could bake?</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam realized something important.</p><br><p>'Agh... I see... So... Is this what his Operator looks like?' his eyes grew deeper intently studying the aura emanating from Julia, the crimson mist, light, and shivering coming out of her body.</p><br><p>Earlier it was unnoticeable, but as soon as Erik complimented Julia's desserts, she lost her composure and her aura seeped out.</p><br><p>However, Erik's aura remained calm.</p><br><p>'No, not like that.' Adam watched Erik who maintained his equanimity in every situation, 'I don't sense anything from him at all. It's like his aura doesn't exist.'</p><br><p>Nothing was coming from Erik. If not for Adam's instincts and his familiarity with Erik, he would have thought that the man in front of him was a simple man without a single drop of energy.</p><br><p>Reinz noticed it too.</p><br><p>'What a fabulous energy control...' he gulped, 'Compared to him, my energy is like a wild flame in the middle of the darkness.'</p><br><br><p>Erik put the cup down on the saucer before finally looking at Adam and Reinz.</p><br><p>"Julia, please don't be so hard on them. Adam and Reinz are my good guests."</p><br><p>Julia stopped circling around Erik as she received a baffled look.</p><br><p>"But... Shouldn't we...?"</p><br><p>Before she could finish her sentence, Erik took her by the chin and kissed her deeply. A shiver went through Julia's body as she waved her hands trying to resist, but gave up after a second, melting at the sensation.</p><br><p>"F-Fine..." she muttered, her voice trembling.</p><br><p>Then, she arrogantly raised her head and crossed her arms over her chest, "But! Only because you asked!"</p><br><br><p>"Sure, be so kind. Bring the guys your desserts as well, I think they can appreciate them as much as I can," he smiled weakly, "Over a cup of coffee."</p><br><p>Julia snorted irritably, blowing on her long bang falling over her face, but she didn't refuse him.</p><br><p>Moreover, as soon as she moved far enough away, she clutched her cheeks and her face turned as red as a tomato, stars shining in her black eyes.</p><br><p>Erik cast a quick glance at her and shook his head. This wasn't the first or even the hundredth time he'd faced this.</p><br><p>Like Adam's relationship with Silvana, Erik, and Julia was not just about a working partnership.</p><br><p>'It happens more and more often...' Adam muttered inwardly.</p><br><p>In a few minutes, they were all at a table full of desserts and coffee.</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz sat across from Erik, while Julia was next to him snuggling tightly.</p><br><p>"So..." Reinz started first, "Mr. Erik, why did you bring us here? Furthermore... where are we?"</p><br><p>Erik took a short sip, "To answer your questions: we're at my house, well... in one of them. About why I brought you here... Hm... It wasn't in my plans, originally."</p><br><p>"But, when I saw what your fight turned into, I realized that it wouldn't be a minute before the elders of the Alderran Family turned Adam to ash. This prompted me to rush to your aid."</p><br><p>Taking his time with his story, Erik took another sip.</p><br><p>"I don't know if the 'others' were watching your fight, but it's a good thing I got there in time."</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz exchanged a glance. On some level what Erik had said was obvious. Reinz wanted to know what he was doing here.</p><br><p>"During my brief conversation with Leira, I realized that you two have become much stronger than the last time we met. Also... I know what you both want, and I'm willing to offer you a deal you can refuse but wouldn't want to."</p><br><p>Now, Adam and Reinz were interested.</p><br><p>This brought a sly smile to Julia's face, it seemed she knew what Erik was going to talk about.</p><br><p>"Well." Erik sighed, "Since this whole situation has happened I want you both to open the second lesser gates. Under my supervision."</p><br><p>"Reinz, we'll start with you. If you can do it in one week, I'll talk to the right people and get you on Heaven Island, straight to the Void Lake."</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Reinz's eyes went wide in disbelief, but Erik wasn't going to explain anymore, instead, he pointed at Adam.</p><br><p>"The same goes for yourself Adam, seven days and I'll help you go down to the Lower Ring. You've wanted to go there for a long time, haven't you?"</p>
