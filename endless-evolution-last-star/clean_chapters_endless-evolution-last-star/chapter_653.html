            <br><p>Abel gulped, glaring at Silvana. She was his ally not only as his mate but also as a fellow Phantom, yet for a moment he felt scared, a chill ran down his spine.</p><br><p>He realized that if Silvana decided to fight him seriously and he didn't know about this ability, it would all be over after one attack.</p><br><br><p>Quickly tearing down the steep wall instead of taking a long jump, Talna joined them. Silvana stared intently ahead, the anxiety within her causing her to act more cautiously than usual.</p><br><p>She didn't know if there were others with this Elite Obsidian Lizard, or what monsters awaited them ahead, but she could always be careful.</p><br><p>Talna appeared behind her, a sly grin on her face like a child ready to do some mischief and enjoy it to the fullest.</p><br><br><p>Her small hands squeezed Silvana's ass with complete insolence. The first thing Silvana thought was that Talna had accidentally hit her, but...</p><br><p>Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze.</p><br><p>Talna wasn't going to stop, her movements only got rougher and more confident as did the smirk on her face.</p><br><p>Continue your saga on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Hehehe, bitch, not only do you have hills on top, but you have such delicious buns underneath. I'm sure whoever gets them will be beyond happy."</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Silvana's face turned as red as a tomato from the surging wave of vivid shame. Then, embarrassment changed to anger.</p><br><p>"You! I'm going to kill you right here and now!"</p><br><p>Silvana exclaimed sharply turning around and swinging her sword, aiming straight for Talna's neck. Talna's playful expression quickly changed to a calm one as she bounced back, her eyes downcast watching the black broad blade fly a few centimeters from her pale skin.</p><br><p>Talna rolled her eyes, throwing her head back.</p><br><p>"Oh, come on! How old are you? Are you really still embarrassed by jokes like that?"</p><br><p>Silvana gritted her teeth, anger, and embarrassment mixed into a single emotion.</p><br><p>"Fuck you! It's one thing to say something and another to touch without permission! Don't you dare touch me again! Moreover, we're here on a mission! You should be more serious!"</p><br><p>Talna remained silent with a calm face, she seemed to accept Silvana's words, but... soon she had another idea on how to piss Silvana off.</p><br><p>"Hah... So if I had your permission, you'd be okay with it?"</p><br><p>There was no reply, only the tense atmosphere became even thicker, and... it couldn't stop Talna in any way.</p><br><p>"By the way... What about your Operator? I think his name is Adam Vinter... I've seen his photos. He's so handsome, does he have your permission?"</p><br><p>Abel reached forward, wanting to stop Talna since she went too far and from joking it could turn into a conflict. Though, he could hardly affect her even if he dared to say anything.</p><br><p>Spreading her fingers apart and bringing her palm closer to her mouth, Talna pulled her tongue out.</p><br><p>"Oh, don't you think so? Maybe I should text him then? I just like guys taller than me..."</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, a shadow towered over Talna exuding nothing but cold anger. The black blades stopped a millimeter from her neck, the sharp edges slicing her skin, releasing lonely trickles of blood.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes were dark, full of a cruel gloom that silenced Talna at last.</p><br><p>"One more word about my Operator and... I will sacrifice the success of the mission, but I will silence you, forever..."</p><br><p>Though Abel watched from afar, his face as pale as a sheet of paper, he realized that Silvana was deadly serious about every word she said.</p><br><p>Well, there was nothing of the sort on Talna's face. She merely shrugged before somehow disappearing from beneath the blades clutched at her neck and appearing a few meters ahead.</p><br><p>"Pffft! You're just a coward! Fine, I won't mess with you anymore, we have work ahead of us."</p><br><p>This time, Silvana didn't bother to reply anything. She only bit her lip and gripped her swords tighter.</p><br><p>She had felt anger towards Talna before, but now... there was only disappointment in herself inside.</p><br><br><p>After going through several passages and killing ten more Obsidian Lizards, including the two Elite ones, they reached the center of the second level.</p><br><p>Abel's eyes went wide looking at the wide area from the narrow passage.</p><br><p>"What the hell...? I thought there were only lizards and such here..."</p><br><p>Sweesh. Sweeesh. Sweesh.</p><br><p>A multitude of long legs ran from one side to the other, carrying bits of energy crystals in their powerful jaws.</p><br><p>The huge spiders each had eight legs, working for the good of their nest, wanting their new offspring to be born as soon as possible from massive cocoons of dense webbing.</p><br><p>Each spider had eight violet eyes, and their bodies were covered in thin stone armor, giving them protection and not limiting their mobility. Some of the spiders had a purple crystal on their backsides, the same as the Elite Obsidian Lizard, indicating their higher status.</p><br><p>The cocoons were placed next to the stone peaks, a few of each, the cocoons contained large purple eggs, with pulsating blood vessels coming out of the eggs and heading towards the carefully left pieces of energy crystals.</p><br><br><p>One of the spiders approached the cocoon, there were several gray debris lying near the lower egg, it had already absorbed all the energy from them. The spider lifted its two front legs, tossed the depleted shards aside, and replaced them with new, energy-rich pieces.</p><br><p>Silvana's heavy gaze stopped on one spider:</p><br><p>"Looks like we got here just in time. However, this is only the second level, so it's not our main target."</p><br><p>'Yeah.; Adam nodded, 'You can consider this your side mission since you'll still have to go through them to reach the depths of the caves. These are Obsidian Spiders, and as you can see, there are Elite ones among them as well, just like the lizards.'</p><br><p>Silvana nodded and gestured for Abel to go forward.</p><br><p>"Good, there are quite a few of them, they are spiders after all, but they don't look quite as strong as the lizards."</p><br><p>Then, Silvana's eyes dipped lower, feeling the anxiety inside her grow stronger each time they descended further.</p><br><p>'I know our purpose, but... Why am I so worried? And, what was that strange voice yesterday morning?'</p>
