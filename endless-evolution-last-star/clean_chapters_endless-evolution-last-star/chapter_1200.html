            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1200: This is Shame (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Adam didn’t know what kind of monster was heading their way. He had some ideas as soon as the storm started, and his theory was pretty much confirmed when the storm got stronger after they found the entrance to the Kirani Colony.</p><br><p>With each Kirani Bug defeated, Adam felt the enemy’s aura getting closer.</p><br><p>It seemed like good news to him. Everyone who knew Adam even a little knew that he loved to fight. In many ways, it was his passion and desire.</p><br><p>He couldn’t imagine anything better than fighting a worthy opponent, be it the Essence Thunder Demon, the Plague Reaper, or the Crimson Monarch of Arnoth. All of them were worthy of remaining in Adam’s memory forever.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam wasn’t always like that.</p><br><p>For most of his life, he didn’t have the opportunity to fight monsters. When fights broke out in the slums against other teenagers, Adam didn’t get any pleasure from it, not even any positive emotions.</p><br><p>It only gave him useful experience and helped build his character, which played a big role in many things in the future, there was no doubt about that. He did it out of necessity, not because he wanted to smash someone’s face in with his fists.</p><br><p>But when he became the Phantom and faced worthy opponents for the first time, many of whom even showed a shred of nobility, his opinion changed.</p><br><p>True, in most cases, Adam fought other monsters because it was necessary for the mission, for evolution, or simply for survival, but these were not the battles he remembered.</p><br><p>Over time, there would only be more of these nameless battles in his history. It was an inevitable and normal process, not only for him but for every Phantom.</p><br><p>However, Adam always had a goal.</p><br><p>He had to defeat the Crimson Monarch to evolve, defeating the Plague Reaper led him to the Midnight Crystal, the Essence Thunder Demon gave him a new ability, and the battle against Arnoth ultimately led him to the Dark Shore.</p><br><p>Now, however, the situation was different.</p><br><p>He had arrived at the Corrupted Volcano to obtain the Twilight Crystal. This was one of the conditions for his initial star in the Path Construct.</p><br><p>Moreover, in addition to finding the Twilight Crystal, he received some useful advice from his former rival, Fromund. Their conversation at the beginning had a strong positive influence on Adam.</p><br><br><p>He didn’t expect it to be her, but it didn’t matter much.</p><br><p>He had no reason to fight her. They already had two of the four Twilight Crystals, which were enough to successfully complete their mission and return to the Bastion Opard.</p><br><p>But Bathild had one chance to spark Adam’s interest. She had to give Adam some motivation to see her in the same light as Arnoth or the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>Perhaps Bathild’s title had something to do with it.</p><br><p>This had always been an interest and even a mystery to the Phantom. All Phantoms were humans, and like ordinary people, they wanted their achievements to mean something.</p><br><p>Defeating a monster with an impressive title could raise the Phantom’s status and ego, and it also promised a battle against a dangerous monster from which something could be learned.</p><br><p>Unfortunately for Bathild, her answer to Adam’s question was the worst possible in this situation.</p><br><p>“I don’t have a title!”</p><br><p>Bathild’s voice echoed through the caves of the colony.</p><br><p>Even Fromund, who had managed to crawl out from under the rubble, was puzzled. He couldn’t understand how such a powerful monster that had wounded him could not have a title.</p><br><p>“Hey!” Fromund exclaimed, staring intently at Bathild.</p><br><p>Perhaps he wanted to take revenge on her for attacking and wounding him, but in fact, there was another reason for his indignation.</p><br><p>“You, Bathild, right? How do you know our names?!”</p><br><p>In response, Bathild raised an eyebrow, looking at him in confusion.</p><br><p>“Hmm? What are you talking about? I only know about him.” She pointed at Adam. “As for you… This is the first time I’ve seen or heard of you.”</p><br><br><p>Fromund blinked several times as his gaze went blank.</p><br><p>‘What? Is she serious? She doesn’t know about me, but… she’s looking at Adam as if she wanted to bump into him a long time ago…’</p><br><p>‘Ahem.’ Arayna coughed, trying to raise Fromund’s fighting spirit. ‘The fact that she doesn’t know your name doesn’t mean anything. Don’t pay any attention to it.’</p><br><p>It didn’t help much. Fromund still wanted to understand why Adam’s name was already known among the monsters, but his wasn’t!</p><br><p>“Wait, how is that possible?!” Fromund clenched his fists in frustration.</p><br><br><p>“Kid, stop wasting my time. If the monsters don’t know you exist, then you’re not worthy, it’s that simple. What’s more, I’m not going to fight you.”</p><br><p>In response, Fromund wanted to say something, but Adam’s voice cut him off.</p><br><p>“You.” Adam stared at Bathild. “You came here at the Queen’s request, right?”</p><br><p>Bathild waved her hand dismissively. “Yeah, the Kirani Queen was afraid that two Phantoms would take all her Twilight Crystals, and as I can see, she was right.”</p><br><p>She looked around. Bathild immediately spotted two places where the Twilight Crystals had been, but now they were gone, and this was a big blow to the Kirani Colony.</p><br><p>“However, she still has two crystals left, and I won’t let you get them. One will be mine, and one will be for that cowardly queen!”</p><br><p>Fromund’s aura grew stronger. He was ready for battle.</p><br><p>Sure, Bathild had wounded him earlier, but he wasn’t too worried about that. He hadn’t expected her to attack, but now everything was different. If Bathild tried the same move against him, he would easily block or dodge it.</p><br><p>Bathild’s eyes darted from Adam to Fromund.</p><br><p>If they attacked at the same time, she was ready for it. It wouldn’t be the first time she had to fight several powerful Phantoms.</p><br><p>However, Adam’s eyes didn’t show the same desire.</p><br><p>“In that case, you can take your reward. We have no reason to stay here.”</p>
