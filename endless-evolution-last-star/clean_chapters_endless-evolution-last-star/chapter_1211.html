            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1211: Blaze Ring (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Fromund had always been physically stronger than most Phantoms. There had been no exceptions to this rule so far, unless his opponent was a Phantom of the same level as him. Even Adam had to admit this.</p><br><p>If their energy levels and mastery were the same, and they fought using only the strength of their bodies and fists, Adam would not stand a chance against Fromund. Some Phantoms, like Katrin, were not even worth comparing to Fromund in this regard; the difference was enormous.</p><br><p>There were many reasons for this, from Fromund’s strong body to his abilities, the battles he had fought, and the decisions he had made on his path. But, as with any other Phantom, his Initial Gene had a strong influence on this, and his Initial Order only amplified this trait to the extreme.</p><br><p>For a K4 Phantom, destroying a Black Threat monster with a single punch was practically impossible.</p><br><p>Sure, a Phantom could kill a monster with one strike if it was a blow to the head, neck, or directly to the heart, but Fromund’s fist simply blew the second monster apart, as if it were caught between a hammer and an anvil.</p><br><p>This made a strong impression on the monsters watching from the sidelines, and even Marhen was no exception.</p><br><p>However, his gaze was not on Fromund, but on the blaze ring hovering behind his back.</p><br><p>“That hammer… it can’t be that it means nothing. However, I don’t understand what exactly he did. I must watch further.”</p><br><br><p>Acting on instinct, the first monster jumped sharply to the side to save his life. It took him only a split second to realize that they had underestimated Fromund and that being too close to him was dangerous.</p><br><p>‘Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! What was that?!’ The first monster exclaimed internally as his eyes darted to the left, looking at the pieces of flesh lying on the ground.</p><br><p>The flesh was not charred, the flames had played almost no part in Fromund’s attack — just pure brute force.</p><br><br><p>Before Fromund took his next step, his Frame shook.</p><br><p>At that moment, the outline of the spear appeared in the blaze ring.</p><br><p>Marhen’s eyes widened as he gradually began to understand how Fromund’s ability worked, but he needed confirmation, or even experiments.</p><br><p>Unfortunately for the first monster, he was about to become one of those experiments.</p><br><br><p>Incredibly fast compared to his previous movements, Fromund rushed forward, ending up right in front of the first monster, who was pinned against the wall with nowhere to retreat.</p><br><p>The only thing the first monster could do was block Fromund’s next hit; it was his only chance to survive.</p><br><p>‘Shit! I have to redirect his fist! I can’t let him touch me!’ The first monster thought as a gust of wind appeared in front of him.</p><br><p>However, even though Fromund was right in front of the monster, his hands remained motionless.</p><br><p>Fromund’s lips curved as he raised his right leg.</p><br><br><p>Before the first monster could react, Fromund’s knee slammed into his head, too fast for him to react.</p><br><p>Then, a fiery stream, like a laser, pierced the first monster’s skull, reaching the wall behind him and leaving a dark stain.</p><br><br><p>With a dull sound, the first monster collapsed to the ground as a smoldering hole gaped in its head.</p><br><p>This caused the monsters to look at each other again. They didn’t understand what Fromund had done or why his two attacks were so different.</p><br><p>However, for one of them, everything became clear.</p><br><p>Marhen narrowed his eyes, staring intently at the smirking Fromund, who was only gathering momentum from that moment on.</p><br><p>‘I see… So the hammer is for slow but tremendous physical strength, and the spear is for quick, piercing attacks. A normal weapon works exactly like that, but all he uses is his body, his fists, and his legs.’</p><br><p>Still, that wasn’t enough for Marhen. He wanted to know everything before he could make a decision.</p><br><p>But… he couldn’t let his subordinates attack Fromund. They would just die one after another, Marhen knew that well.</p><br><p>‘Well, then I just need to buy some time. I can do that. After all, besides me and Bathild, there is one more player here…’</p><br><br><p>Fromund stepped forward, looking at the thunder monsters who were retreating with each step he took. They avoided him like the plague, like a group of hunters who had attacked a beast that was too dangerous.</p><br><p>“Oh, you wanted to fight me so badly. Where did all your fighting spirit and optimism go?”</p><br><p>Then, Fromund tilted his head, and his eyes grew colder.</p><br><p>“If you won’t fight me, that doesn’t mean I’ll do the same. I’ll make you attack me!”</p><br><p>With these words, Fromund spread his arms wide as the blaze ring spun, sending cascades of sparks flying in all directions.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the ground shook, and cracks ran across the surface, forcing the monsters to look down at their feet.</p><br><p>The fastest ones managed to jump aside, but others were not so lucky.</p><br><p>Tremble! Tremble! Tremble!</p><br><p>One after another, pillars of flame burst out of the ground, spreading from Fromund to the monsters like an expanding ring.</p><br><p>If they had been on the surface or in an open field, they could have run away, but not here. The cave walls became a cage from which they could not escape.</p><br><p>The monsters had only two options: either burn when the flame pillars reached them, or rush forward to cross the danger zone, but both options were too dangerous.</p><br><p>“NO! Someone, stop it!”</p><br><p>One of the monsters cried out as the pillar of flame in front of it burned one of them to death. Nothing remained of the monster, only its dark frame disappeared into the fire, piece by piece.</p><br><p>The remaining nine monsters pressed themselves against the wall, another charge, and the flame pillars would reach them.</p><br><p>As a last hope, a blue light fell on them when the turquoise stream of flame collided with Fromund’s fire.</p><br><p>Marhen stood in front of his subordinates, not allowing the flames to reach them.</p><br><p>“Oh, he’s not so simple. I knew it.” Fromund nodded weakly to himself.</p><br><p>From Marhen’s back, from two slits, two fiery wings appeared, wide and majestic with electric discharges running along their edges.</p>
