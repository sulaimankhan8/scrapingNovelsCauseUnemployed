            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1509: Frost Ridge (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>The only significant drawback of the Detached Mountains was that teleportation was instantaneous.</p><br><p>Sure, it sounded strange, but ten seconds ago, Adam and Alexia were at the foot of the mountain, at the Detached Mountains, and next to them was Damien, a Phantom powerful enough to strike fear into every monster in the world.</p><br><p>Now, they were high in the sky in unfamiliar territory. The frosty winds were strong enough to cover their cheeks with a thin layer of ice, threats were everywhere, and one of them was heading straight for them right now.</p><br><br><p>The ice wyvern spread its wings as the monster accelerated, appearing in front of Adam and Alexia just a few moments later.</p><br><p>It seemed as if they were suspended in the air and the whole world had stopped, but in reality, it was all due to the ice wyvern’s intense gaze. It looked at Adam and Alexia, studying them, wanting to understand if they were a threat.</p><br><p>Still, even though Adam and Alexia didn’t expect events to unfold so rapidly, they had found themselves in similar situations before.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Their auras trembled as they prepared for battle.</p><br><p>They didn’t know how strong the ice wyvern before them was. They had no idea, but they couldn’t afford to lose in the first minute.</p><br><p>Well… The law of the jungle that governed the Primal Lands had one peculiarity.</p><br><p>The strong ruled, but they didn’t waste their time on the weak. It wasn’t worth it.</p><br><p>The ice wyvern’s wings spread wide as its gaze lost all interest in the two humans before it.</p><br><p>It wasn’t about the power level or their auras, but the fact that Adam and Alexia didn’t look like hunters ready to fight, but rather like lost rabbits who didn’t know where they were.</p><br><br><p>With another flap of its wings, the ice wyvern sent a swift gust of wind at Adam and Alexia, knocking them aside. The ice wyvern soared high into the sky, returning to its rightful place above the clouds before continuing on its way, without a second glance at the two Phantoms.</p><br><p>In the Dead Lands, such a situation would be very rare. Usually, if a monster could and it was to its advantage, it was ready to attack anyone, be it a monster or a Phantom.</p><br><p>The Tarnished Lands and Dark Shore were different, as most of the powerful monsters there were constantly in human form and acted accordingly.</p><br><p>But here, if a monster did not consider another creature a worthy opponent, that was the end of it.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>Heavy branches smashed into Adam and Alexia’s backs as the wind gust threw them right into the center of the forest.</p><br><p>Every tree here was large enough to cast a shadow over a small village on a sunny day, but these were frozen lands, the trees were bare, and their bark was thick and hard, partially covered with snow and ice.</p><br><br><p>Two figures crashed straight into a snowdrift as silence finally fell.</p><br><p>Adam brushed the snow from his face only to see the bright sunlight shining through the clouds and the countless branches of hundreds of trees above them.</p><br><p>“FUCKKK!” Alexia exclaimed furiously as she jumped to her feet.</p><br><p>She stared at the sky, trying to find the ice wyvern, but by that point, the monster had already disappeared from view.</p><br><p>“Did you see that?” Alexia turned to Adam, who was in no hurry to get up. “Why did it run away? I was ready to fight!”</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Adam got up, brushing the snow off his shoulders and legs.</p><br><p>“That wyvern… Well, it decided we weren’t worthy opponents. That’s it.”</p><br><p>For Alexia, it was a humiliation worse than death. She had never run away from a fight, but the ice wyvern hadn’t run away, it had simply ignored them.</p><br><p>“Shit!” Alexia kicked the snow in anger.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, her eyes widened and her face flushed with pain.</p><br><br><p>She grabbed her leg, hopping in place.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, looking at the rock hidden under the snow. That was where Alexia had kicked.</p><br><p>If it had been a normal rock, Alexia’s kick would have turned it to dust, but here…</p><br><p>“Huh, I see. There’s a lot more energy here than even in the middle of the Tarnished Lands, right? If one of those heavy branches falls on us, we won’t just feel it…” Adam glanced up. “Damn, we’ll get a few broken bones, that’s for sure.”</p><br><p>Adam preferred it when things were this way.</p><br><p>He felt more alive, and everything around him seemed real. He knew that if he threw a rock at a monster, it would have some effect.</p><br><p>In other words, in places where even a simple rock was saturated with dense energy, he could use his surroundings to his advantage.</p><br><p>“Speaking of which.” Adam looked around, noticing several eyes on the branches.</p><br><p>The raven-like monsters were watching them from above. With each passing moment, there were more and more of them, and their long wings ending in blue, icy feathers resembled deadly blades.</p><br><p>Several beasts were on the ground, watching them from behind trees and bushes, but no one was rushing to attack Adam and Alexia.</p><br><p>Like the ice wyvern, they had come here to look at them, to satisfy their curiosity.</p><br><p>But, unlike the ice wyvern, they had no intention of fighting Adam and Alexia from the beginning. That job belonged to someone else.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>A tremor ran through the ground from heavy hooves striking the frozen soil as a shadow fell across the bright passage ahead.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes as he watched the two beasts moving toward them. They resembled bulls in body shape, but thick white fur completely covered their frames. Their eyes were calm and deep, and their tusks grew high and long, menacing and formidable.</p><br><p>However, their proportions were the biggest problem.</p><br><p>Each beast was the size of a large container, not counting their powerful body hidden beneath the thick layer of fur.</p><br><p>Adam and Alexia exchanged glances. They realized that this time they would not be able to avoid battle. They had to show what they were worth if they wanted to reach the Frost Ridge.</p><br><p>Well, they weren’t against it.</p><br><p>“Hah,” Alexia smirked as she stepped forward. “This is just what I need!”</p><br><p>Adam nodded as his blue eyes grew deeper, reflecting the snow and the two monsters ahead.</p><br>
