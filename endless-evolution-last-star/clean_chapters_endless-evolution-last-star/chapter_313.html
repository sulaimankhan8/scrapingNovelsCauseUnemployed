            <br><br><p>Gray Stalkers growled irritably, like resentful dogs that couldn't get their prey. With a glance, they pounced on Scarlet Pyromancer again, leaving claw marks on the cold gray ground.</p><br><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer raised his wings, raising waves of flames as the Gray Stalkers stopped and bounced back. Even if their claws were sharp enough to tear Scarlet Pyromancer's flesh apart, the massive beetle's fire was far more dangerous than a pair of sharp blades.</p><br><br><p>Katrin approached Adam with a serious look. Thanks to her long rest and the effects of the pollen, she was full of energy, just like the rest of their squad.</p><br><p>Thus, if necessary, they were ready to fight at full strength. Right now, except for the slight fatigue, because it was already night, they were ready to show their peak.</p><br><p>"Hey, you're not going to run away even if that dumbass decides so, right?" Katrin arrogantly said pointing a thumb over her shoulder at Oskar who was standing a few meters behind.</p><br><p>Adam smirked as he glanced at Scarlet Pyromancer fending off the Gray Stalkers with his flames.</p><br><p>"Well, well, we've entered Light Yellow Threat territory, but all you're thinking about is the emerging chance to replace your Initial Gene, aren't you?"</p><br><p>Katrin looked away putting her hand to her side.</p><br><p>"Yeah, don't tell me you're scared of two Gray Stalkers. They may be Light Yellow Threat Level, but they're not capable of handling a Scarlet Pyromancer. Your strength is clearly superior."</p><br><br><p>"Hey!" Oskar exclaimed, looking like he had finally made up his mind, "Let's take advantage of the distracted monsters and head to a safe zone. If we move together, we can avoid fighting the monsters and reach the rescue point."</p><br><p>It was worth recognizing that Oskar had made the most pragmatic, safe, and correct decision in terms of preserving the lives of every squad member.</p><br><p>There were no other monsters here yet, which meant they had a chance to get out of the fighter's restricted area. This was probably the best time for them to do so.</p><br><p>But... not everyone thought safety was the most important thing.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, many people were willing to risk jeopardizing their safety if it opened up the possibility of getting something of equal value.</p><br><p>"No. We'll kill the Gray Stalkers and I'll get my Initial Gene, then we'll head to the safe zone." Katrin said confidently, not even bothering to consider Oskar's offer. Your journey continues at mvl</p><br><p>She had already accepted defeat and agreed to return to the Citadel, but now that Scarlet Pyromancer was right in front of her, she wasn't about to back down.</p><br><p>Oskar frowned heavily pointing his sword at Katrin.</p><br><p>"Fuck you! We're only in this situation because of you! If you would have made a decision even a minute earlier, we wouldn't be here! You've already put everyone else in danger once and I won't let you do it again." Oskar said menacingly burning Katrin with his gaze.</p><br><p>"You will do as I say because I am your leader now, I am the leader of the Golden Light Squad. You can replace your Initial Gene another time, right now our lives are the priority!"</p><br><p>Oskar stepped forward, and a menacing gleam ran down the broad blade of his sword.</p><br><p>"If you do not obey, I will make you by force. Maybe after you change your Initial Gene you'll be able to fight me back, but right now you're just the support. You'll lose to me in the blink of an eye." Oskar said threateningly, tightening his grip on the hilt of his massive sword.</p><br><p>It was quite possible that he wasn't lying. If there was a deadly fight between them and Oskar could make a successful attack, he would split Katrin in two like a simple tree trunk.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Before Katrin could respond, Oskar was under intense pressure, so much so that it was a real threat that could seriously harm him.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, coming between Katrin and the sharp tip of the sword. There was no threat in his gaze, unlike Oskar's, just a smug smirk on his face and a look of confidence.</p><br><p>His aura like a white flame spread around, putting some pressure on everyone except Katrin.</p><br><p>"Well, well, so that's how you talk now. I thought squad members were supposed to help each other, not make threatening ultimatums."</p><br><p>Then, Adam stepped forward, Oskar's sword practically touching his chest.</p><br><p>"This is a game you can play together. Don't forget that it was you who invited us to join, not that we asked to join you. Besides, without our help, the Prime Thunder Demon would likely have torn you to pieces, or at best, seriously injured you." Adam lifted his chin staring at Oskar from top to bottom even though Oskar was considerably taller.</p><br><p>It wasn't about actual height it was about demonstrating his status and superiority.</p><br><p>Adam was not going to let Oskar bully Katrin, it was unacceptable.</p><br><p>"I'm offering you two options. First, you leave without us, we can manage on our own, especially if you intend to threaten us instead of assisting us. Second, you help us kill two Gray Stalkers, then watch me and Katrin kill a Scarlet Pyromancer. Katrin gets her Initial Gene and we head to the safe zone."</p><br><p>A gleam passed through Adam's eyes as he looked forward, beyond Oskar's broad shoulders.</p><br><p>"My offers apply not only to Oskar but to everyone else as well. The leader of my squad is Katrin, but that doesn't stop me from acting on my own free will, just like you."</p><br><p>Oskar frowned heavily, gritting his teeth.</p><br><p>He didn't want to admit it, but he couldn't afford to fight Adam. This was an opponent above his league, moreover, even if they were roughly equal in strength, Adam would still win.</p><br><p>Oskar had powerful attacks and abilities, but this meant that he was unable to keep up with fast enemies.</p><br><p>Also, given the nature of Adam's abilities, Oskar would not be able to defend himself against Adam's attacks.</p><br><p>As soon as Oskar thought of their possible battle, a scene of Adam's needle easily piercing his heart appeared in his mind.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Osana stepped forward.</p><br><p>The situation was tense, almost critical, but despite that, she walked with a slight smile on her face and heavily narrowed eyes.</p><br><p>"Agh...? Osana?" Oskar's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>Osana took a few more steps forward holding her long staff in front of her and stopped next to Adam.</p><br><p>"I think that instead of arguing we should get on with our direct duty of killing monsters. I myself am incapable of killing Gray Stalkers and Scarlet Pyromancer, but you or Adam can." Osana said calmly, but her words carried a threat mixed with dangerous cunning, like an invisible snake that coiled around Oskar's neck, whispering in his ear.</p><br><p>"Oskar, if you don't want to kill monsters, then I'll help someone willing to do it." Osana said confidently.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Scarlet Pyromancer's body trembled as he turned into a fiery flash. In a heartbeat, he appeared in front of Gray Stalker piercing the monster's body with his long flaming horn like a spear.</p><br><p>In a few seconds, Gray Stalker was reduced to a pile of ash with a burnt-to-black skeleton impaled on the long horn.</p><br><p>"Oh, now there are only two opponents." Osaka smiled slyly with a tilt of her head.</p><br><p>She directed her gaze to Oskar.</p><br><p>"Come on. You don't mean to say you're scared of two monsters when there are six Phantoms here, do you?"</p><br><p>Katrin watching this scene could only giggle satisfiedly, enjoying the development of the situation.</p>
