            <br><p>"Yes! It's his fault!"</p><br><p>"The Phantoms are getting more brazen every day!"</p><br><p>"We have to do something about it!"</p><br><p>There were some people in the crowd who tried to tell others that Adam was innocent and that Baldhead and the other members of the Proud Wing had set the whole thing up.</p><br><p>However, there were fewer of them than the fake persons, and their voices were simply lost among the shouts of the claimed witnesses to the incident.</p><br><p>Adam didn't understand anything. He didn't even realize that such a thing could happen. So, for the first few seconds, he just stood still, but he quickly came to his senses and ran up to Trici.</p><br><p>"I didn't do it! He's lying! It's my sister and the Operator!" Adam exclaimed, gritting his teeth and clenching his fists tightly. The ice cream had long since fallen from his hands from shock when he saw what had happened.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, yeah it's true!" Baldhead waved his hand with an evil smirk, "However, that doesn't mean you didn't do it. We Proud Wing has seen dozens of cases of Phantoms beating up family members, especially Operators! There's nothing they can do to you, and someone has to deal with it!"</p><br><p>Someone standing behind their group raised their camera high, a glint of light streaming across the lens.</p><br><p>"We've got it all filmed. Later, I can show the video to anyone who wants it!"</p><br><p>Baldhead pointed at the young man.</p><br><p>"See? You can't get away with this. You did it. There are enough witnesses here. However, I'm no villain, and it'll be enough for me if you apologize to them, to me, and pay a large fine!" Baldhead smirked.</p><br><p>In fact, Adam and Silvana knew perfectly well that they hadn't recorded anything, because Adam hadn't done it.</p><br><p>However, there was no way to prove it, not now. Fake persons would just run out of the crowd, supposedly to watch the video, and one of them would accidentally break the camera.</p><br><p>It was their way of not having to justify false accusations, because they didn't need the video to get Adam in trouble - public judgment from dozens of people was enough.</p><br><p>"Apologize to you...?" Adam frowned heavily, gradually his rage growing.</p><br><p>"Adam! They're provoking you! Don't give in to that!" Silvana exclaimed, trying to do something in this situation.</p><br><p>Baldhead sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"Come on. You just injured three people! However, can't you even apologize? Is your arrogance as a Phantom really that great?"</p><br><p>Then, the man turned to the crowd and exclaimed:</p><br><p>"This is exactly why we need Proud Wing and Azure Lotus! Phantoms are our heroes, but not all of them! Many we must control and restrict, or disaster might strike!"</p><br><br><p>Adam approached the baldhead, burning him with his gaze. His veins bulged, and his eyes were bloodshot. He seemed ready to explode with fury at any moment - that's how angry he was.</p><br><p>"Damn, do you really want to continue this? Maybe you'll hit me? Tsk. As usual, Phantoms can only solve their problems with force!" Baldhead smirked.</p><br><p>He was going to provoke Adam further, even if Adam attacked him. It was necessary to accomplish his mission.</p><br><p>However, Adam held back. He knew that if he did so under dozens of stares, he and his family could be in trouble.</p><br><p>Baldhead realized this, so he decided to fix the situation, leaving Adam no chance.</p><br><p>He leaned over to Adam and whispered:</p><br><p>'Come on, do it, or else... I'll get your sister in trouble more than once...'</p><br><br><p>Adam's body immediately came into motion as his fist headed towards the man.</p><br><p>Baldhead's pupils narrowed. He could hardly see anything because Adam was moving too fast. He hadn't been prepared for this! No one warned him that the Phantoms were so strong!</p><br><p>However... he didn't even know that getting hit by a Phantom was the most harmless thing that could happen to him.</p><br><br><p>Adam's fist went through the man's head, blasting it like a meatball due to the immense force.</p><br><p>Pieces of flesh, blood clots, and parts of the brain, along with eyes and teeth, flew apart, covering the ground around him.</p><br><p>The man's already decapitated corpse fell down, raising a cloud of dust.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..." Adam breathed heavily, exhaling hot steam, slowly coming to his senses.</p><br><p>For the first few seconds, he didn't even realize what had happened, and neither did the crowd, but... soon everyone figured out that it was real.</p><br><br><p>People screamed in fear, running away in panic. Some stayed behind, staring intently at Adam, but soon, they too, were gone, not wanting to stay here a second longer.</p><br><p>Surely, in such a large crowd, there were some people who had filmed the whole thing, and now Adam would certainly be in trouble.</p><br><p>It didn't matter who he was, businessman, politician, military, or Phantom, he had killed a man in front of dozens. Moreover, this happened when he was accused of assaulting three other people!</p><br><p>The situation was worse than anything!</p><br><p>"Adam!" Silvana exclaimed anxiously, running up to him. The members of the Proud Wing were the first to run away, their hearts nearly stopping with fear when Adam killed the baldhead.</p><br><p>Adam said nothing, he just looked at his bloody fist, then glanced at the baldhead.</p><br><p>Slowly, he realized that he had just killed a civilian, but... He didn't feel any regret about it. Moreover, he felt nothing. It hadn't happened even when he had killed Mirna and the other dark Phantoms from Lower Ring.</p><br><p>He sighed heavily, falling to one knee.</p><br><p>"Brother!" Trici, with her face covered in tears, ran to him and hugged him.</p><br><p>Adam just slowly stroked her head, thinking about what would happen to him next. Somehow, the law worked not only for the ordinary people but for the Phantoms as well.</p><br><p>Murder was one of the worst sins a person in the Citadel could do.</p><br><br><p>Thirty minutes later, when the fair was already closed, several police cars pulled up to the entrance. Among them were several Phantoms, for they knew that the outlaw was a Phantom.</p><br><p>However, they did not have to fight, for Adam did not resist. He realized he could do nothing now, and he didn't want to. He had to wait until tomorrow to try to change the situation.</p><br><p>"Brother, don't go! I'm coming with you!" Trici shouted, grabbing his leg and not wanting to leave.</p><br><p>The two police officers were about to pull her away, but as soon as they walked up to Trici, a chill ran down their backs from Adam's stare. It was piercing and overpowering, instilling terror in them.</p><br><p>It seemed that if they took another step, Adam, in his current state, would attack them, and no one could help them.</p><br><p>He was a Phantom, so there was no point in handcuffing him, only hoping he wouldn't fight back.</p><br><p>"Don't worry. I'll be back soon." Adam, with a slight smile, said, patting Trici on the head, "For now, stay with Silvana, and don't let mom and dad worry too much, okay?"</p><br><p>"Ughum!" Trici nodded, biting her lip - trying to hold back her tears, but she failed miserably. Salty drops fell quickly to the ground, dripping off her cheeks.</p>
