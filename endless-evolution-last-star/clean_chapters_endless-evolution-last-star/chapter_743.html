            <br><br><p>Adam jumped down the slope, rapidly approaching the bottom. The red stone cave walls and the massive bloody river surrounded him, except for the many monsters not paying much attention to him.</p><br><p>They had a lot of work to do, especially on this momentous night, which allowed them to draw so much blood from the top.</p><br><p>The Carnage Jaws, fed up from eating the corpse of one of the temple's followers, turned their gazes in Adam's direction. Their jaws blurred into a satisfied grin as they simultaneously pounced on Adam.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes slowly turned to the side. He was ready to fight, he had come here for this, so he took a fighting stance, red flames slowly streaked before his eyes came out from the needle.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A slight shiver went through the ground from Carnage Jaws' powerful legs, but it didn't scare Adam. In his opinion, they were the weakest opponents here; even the Shadow Walkers posed a greater threat.</p><br><p>'Hmm... There are quite a few of them, but even if they bite me it won't be a big deal. As soon as I reached the bottom, I could immediately feel how dense the energy here was, and the smell of blood filled the air. It's probably all about the river...'</p><br><p>Adam's eyes reflected the first three meat balls jumping at him with jaws wide open.</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could do anything, a multitude of thin, taut strings appeared from the side, piercing Carnage Jaws.</p><br><p>Several Carnage Jaws appeared to be strung on each string, their large eyes darting in an attempt to free themselves from the sudden attack, but without hands or unique abilities, it was impossible.</p><br><p>Then, the strings, long as ropes, swept to the side, throwing all the Carnage Jaws straight into the bloody river. Explore stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Adam blinked a few times trying to figure out what had happened and most importantly who did it.</p><br><br><p>Splashes of the crimson liquid rose from the river, engulfing the Carnage Jaws. They absorbed the Thirst Redeemer's body and thus became a valuable source of energy themselves, but utterly useless as warriors.</p><br><p>At least that was how their murderer pondered.</p><br><p>"I can't say humans never do that... But aren't you being a little harsh?" Adam raised an eyebrow watching a silent silhouette standing not far from the riverbank.</p><br><p>The monster had a long body like a centipede, thin, divided into many parts, protected by strong armor, with two thin legs growing out of each part, slightly touching the ground.</p><br><p>Yet, unlike the Thirst Redeemer, that one had little in common with insects except for its terrifying appearance. Its upper body was humanoid, the two arms held a single spear and the long jaw was slightly open revealing many rows of teeth and a purple throat.</p><br><p>The monster's face was covered by a triangular narrow plate, allowing it to breathe but not to see, though... it was unlikely that the Vile Believer relied on its sight.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes caught the last of the strings disappearing into the Vile Believer's jaw.</p><br><p>"Well, well... Another freak. Well, you may be ruthless to your fellows, but you don't look strong."</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam lunged forward turning into a deadly shadow. A few seconds were enough time for Silvana to give him all the information he needed, as well as what the Vile Believers' weaknesses were.</p><br><p>'So there are weak defenses at the junctions of parts of its long body... It's logical and effective.'</p><br><p>His eyes twitched to the side, looking at the short layer of dark flesh between the two protective plates, if Adam's needle ended up at that point, it would be all but over for the Vile Believer.</p><br><p>However, the monster was not about to give up. It sacrificed the Carnage Jaws to speed up the preparations for the ritual, as the monster was confident in its abilities.</p><br><br><p>The Vile Believer swung its spear, its long body moving in sync, preparing to block Adam's attack.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam appeared right in front of the Vile Believer, for some reason he decided to change his plan and attack the monster directly.</p><br><p>"I don't need to take advantage of your weaknesses, I can just kill you since I'm much stronger."</p><br><br><p>With a trail of flames, the needle came down on the Vile Believer. At the last moment, the monster managed to put its spear in front of it.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the old and weak-looking spear was able to withstand a direct hit from the flaming needle, the sharp blade failing to slice through the hilt, leaving only a deep cut.</p><br><p>Realizing that Adam could do nothing, the Vile Believer decided to take advantage of this brief period by opening its jaw. A multitude of strings fluttering like tentacles at Thirst Redeemer's mouth revealed themselves.</p><br><p>Silvana quickly realized what was happening through shared sight as she exclaimed:</p><br><br><p>There was no panic in her voice as had often happened before, just a natural reaction to a dangerous situation.</p><br><p>But, Adam was well aware that the Vile Believer could do no differently in the outcome of their clash.</p><br><br><p>Adam jumped, letting go of his needle and instead grasping the handle of the spear with both hands, using it for support like an athlete preparing to perform a move.</p><br><p>His foot darted high up, whizzing in front of the Vile Believer's face. Then, before the strings could turn into deadly weapons, Adam's foot came down on the Vile Believer's head with the force of a steel hammer.</p><br><br><p>The protective plate shattered, bursting into sharp shards, chunks of flesh, and shards of blood. Adam's hit was too strong for the monster's head to withstand.</p><br><p>Many thin legs shuddered before collapsing to the ground simultaneously without strength or control.</p><br><p>Adam leapt back picking up his needle stuck in the ground, then he looked around feeling the intense stares, cruel and bloodthirsty.</p><br><p>"Well, well... Looks like it's time to call it a day with using only one ability, doesn't it?"</p><br><p>Behind Adam, a river of blood raged behind him, that was his defense, but on all other sides he was surrounded by dozens of monsters, the most were the Carnage Jaws and the Sacrificial Holders, but the Vile Believers were slightly less.</p><br><p>Moreover... behind them stood a tall shadow, another Thirst Redeemer, this time they would attack all together as they realized that Adam, his body, and the energy hidden within would help complete the ritual ahead of time.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze's calm voice echoed through Adam's mind.</p><br><p>[Fools... They will burn in our... flames...]</p>
