            <br><p>Adam and Osana's conversation had been a long one, but now everything was falling into place. Adam understood why Osana did what she did and the situation she was in.</p><br><p>In fact, Adam probably would help her anyway since she had saved his life, but Osana showed her best side.</p><br><p>Adam was glad that she knew what she wanted and wasn't a spoiled noblewoman, she was a Phantom who just faced a difficult problem like many of them.</p><br><p>Adam took it rather lightly, Osana assured him that if he performed well in the three months of training he might succeed in The Rule of Power. He had no reason not to believe her.</p><br><p>But... someone was taking this much more closely and was wary because of the whole situation.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, it wasn't Osana or the Rouzet Family, but someone else who was very close to Adam.</p><br><p>Adam wasn't stupid and realized the situation was serious, but he was more focused on his task than on the consequences of offending people.</p><br><br><p>Two cups of bitter coffee were the only ones on the round wooden table in one of the thousands of simple coffee shops where people came every day to wake up before work.</p><br><p>In the corner of the room sat two girls, one was an Operator, the other was a Phantom and although they didn't work with each other, they were indirectly familiar.</p><br><p>This was their second meeting and... the tension was massive, one could feel it building with every passing second.</p><br><p>Silvana stared intently at Osana, her eyes narrowed and her gaze menacing and sharp, filled with irritation.</p><br><p>Osana on the other hand just smiled innocently. She wasn't wearing a disguise here, since this was the Third Ring and the chances of anyone recognizing her were minimal.</p><br><p>"Why? Why did you drag Adam into all this?" Silvana asked calmly but her voice was menacing.</p><br><p>She was willing to accept that Adam was willing to face the challenges and fight in Dead Lands, she didn't worry about it anymore and only supported him even if bloody battles awaited in the future.</p><br><p>But... coming into conflict with two great families could affect his life in the Citadel and his family as well.</p><br><p>"What do you mean? I just asked my battle comrade for help. Is there anything strange about that?" Osana replied ironically, she knew what Silvana was talking about but she wasn't going to give up quickly.</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head, took a deep breath, and leaned back in her chair.</p><br><p>"You can keep playing these games, I'll wait or you can stop wasting my time and yours and tell me why you set Adam up like this. What has he done to you that he is now under the threat of two great families?"</p><br><p>Osana narrowed her eyes, then she slowly nodded.</p><br><p>"Fine, you win. Silvana, I simply have no other choice. Adam is the strongest and most talented of the Naturalborn Phantom who is not a nobleman and is not under anyone's command. He is a free bird who only cares about fighting worthy opponents."</p><br><br><p>"Perhaps that's why no one has recruited him yet. He goes to the Dead Lands, then he heals for weeks only to come back and repeat the cycle. You took part in that too, didn't you?"</p><br><p>Silvana cast a sidelong glance. Osana was talking about Silvana ignoring the suggestions of the great families about recruiting Adam when they wrote to her.</p><br><p>"Silvana, you're Adam's Operator, so I don't want there to be animosity or tension between us. I've already told you everything. Yeah, I got a little tricky with the three wishes, but everything I told Adam is the truth."</p><br><p>The situation was dangerous for Osana as she realized that if anyone in this world had the power to influence Adam, it was Silvana.</p><br><p>Perhaps Osana's fate was now in Silvana's hands.</p><br><p>"I know, but it's still a complicated situation. Adam is not a nobleman, he is talented and strong, yes, but he is still just a K2-Phantom who only recently moved to this level. Compared to the two great families, he's just a nobody."</p><br><p>Silvana's words might sound harsh, but it was reality. If Adam was a nobleman of the Twelve Branches, though standing up for Osana would have its risks, but his family would protect him.</p><br><p>But... who would protect Adam if the Marzo or the Rouzet Family were furious about the disrupted wedding?</p><br><p>"Agh... How much trouble you've caused us. I understand your situation and that you had no choice, but it doesn't change the fact that it's all very dangerous.</p><br><p>Silvana glanced at Osana.</p><br><p>"Who's going to help Adam if the great families want revenge? Ruining the wedding of two Light Nobles when one of them is a Natural Phantom is like committing a deadly sin."</p><br><p>Silvana continued with a wave of her hand:</p><br><p>"Yeah, they'll accept the outcome of The Rule of Power, but who knows what they'll do after that."</p><br><p>Osana smirked as she folded her hands together.</p><br><p>"Well, I've been thinking about that too. Sorry, but I did a little research using my connections. I know that Damien himself has an interest in Adam."</p><br><br><br><p>"You know, not every Phantom, even the Naturalborn One, is helped by Damien himself, like getting a Golden Mission to quickly collect genes, being hosted at his home and giving a few tips, being rescued from a distant area after a spatial anomaly, or having a training battle right in the Fort Norton."</p><br><br><p>"Damien is strong, so he just sees potential and talent in Adam. What's more, Adam the Naturalborn Phantom, that's important!"</p><br><br><p>"Sure, also I'm confident that besides Damien there are other people whose eyes are caught on Adam, especially after he defeated the Plague Reaper."</p><br><p>Silvana looked at Osana, she spoke as if she knew something that was a mystery to both Silvana and Adam.</p><br><br><p>Neither of them said anything for a while. They realized the situation they were in and now all they had to do was work together on the problem.</p><br><p>But... Silvana still had one question she wanted to hear the answer to.</p><br><p>"That ring you gave him... Is it all a game or are your intentions really serious?"</p><br><p>Osana tilted her head with a devious smile.</p><br><p>"Hm? What are you talking about? Explain yourself more precisely so I can understand and answer you."</p><br><p>Silvana looked away as her cheeks flushed slightly.</p><br><p>"In that case, no... when Adam wins in The Rule of Power, what will you do?"</p><br><p>With a slight pause, Silvana slowly looked at Osana.</p><br><p>"Are you actually going to marry him and... take his last name?"</p><br><p>Silvana tried to hide it as much as she could, but it was obvious that her voice was trembling slightly and her heart was beating fast with anxiety.</p><br><p>To someone with a keen eye like Osana, it was as obvious as a bright flame amid darkness.</p><br><p>Osana smiled bitterly, not intending to give Silvana an easy answer.</p><br><p>"It's up to him. If he wants me to be his wife, I will become Osana Vinter. If he wants, he'll become Adam De Rouzet. Or... he'll just leave the battlefield, say his task is done and head for the Dead Lands like he always does."</p>
