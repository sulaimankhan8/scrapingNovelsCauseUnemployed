            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1410: Ancient Voice</strong></p><br><p>When Adam fought against Ureyn, many monsters of the Forgotten Mills watched the battle. Members of all three factions arrived to find out the winner of the String Duel.</p><br><p>The battle against Beatra was not as large-scale and spectacular, but there were just as many spectators, if not more. This was influenced by the fact that they were fighting at the Red Eye Arena and that Adam deliberately revealed his name at the right moment to attract more attention.</p><br><p>Now, it was time for Adam’s next serious battle, and despite how important this fight was for him and Anelez, they did not have a large audience.</p><br><br><p>A cold wind blew across the spacious plain, which was part of the silent expanse. It was a lonely, free territory located west of Izardo. There were practically no monsters here, and there were few valuable resources or points of interest.</p><br><p>The silent expanse was not the only such territory; there were many similar places in the world, but thanks to its location, the silent expanse became an excellent place for battles between monsters that would be too destructive for Izardo and the arenas.</p><br><p>Sure, Helasa, Xander, and many other monsters who knew about this battle couldn’t deny themselves the pleasure of watching them, but they did so from a distance.</p><br><p>It was a kind of unspoken rule that everyone followed. No one was to interfere with the two fighters who had come to the Silent Expanse to resolve their conflict.</p><br><p>They would be able to see what Anelez was capable of at her peak, as well as how Adam Vinter, a Phantom who had gained fame among monsters even at the early K4 level, fought.</p><br><p>But Adam and Anelez would not hear the voices and exclamations of the spectators; no one would interfere with them, and only the white moon would accompany them during their battle.</p><br><p>“Are you ready to begin?” Anelez asked, her face remaining calm.</p><br><p>“Yes. The Rule of Blood, right?” Adam stepped forward. “Xander told me in detail how to do it correctly, but I hope you can help me.”</p><br><p>“Sure.” Anelez nodded respectfully as she took out a bundle—inside were two simple daggers with dark blades. “We will cut our palms at the same time. Through blood and our will, we will attract the attention of the energy. Since I am a Hybrid, we will be able to use the Rule of Blood.”</p><br><p>Adam said nothing as he approached and took the dagger in his hands. They were close enough to attack each other. Perhaps one accurate hit in this situation could lead to victory for one of them.</p><br><p>Obviously, neither of them was going to stoop to such dirty tricks. Not only because it was despicable, but also because such a victory would be meaningless to either of them.</p><br><p>They exchanged glances and nodded.</p><br><br><p>Simultaneously, they left long cuts on their palms. The blood flowing from the wound formed a thin stream that reached the edge of their palms and fell to the ground in dark drops.</p><br><p>Then, they clasped each other’s hands tightly, allowing not only their blood to mix but also their energy.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>As Anelez had said, this inevitably attracted the attention of the world. The energy swirled around them, carrying within it the ancient will of the First Star and Last Star, which distinguished this energy from any other.</p><br><br><p>A strange, mechanical voice sounded in their minds. Anelez did not react, unlike Adam, whose eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br><p>The last time he had heard something like this was when he was talking to the Path Construct, or rather, trying to do so. When he created the First Grand Star, he heard a similar voice, one that was very different from a human voice or even that of the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>[This is one of the ancient traditions… The winner has the right to make one wish of the loser’s.]</p><br><p>Their grip remained firm as blood dripped down onto the cold ground. Adam’s heart beat faster and faster as he was both excited and frightened. No one had warned him about this.</p><br><p>[You have made the right gesture… the right ritual… But… Do you really want to participate in the Rule of Blood? Is this your will?]</p><br><p>After a few moments, the strange voice added:</p><br><p>[Your answer is required to continue…]</p><br><p>Anelez was the first to respond:</p><br><p>“Yes. I want to participate in the Rule of Blood. I want to defeat Adam Vinter and will give it my all. If I lose, I will fulfill his every wish and expect the same from my opponent.”</p><br><p>After a brief pause, Adam nodded.</p><br><p>“I am ready to fight. I accept all the conditions of the Rule of Blood. If it allows me to have a worthy fight, then I am ready to follow this ancient tradition.”</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the voice disappeared as two streams of energy rushed through Adam and Anelez’s bodies. These were waves of energy that washed over them again and again until they diminished in size, becoming two bright dots.</p><br><p>Then, the dots appeared on their hands, forming the drop sign. Once their fight was over and the winner received their reward, the drop sign would disappear. It was only needed as confirmation that the two fighters had participated in the Rule of Blood.</p><br><br><p>Anelez took a step back and covered her palm with her other hand, directing energy to close her wound and speed up the regeneration of the cut.</p><br><p>“I see you’re surprised, right?” She glared at Adam.</p><br><p>“Yeah…” Adam’s voice trembled. “This is not what I expected. What a strange feeling. That voice… It’s so deep.”</p><br><p>“Because it’s ancient,” Anelez replied sharply. “I’m sure you can learn more about it, but right now we both have a more important task ahead of us, don’t we?”</p><br><p>Anelez’s tone was calm, as was her gaze, but Adam could feel her aura growing stronger. All the formalities and preparations were over.</p><br><p>Now, they had to fight to see which of them was the strongest.</p><br><p>Which of them would be able to break through their barrier and make a wish on the defeated one?</p>
