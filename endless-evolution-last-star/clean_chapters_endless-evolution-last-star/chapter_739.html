            <br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>White broken lines covered the Dormant Lord's right arm, dense energy rising from his feet, unleashing a powerful pressure on the area around him.</p><br><p>Tiny grains of sand, millions coating the dark lands around the fortress slightly trembled with every step he took, yet they were not his target.</p><br><p>The One-Eyed Serpent Archers had made a serious mistake of trying to destroy the Dormant Lord after he had handled the Flame Raider.</p><br><p>Sure, given his past attack, it's possible that the Dormant Lord would soon storm the fortress, but he would do so from the side of the bridge where the Phantoms would face him.</p><br><p>However... now the Dormant Lord had a clear objective, to destroy the northern wall and kill the archers who decided to attack him at his moment of weakness.</p><br><p>The Grim Warro watching this scene grinned widely. Resources and energy didn't interest him as much as chaos, and destroying one of the walls was a good place to start.</p><br><p>Ripple. Ripple. Ripple.</p><br><p>The Silent Droao hovering over the hill in the distance let out a strange short pulsation, a shudder ran through its watery sphere, as if the monster was trying to say something or get rid of its emotions.</p><br><p>The Silent Droao had another purpose, it attacked the Grim Warro earlier because of it, but the Dormant Lord's actions didn't interfere with the Silent Droao's plans, the drop-shaped creature was fine with it.</p><br><p>At that moment, while the Dormant Lord was focused on the high wall ahead, the Grim Warro and the Silent Droao exchanged a quick glance.</p><br><p>Although it didn't happen very often among monsters, they, like humans, could rapidly change their positions depending on the current situation.</p><br><p>Those who were mortal enemies a few minutes ago could easily become allies, then... everything could change again.</p><br><p>However, they were not in a hurry to move into action, first, they had to understand what the Dormant Lord would achieve by his measures.</p><br><p>At his will, the energy quickly turned into a plasma spear. He already created several, but it didn't affect his energy supply in any significant way. It was almost impossible to defeat an opponent like the Dormant Lord through attrition.</p><br><p>The archers realized what the Dormant Lord was going to do, so they immediately fired another shot. They acted quickly, making the arrows only half of their power, but they all flew straight at the Dormant Lord.</p><br><p>However, he was in no hurry to dodge, although even the weakest monster was aware that the trajectory of the arrows was excellent, their target was the Dormant Lord's chest.</p><br><p>With full confidence in his abilities, the Dormant Lord stretched his left hand forward, accumulating energy in front of his palm.</p><br><p>The white streams condensed into a quivering white orb, no larger than a seed, but as dense as a true star.</p><br><p>Then, the Dormant Lord's fingers flexed slightly, the orb shrank as the leading edge burst open unable to resist the pressure.</p><br><p>A wide beam rained down on the rushing arrows, covering everything in a blinding light. The purple arrows became erratic shadows, quickly disappearing piece by piece.</p><br><p>Before the archers could realize that the Dormant Lord easily destroyed the shots with just one ability, the Dormant Lord threw his spear forward.</p><br><p>The speed and force were not as intimidating as the first time, but now the distance was much smaller than between Crystal Gorge and the fortress.</p><br><p>The archers hurriedly prepared their next shots, but they didn't have enough time.</p><br><br><p>A black blob emerged in front of the spear, colliding with its trembling tip. The clot of darkness was dense enough not to be destroyed immediately, just enough time for the darkness to damage the structure of the spear, provoking all the energy to come out ahead of time.</p><br><p>Booooooooooooooooom.</p><br><p>A flash of light illuminated the lands in front of the northern wall, the shockwave reached the water ring but failed to damage the solid wall.</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord was baffled as were the four archers. They were ready to fight this too-strong opponent for the fortress, but... they didn't know who intervened.</p><br><br><p>Hiding under the cover of light from the flash, the black broad blade cut the light in two, aiming for the Dormant Lord's neck.</p><br><p>The attack was perfect, the Dormant Lord didn't notice anything, but his instincts were far beyond his control. Without his awareness, his body took a short step back, the sword tip whizzing within a centimeter of his skin.</p><br><p>Realizing his failure, the shadow jumped back to a safe distance.</p><br><p>A second later, the flash of light from the explosion dissipated, revealing Katrin's silhouette.</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord lifted his chin slightly, looking at Katrin's from top to bottom. Curiosity was evident in his gaze, or rather a question - what took so long?</p><br><p>He recognized her, the Dormant Lord had noticed her back when he had fought against the Flame Raider, but they had only now encountered each other.</p><br><p>Before entering the battle, the Dormant Lord pointed at Katrin, then at something behind him, in that direction was the Crystal Gorge.</p><br><p>Your journey continues on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord couldn't speak or make any sounds like the Grim Warro, but that didn't stop him from asking his second question.</p><br><p>Katrin smiled bitterly, realizing what he was interested in.</p><br><p>"Hah, I'm sorry, it was too unprofitable for me to fight against you at that moment. Even if I had won, the monsters from the waves would have just exhausted me and torn me apart, but..."</p><br><p>She glanced around, there was nothing but hundreds of meters of dark sand nearby, the monsters were afraid to approach two such powerful creatures. Behind her was a ring of water, a guard hiding deep below, and a high wall, damaged but still holding a defense.</p><br><p>So although Katrin was not inside the fortress, the terrain was a natural defense for her, providing a 1 on 1 arena against the Dormant Lord with possible archer support.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, the Dormant Lord nodded slightly and released his intimidating aura once more, the nine-pointed star soaring into full power.</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord didn't hope to defeat Katrin with his aura, he wasn't that arrogant.</p><br><p>He accepted Katrin's challenge to duel and using the Spirits was a natural start.</p><br><p>Now, Katrin had no choice but to release her aura to resist the Dormant Lord's pressure.</p>
