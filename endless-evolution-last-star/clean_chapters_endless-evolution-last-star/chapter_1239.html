            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1239: Development of Territories (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Everything in this world has a beginning and an end. Everyone knew this, and this rule applied to both living and non-living things.</p><br><p>However, those who knew much more about the world than ordinary people understood that there was one exception to this rule—the World Wipe.</p><br><p>No one knew when it had begun, and even the most powerful beings in this world, the Second Rank Phantoms and Lords, had been unable to stop it until now.</p><br><p>At the same time, the two K4-Phantoms actually wanted to destroy this rule and prove that even the First and Last Stars were not untouchable.</p><br><p>To do this, they needed a plan of action, but it was too early to think about that yet. First, they had to become strong enough, and every day they took a step forward.</p><br><p>After Adam and Fromund had dinner at their usual cafeteria, they went for a walk at the Bastion Opard.</p><br><p>They had free time for this, because they would have to spend the next few days or a week recovering their strength anyway. Silvana and Arayna simply would not let them go on the next mission if they were not at their peak.</p><br><p>The Bastions were much smaller than the Citadel, so they were arranged a little differently. Instead of the three rings and slums that were essentially a fourth ring, the Bastion Opard had only two rings.</p><br><p>The first ring was significantly smaller than the second one, in which Bastion Opard and the Citadel were similar.</p><br><p>All the most influential and wealthy people, government buildings, valuable resources in underground vaults, and so on were located in the first ring of the territory, while ordinary people lived in the second ring.</p><br><p>In fact, both in the Citadel and in the Bastions, only the first ring mattered, because it was this area that would survive the World Wipe thanks to the Second Rank Phantoms who would create barriers.</p><br><p>“Damn, it’s pretty here, right?!” Fromund exclaimed as the view of the entire Bastion Opard opened up before them.</p><br><p>They were at the First Ring, in the business district next to a large park.</p><br><br><p>Well, they decided to return to the Citadel only after a few days, but they couldn’t stay with the military any longer. Not that anyone forbade them, but it was simply inappropriate.</p><br><p>The logical solution was to book rooms in a hotel, one with lots of restaurants, so they could satisfy their hunger while they took a break from the Dead Lands and their missions.</p><br><p>From the top of the skyscraper, they could see the entire city, as well as what lay beyond the walls, which were not as large or high as those of the Citadel.</p><br><p>“Yeah, I agree, but… Don’t you think things should be a little different?” Adam asked, as a cold wind ruffled the ends of his black hair.</p><br><p>Fromund turned to him, puzzled. “Hmm? What do you mean?”</p><br><p>In response, Adam pointed to the empty land around the Bastion. It was early morning, so black dots were visible near the walls—the K0-Phantoms carrying out missions to clear weak Nests and hunt monsters.</p><br><p>“There’s just nothing here. I mean, it’s not difficult for us to move from one Bastion to another or to the Citadel. We could do it before with the help of fighters, but now we have teleports, which makes everything much easier.</p><br><p>“But… What about ordinary people? If you’re not connected to the Dead Lands, getting to the Citadel from the Bastion is practically impossible. To do that, you need either a good reason or influence with a lot of money.”</p><br><p>Fromund scratched his cheek. He hadn’t expected Adam to steer the conversation in this direction. He thought they would be discussing the view, the food, and the park.</p><br><p>However, he had an opinion on the matter as well.</p><br><p>“Sure, you’re right, but thanks to satellites, everyone, no matter where they are, can see the news, watch shows, and read articles from all over the world.</p><br><p>If you live here, at the Bastion Opard, you have access to everything available to a person in the Citadel, just in a different location.”</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>“Well, that’s not exactly what I meant, but it’s a good point. I wonder, if it weren’t for the World Wipe, what would have changed in the world?”</p><br><p>Before Fromund could say anything, Adam pointed ahead again.</p><br><p>“Instead of bare land, there could be tunnels connecting the Bastions to the Citadel. What’s more, if the Bastions and the Citadel were close to each other, a safe zone could be created between them for many kilometers.”</p><br><p>Fromund was silent for a moment, realizing what Adam was talking about.</p><br><p>“Got it. That would be cool, actually, but you can’t build things like that knowing they’ll disappear soon. Moreover, even without the World Wipe, you’d have to get rid of the monsters first so they wouldn’t destroy the tunnels.”</p><br><br><p>“Yeah, I know that’s impossible in the current situation. I’m just saying that we humans are severely limited by the fact that we have to rebuild everything from scratch over and over again.”</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, he leaned forward. His eyes slowly scanned the land around the Bastion Opard.</p><br><p>“I know that with each World Wipe, the situation gets a little better. Several hundred, let alone thousands of years ago, things were much worse, and humanity was barely surviving. Now, Douglas, Damien, and the others have a plan of action, resources, and storage facilities, but that’s not enough.</p><br><p>“Even if, in a few hundred years, humanity manages to expand its territory or build a new Bastion, for example, it will still be meaningless, because there will be no one to defend it all.”</p><br><p>Fromund’s lips curved upward as fire lit up in his eyes.</p><br><p>“Hah, that’s exactly why you and I must become Second Rank Phantoms. Not only to stop the Last and First Stars, but to protect the people and structures of humanity.”</p><br><p>Then, Fromund raised his fist, looking at the bright sun.</p><br><p>“It’s decided! When I become a Second Rank Phantom, I’ll demand that I get my own Bastion too! I’ll protect it!”</p><br><p>Adam smiled but said nothing, though the thought was pleasing to him as well.</p><br><p>‘My own Bastion…? That wouldn’t be bad, I won’t lie.’</p>
