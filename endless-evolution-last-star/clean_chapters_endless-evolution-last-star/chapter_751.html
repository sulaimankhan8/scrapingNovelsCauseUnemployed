            <br><p>With a distinct creak, the long sword slowly rose from the hallow of the spire. The sturdy chain no longer shook, and all the shards were held tightly together.
</p><br><p>The hilt hadn’t changed a bit, it remained as Adam saw it, but now the hilt looked harmonious and fitting without standing out against the blade.
</p><br><p>The new ice sword was several times larger than the previous one, a true warrior’s weapon, heavy and deadly with a unique essence, not a simple sword that without its frost effect would be no different from a training one.
</p><br><p>After a long time, some of the bandages finally fell from The Blind Sinner’s face, revealing hair, bright blue eyes, and a mouth, yet these were not the only physical changes.
</p><br><p>The Blind Sinner had grown taller, whereas Adam’s height had previously surpassed him by one palm, now the situation was reversed. The transformation didn’t add muscles, on the contrary, the height gain made him look even thinner than he was, yet the Blind Sinner didn’t look weak.
</p><br><p>As before, his whole being showed that brute strength was not his way, he preferred speed and energy filled with piercing frost.
</p><br><p>"Gha..." The Blind Sinner took a deep breath, it finally happened, though he had not sought to obtain this power.
</p><br><p>In fact, the fortress, and thus the External Artifact gave him this opportunity quite some time ago. The blue flame of the spire was burning specifically for him to absorb it and move on to the next stage.
</p><br><p>The Blind Sinner could do this at any time, but... why did he choose to do it only now? Any monster in his place would have rushed over and absorbed the flame as soon as possible.
</p><br><p>Well, a lot depended on the nature of his kind, but the biggest reason was that the Blind Sinner realized that for such a gift, for such an amount of energy, he would have to offer something in return.
</p><br><p>He had the option to ignore the will of the fortress, but he simply could not do so. The Blind Sinner didn’t want to deceive anyone, he was fine with it and so he didn’t absorb the flame stream.
</p><br><p>But the situation forced him to resort to the last resort. It wasn’t even about Adam beating him, nah, defeat and rest suited him perfectly.
</p><br><p>However, the Dormant Lord was a whole other level of threat. The Blind Sinner wasn’t about to lose the fortress, the place that for a long time was his home. Moreover, now he had the opportunity to repay the fortress for the power it gave him.
</p><br><br><p>With long strides, dragging his heavy sword along the ground, the Blind Sinner looked around. He wasn’t interested in the battle between Katrin and the Dormant Lord, he knew the outcome of that confrontation long ago.
</p><br><p>What he was concerned about were the hundreds of shadows near the fortress and thousands more silhouettes near the hilltops. The monsters were growing in number as they waited for the main battle between the strongest monster and the Phantom to end, but their patience was running out.
</p><br><p>The Blind Sinner realized that not even ten minutes later the monsters would descend on the fortress from all sides, they would not be stopped by the archers or the water ring around them.

</p><br><p>They will be climbing on each other like mad, walking on the bodies of the fallen, but gradually they will reach the tops of the walls, even if their ladder will be mountains of monsters like them.
</p><br><p>The same thing would happen to the bridge and the gate, there was no doubt about it. The Dormant Lord’s victory would only accelerate this process and make it irreversible.
</p><br><p>Nodding deeply, the Blind Sinner glanced at the nearest archer. The One-Eyed Serpent Archer sensed the powerful aura of the last commander and answered his call.
</p><br><p>The Blind Sinner pointed far ahead, then he moved his hand to the purple fire, not far from the archer.
</p><br><p>Each tower had a different stream of flame, but not as powerful as the spire, in a way it was a one-time trump card for each archer. Something like this helped the Blinding Sylphyre survive, but they should only use it as a last resort.
</p><br><p>The One-Eyed Serpent Archer’s gaze filled with confusion, he was unsure of the Blind Sinner’s plan, but the commander’s orders were above his will.
</p><br><p>The other archers were in the same situation, so having no other choice, they aimed their bows towards the flames, quickly absorbing them.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, the barriers around the towers weakened, without the flames they didn’t have even half their strength.
</p><br><p>The four archers began preparing for the most powerful shot of the entire Eclipse. Their hands trembled as the energy from the flames gradually transformed into arrows shaking from the power.
</p><br><p>At this stage, the arrows were comparable to the Dormant Lord’s plasma spears or even surpassed them in destructive potency, but the Blind Sinner wasn’t going to put all the work on the archers, his plan was different.
</p><br><br><p>As before, the archers fired simultaneously, aiming at four different points. Their targets were not monsters or some Phantom squad but places far enough away from the fortress but not too close to the hills between the two borders.
</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump.
</p><br><p>Without delay, the arrows landed with their tips sinking into the sand, but they didn’t explode. They were strong and stable enough not to burst with every collision and that was exactly what the Blind Sinner wanted.
</p><br><p>The monsters near the arrows became wary, they hurriedly moved away, not wanting to be too close to the epicenter of the explosion, it could happen at any moment.
</p><br><p>Hunger and thirst appeared in their eyes, each arrow was a valuable source of energy, but the risks were too great. Perhaps the Dormant Lord would not be afraid to absorb an arrow, but right now he was busy.
</p><br><p>Watching the weakened archers, the Blind Sinner nodded contentedly. They had done their job, now it was his turn.
</p><br><br><p>Returning to the center of the spire, the Blind Sinner smiled bitterly before thrusting his sword straight into the center.
</p><br><p>His chains clenched tightly around his arms, as his blue eyes shone brightly like ghostly lanterns.
</p><br><p>Blue streams of energy, cold and calm, traveled downward, spreading out along the spire and throughout the fortress.
</p><br><p>Then, a bright flash from the top of the spire illuminated the lands once more, causing the fortress to shake vigorously.
</p><br><p>The great ice was about to rise, wanting to protect its home, to become a fortress for the fortress.</p>
