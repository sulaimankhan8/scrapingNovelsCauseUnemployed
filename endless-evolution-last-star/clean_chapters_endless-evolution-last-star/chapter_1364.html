            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1364: The Only Spear</strong></p><br><p>“Adam… We must return to the original plan.” Silvana’s voice echoed in Adam’s head.</p><br><p>He nodded deeply as he watched dozens of wyverns undergo a kind of evolution. Sure, the dark chains and silver wing signs only gave the monsters temporary power, but that didn’t matter when they had more than enough time to deal with a single opponent.</p><br><p>“Yeah, I don’t think I have enough power to kill every single one of them. But where is the special item for this trial? I tried to find it, but I couldn’t!” Adam looked around in a last attempt to notice something unusual.</p><br><p>“Let’s stick to the tactics we used in the first trial. Perhaps the wyverns know where the weapon capable of destroying the red heart is. In that case, they will avoid a certain area.”</p><br><p>Adam frowned slightly but nodded anyway.</p><br><p>“To be honest, I’m not sure if this will work. It would be too easy, but what other choice do I have, right?”</p><br><p>That was all the time they had as the wyverns went through their evolution.</p><br><p>Moreover, the Azure Wyvern was ready for its next attack.</p><br><br><p>With a deafening roar, dark chains burst out of the portals again, but this time they all headed for Adam, as did dozens of wyverns.</p><br><p>If before, Adam could have fought off the wyverns with the Future of the Past, now, even with the full power of the Evolution Vein, it was not possible.</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam made the only right decision — to run.</p><br><br><p>He flapped his wings to escape the dark chains, which were even faster than the wyverns, as if they wanted to grab him and turn him into one of the followers of this dark force.</p><br><p>‘Shit! Shit! Shit! Silvana, we need to find the weapon right now!’ Adam exclaimed internally as he dodged the dark chains.</p><br><p>But, immediately after that, two wyverns appeared in front of him, their jaws wide open. In a heartbeat, the purple blasts flew towards him, reflecting in his wide-open eyes.</p><br><br><p>The explosion of the purple flame shook the space as Adam escaped the fire at the last moment. A drop of blood dripped from his forehead under his heavy breathing.</p><br><p>The next few seconds became a real-life-or-death situation for Adam. He had to dodge the chains and reflect the wyverns’ attacks, while the Azure Wyvern created new chains.</p><br><br><p>One attack after another, Adam struggled to keep up, flying from one point to another while the many icy peaks in his path were destroyed by the shockwave.</p><br><p>However, Adam couldn’t run forever.</p><br><p>It wasn’t the dark chains or the wyverns, but the guard who finally folded its wings and opened its jaw.</p><br><p>Adam’s pupils narrowed as the Azure Wyvern fired a purple energy ray at him, completely unlike the frosty one he had dodged at the very beginning of their battle.</p><br><p>Naturally, Adam directed all his strength into dodging this attack, but he was too slow even with his black wings.</p><br><p>“ARGH!” With a painful shout, the purple ray reached Adam.</p><br><p>The ray plunged Adam deep below the level of the bridge, causing him to crash into the ice peaks with his back, one after another, until the purple ray released all its destructive power in an instant.</p><br><br><p>A shockwave ran through the space from the fiery explosion, causing the dark chains and wyverns to soar into the air.</p><br><p>They stared intently at the wisps of smoke, wanting to know if Adam was still alive.</p><br><p>“Gha!” Adam coughed, spitting out a clot of blood. “Fuck…”</p><br><p>He slowly got up, looking around.</p><br><p>He was lying on a broken ice peak, at its base, which was now covered in blood, his blood. Just a few meters below was a calm yet frightening white void.</p><br><p>“Shit, if I hadn’t stopped here, I would have fallen in… and then what would have happened?”</p><br><p>Adam gulped, not wanting to think about it as he looked up to see what his opponents were doing.</p><br><p>A bright light interfered with him, blinding him for a brief glimpse.</p><br><p>“Damn! I can’t see anything!” Adam waved his hand as his expression froze. “Wait… That light… Where is it coming from?”</p><br><p>He stared at a single crystal at the very top of the third trial.</p><br><p>“It was here from the beginning… It’s… Silvana, it’s it!”</p><br><p>Before Silvana could respond, Adam flapped his wings and flew upward.</p><br><p>The wyverns tried to stop him, but the silver threads stood in their way, causing them to collide. The chains were much faster and dodged the threads, but Adam used all his strength to reach the top as quickly as possible.</p><br><p>“There’s nothing but emptiness below, but there’s this light. If I were hiding a weapon somewhere, this would be the best place!”</p><br><p>When Adam got close enough to the crystal, the light completely blinded him, as if he were moving toward the sun itself.</p><br><br><p>But as soon as his hand touched the hard surface, a satisfied smile appeared on his face.</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam punched the crystal with all his might.</p><br><p>Shards flew in all directions as the bright light disappeared, instantly plunging the third trial ground into darkness.</p><br><p>Still, light emanated from one spot, and that spot was right in front of Adam.</p><br><p>A long spear with a stone handle and a wide blade, glowing with an amber light like the core of the sun.</p><br><br><p>Adam grabbed the spear by the handle. “If anything can destroy this heart, it’s this!”</p><br><br><p>A spear with a light bright enough to turn night into day, even if it is only an illusion, but many will be willing to believe it. The light contained within this weapon will dispel any darkness, whether for good or evil.]</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The red heart trembled violently, sensing the threat. It began to expel all its energy in an attempt to defend itself.</p><br><p>It was already too late.</p><br><p>With a fiery gaze, Adam threw the Amber Sun Spear with all his might, watching as the fiery sun would soon destroy the glacier and its darkness.</p><br><p>This battle between darkness and light would be the last condition for him to find what he came here for.</p>
