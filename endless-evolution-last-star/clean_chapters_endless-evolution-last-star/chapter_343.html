            <br><p>"Oh... What a strange feeling..." Silvana muttered looking at Adam, who now for some reason looked completely different.</p><br><p>There was literally power, sacrifice, and anger radiating from him.</p><br><p>She knew well what Adam was capable of, and realized that he was able to achieve this state by putting his body under serious pressure.</p><br><p>However... whereas before she would have been very nervous about him and would have asked him to worry about his condition, now she had very different thoughts and desires.</p><br><p>She wanted to see Adam fight. She wanted to see what his new, lofty look was capable of.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Electric shocks ran through his body, and his hair rose, rippling slowly from side to side while the tips of his feet hovered above the ground.</p><br><p>Adam's lips came into motion, but his voice was so quiet that no one heard what he said except... Plague Reaper.</p><br><br><p>The word pierced Plague Reaper's mind before Adam leaned forward.</p><br><p>His speed remained the same, but his attitude towards the situation had completely changed. No matter what would happen to his legs later, right now it was important to use their power to the limit. However, considering how much his muscles were strained, his physical capabilities had actually gotten a bit higher.</p><br><p>A black streak was left behind Adam, from the dozens of electric shocks that hit the ground after his swift, powerful strides.</p><br><p>Before Plague Reaper had time to realize anything, a long silver needle passed in front of his face, leaving a deep horizontal cut on his nose.</p><br><p>A few drops of blood trickled outward, slowly passing in front of his baffled eyes.</p><br><br><p>Four long claws, cut through the droplets, quickly heading straight for Plague Reaper's face. Remembering perfectly well how easily Adam's needle had cut his nose, Plague Reaper was fully aware of what would happen if Adam's claws reached their target. He couldn't let that happen!</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's coat shuddered, causing his sleeves to become much longer and cover his arms, turning into his gloves.</p><br><p>Then, two creepy jaws opened on the black gloves, with long, sharp teeth and an insidious grin wanting to devour everything in its path.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper let out a sigh like a quick swipe before swinging his right arm, exposing his wide-open jaw to the silver claws.</p><br><p>The cascades of sparks flew off to the sides while white teeth gnashed against the silver claws, trying to tear each other apart.</p><br><p>Then, Adam turned the torso, bringing his needle in for the attack.</p><br><p>The Plague Reaper's pupils narrowed. He turned around sharply, bringing his second glove under the blast.</p><br><br><p>His jaw clenched tightly around the needle, trying to gnaw on it like some kind of bone, but it was more like a dog trying to tear through a steel rod. It was completely useless and only dangerous to the dog's fangs, but nothing to the steel rod.</p><br><br><p>Adam lifted one leg slightly before bouncing off the ground with the other. While in the air, he spun sharply like an electric whirlwind, causing Plague Reaper's eyes to move panickedly from side to side in an attempt to keep track of Adam's movements.</p><br><p>Silver claws touched the ground, leaving four scratches on the stone floor before Adam's right foot slammed right into Plague Reaper's face.</p><br><p>Neither his jaws nor his sturdy coat could protect him from such a thing. It was a direct hit that sent a violent recoil through his entire body.</p><br><br><p>The Plague Reaper flew aside, plunging into the wall with a deafening crash. A high, thick cloud of dust rose, and nothing could be seen beyond it, only the Plague Reaper's blurry silhouette.</p><br><p>The Fume Armors standing around glanced around. They may have wanted to help their lord, but they wouldn't do anything without orders. They only watched the exquisite battle developing in front of them.</p><br><p>Like humans, monsters loved the spectacle and adored violence. It was something mesmerizing, real, and unique, especially when both fighters were worthy of watching.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>Before the dust cloud could disperse even a little, Adam charged in at full speed, about to pierce the silhouette with his claws and needle.</p><br><br><p>There was a loud clang as if from the clash of two iron swords. The sound wave quickly spread around, scattering a cloud of dust and revealing two creatures aiming to kill each other.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's hands were actively shaking, the jaws on his gauntlets struggling to withstand the pressure from Adam's needle and silver claws.</p><br><p>"Hey, didn't you hear me? I told you, beware." Adam whispered before increasing the pressure, moving slightly closer to Plague Reaper, who had to hold his hands to his chest.</p><br><br><p>Adam's right leg came into motion, his knee plunging like a hammer into Plague Reaper's stomach, forcing the latter's muscles into a veritable inferno in an attempt to mitigate the damage in any way.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper let out a growl. Blood rushed from his mouth, coating the ground, but despite the bright, piercing pain, his arms didn't flinch.</p><br><p>All his instincts screamed that if he relaxed for even a moment if he took his hands away, Adam's claws and the needle would tear him apart. Adam would simply gash his stomach like a hunter would do to his prey after a successful hunt.</p><br><p>"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh..."</p><br><p>Plague Reaper opened his mouth wide, letting out a huge amount of black air. That one was much darker and denser than the one he used to kill Fog Hunter.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment, but streams of blue wind still swept in front of him. Osana's ability was working properly, it should have protected him from the death that was slowly approaching him with a light current of air.</p><br><p>'Maybe I should back off?'</p><br><p>A thought flashed through Adam's mind. But, he dismissed it as quickly as it had appeared.</p><br><p>'No, thanks to Osana's ability I can keep pushing further. Just a little more and he won't be able to take it anymore, just a little more and his arms will fall!' Adam inwardly exclaimed, with full determination to continue further.</p><br><p>He could see that the black air was gradually passing through the wind veil, but this danger could not stop him.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, coming out of nowhere, a long root curled around Adam's waist.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam's eyes went wide in confusion.</p><br><p>The root threw him aside, as far away from the Plague Reaper as possible.</p>
