            <br><br><p>Adam and Heret turned into shadows, bouncing off the great Light Goliath's shoulders.</p><br><p>The archers immediately fired - arrows capable of demolishing dozens of houses in their path were heading straight for them.</p><br><p>But, as Adam had said earlier, they were too small to be hit by something so huge.</p><br><p>Concentrating the energy and flames above them, Adam and Heret created a small explosion. It was more than enough to throw them down, just a few meters.</p><br><p>At the same moment, stone arrows swept over them, causing raging torrents of wind.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Heret landed as they turned back.</p><br><br><p>The arrows plunged halfway into the bridge, the broken furrows spreading apart, throwing up debris, each one large enough to crush a man in a bloody spot.</p><br><p>"Damn, if they'd been a little more accurate, there'd be nothing left of us." Adam scratched the back of his head, genuinely impressed. "That's like killing a fly with a cannonball."</p><br><br><p>The destruction wrought by arrows didn't interest him as much as the core in the warrior goliath's chest.</p><br><p>"So, my theory turned out to be true."</p><br><p>"Yeah, looks like it, but... I was expecting to see something huge. A core the size of a hill!"</p><br><p>"I too, but maybe that's good news. The core is small, which means one damage would be enough to weaken or kill this guy. A larger core would be much stronger and could function in separate sectors."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment. Unlike him, Heret knew quite a bit about cores and energy. It was useful knowledge, even during battle.</p><br><p>However, the warrior goliath was not going to wait for them to discuss their next moves. He pulled his battle hammer from the ground with a shudder, staring intently at Adam as his main opponent.</p><br><p>"Hah, can you feel whose aura is more powerful? I'm flattered." Adam smirked. "But, it doesn't matter. We're going to go further with just the two of us."</p><br><p>Exchanging a glance, Adam and Heret rushed forward.</p><br><p>Before the goliath could realize it, they had climbed onto his knees, then jumped to chest level, grasping the sharp edges of his armor.</p><br><p>The golden light from the core fell on their faces, trembling slightly as if the core knew its existence was about to end.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the warrior goliath's size was once again his main curse. He simply couldn't have time to change his grip and grab Adam and Heret to save his core.</p><br><p>Simultaneously, Adam plunged the needle into the golden core as Heret made a sharp strike with his green flame.</p><br><p>Under the pressure of the two powerful, precise attacks, the core cracked.</p><br><p>A bright light with energy streams rushed out, causing Adam and Heret to squeeze their eyes shut.</p><br><p>Then, their faces turned pale as they retreated as fast as they could. The next moment, they were a few meters in front of the warrior goliath.</p><br><br><p>The huge monster collapsed on one knee. The shockwave traveled across the bridge, rippling Adam's black hair tips.</p><br><p>The warrior goliath let go of his weapon, clutching at his chest. He tried to heal his wound, though it was already too late.</p><br><p>Golden streams of energy were actively flowing outward, as the glow grew stronger and stronger before the approaching explosion.</p><br><p>Then, an amber flash illuminated the entire bridge, turning the great goliath into nothing more than pieces of armor scattered across the surface.</p><br><p>Adam and Heret gathered energy in front of them to shield themselves from the shockwave.</p><br><p>The next time they opened their eyes, they saw a wide crater at the beginning of the bridge and two shocked archers. Their hands were shaking, they didn't know what they were supposed to do.</p><br><p>But, as Adam and Heret rushed forward, they set their bows on the ground and prepared to fire.</p><br><p>However, the goliath no longer had a chance of winning, not after Adam and Heret had figured out their weak spots.</p><br><p>After all, they were two S4 monsters, not the S5 ones, practically invincible ones.</p><br><p>Adam and Heret split up - each taking on one archer.</p><br><p>Arrows launched directly at them when they were at a dangerous distance for the archers, but being on the ground, Adam and Heret dodged easily.</p><br><p>They bounced off the edge of the bridge, cleaving the protective plates on the archers' chests in a sharp motion.</p><br><p>Their cores were slightly smaller than the warrior's, and the almost imperceptible difference in size was strongly felt in the density of their auras.</p><br><p>'Damn...' Adam internally muttered thrusting the needle straight into the golden core. 'If the warrior's core was two or three times bigger, he'd probably be an S5 Monster.'</p><br><br><p>Adam pulled the needle out of the archer's chest. Heret finished off his opponent as well.</p><br><p>"So... Now just go ahead, right?" Adam gulped, glaring at the silhouette in the distance. The hundreds of columns tried to hide it.</p><br><p>Heret nodded uncertainly. He was considerably more nervous than Adam.</p><br><p>The Light Goliaths were nothing compared to Arnoth. Heret knew that, and it was obvious to Adam by their power.</p><br><p>"Yes, let's not waste any time. Risha and Vorx's fight should be in the middle of it by now. We have to get started. We must face Arnoth, sooner or later, this moment had to come."</p><br><p>Adam nodded as they moved forward.</p><br><p>Not a minute later they passed through many columns and found themselves in the center of the throne room, the most important place in all of Fallen Ring Castle.</p><br><p>They stopped right in front of the throne - a powerful, calm aura full of majesty held them still.</p><br><p>A shadow concealed the great silhouette despite the bright light around it, the throne did not want the unworthy ones to see the new king.</p><br><p>Adam and Heret flinched - two amber eyes glared at them, differently. Arnoth considered as a worthy opponent only one of them, the other was nothing more than a sacrifice for the sake of warming up.</p><br><br><p>Arnoth's heavy voice rang out, carrying throughout the throne room.</p><br><p>"You're here at last. You, Heret... a serpent that could not defend his home, and you, a young Phantom..."</p><br><p>His eyes stopped on Adam.</p><br><p>"I'm glad you came, though... I won't hide it. Your naivete saddens me. I doubt you've ever seen the power that comes from antiquity..."</p>
