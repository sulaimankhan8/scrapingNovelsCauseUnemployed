            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1381: Long Stair</strong></p><br><p>Adam was going to head for the gray tower in the very center of the island, which was a natural extension of the White Spire.</p><br><p>It was the only route available to him. He had to meet with the Silver Beacon to return to the Forgotten Mills. Either way, she was the link between this island and the misty lands.</p><br><p>[Wait… Before you leave…]</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam turned to the dark orb.</p><br><p>[There is something you should know… Perhaps it is time for this island to undergo some changes… small ones, but with hope for the future… Now is the only right moment for this, if you help me, of course…]</p><br><p>Adam smiled happily.</p><br><p>A cunning plan after a hard battle? That was just what he needed!</p><br><p>“Tell me what to do!”</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Bertrada was nervous, pacing in circles in the glass sphere and biting her nails.</p><br><p>Sure, it wasn’t the first time a contender had passed all her trials, despite her desperate attempts to prevent it. But until now, she had always been in control of the situation, even if she lost.</p><br><br><p>“Shit, shit, shit! Even after taking the trial of the White Spire, he still managed to survive? What the hell is going on in this land?! Fuck!”</p><br><p>Mona didn’t dare show it, but she was glad Adam had survived. They and Bertrada could clearly see how bright and powerful the flash was when the dark dome fell.</p><br><p>They didn’t know what was happening inside the dark dome, but they understood that it wasn’t something simple, it just couldn’t be.</p><br><p>At that moment, Mona’s eyes stopped on Adam, who was limping toward the tower.</p><br><p>“Adam… Will the moment you spoke of happen? I’m used to my life, but… for some reason, looking at you, I feel that you are capable of doing what I cannot, even if you are only a guest here.”</p><br><p>Bertrada grabbed her hair in frustration.</p><br><p>“Tsk! Let that little bastard come here and get his reward! After that, I don’t want to see him or Norax ever again in my life!”</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Adam reached the main gate of the tower as he placed one palm on it and easily set the heavy slabs in motion.</p><br><p>This simple action reminded him that he still had a long way to go before reaching the Second Rank.</p><br><p>“Hah, even now I feel invincible, although I understand that this is far from the case. Still…” Adam pressed on the gate, stepping forward. “Phantoms and monsters evolve differently, right? And the Hybrids… The differences between them are not that great, but there are some important details.”</p><br><p>After Adam obtained the Desire of Beyond, he realized how much stronger he could become. He didn’t know what would happen when he obtained the Dark Heart; for now, it remained a mystery to him, but he understood that it would be another step toward his power.</p><br><p>Perhaps not as unique as the Desire of Beyond, but it would help him create the Second Grand Star.</p><br><p>“I doubt that the Second Grand Star will be the last for my constellation. But maybe it will end with the third? Moreover…” Adam’s eyes deepened. “What is the power of the constellation? What awaits me when I collect it?”</p><br><p>Adam did not forget that everything he was doing now was the path of every K4-Phantom. Sure, many failed by choosing the wrong star at the Path Construct, but he was sure that this would not happen to him for one simple reason.</p><br><p>‘Most likely, few people made a mistake with the First Grand Star. I’m not sure if it’s even possible. But when you fulfill all the conditions and practically die several times in the process, you want to choose the next star more easily, right?’</p><br><p>A bitter smile appeared on Adam’s face.</p><br><p>‘It’s easy to tell which star is easier and which is harder, especially when you need something specific. So, the Third Grand Star shouldn’t be a problem, but… What is the barrier at the very end that prevents a large number of K4-Phantoms from reaching the Second Rank?’</p><br><p>Adam didn’t know many K4-Phantoms who were at the peak of their powers. One of them was Orel, Risha’s older brother and also one of the captains of the Red Bears.</p><br><p>He had been at this level for a long time, as had Lorana, Hygon, and the captains of other factions of the Lower Ring. However, only a few managed to take the final step on the path to true power and stand on equal footing with Phantoms such as the heads of the Twelve Branches.</p><br><p>“Well, you have to solve problems as they come, right?” Adam smiled as the light from the moon passing through the half-open gate lit his way.</p><br><br><p>Adam moved forward as his smile quickly faded, replaced by a grim expression.</p><br><br><p>Instead of a platform or elevator like at the trials, a staircase awaited him, with thousands of steps leading to the very top.</p><br><p>Deep below, there was only darkness separating the gray tower from the White Spire, the territory of the trials.</p><br><br><p>With a slight tremor, Silvana appeared next to Adam and gently touched his shoulder.</p><br><p>“I would suggest just jumping to the top with the help of energy, but…” Her eyes scanned him. “In this state, it would be foolish and even dangerous, right?”</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand with a yawn.</p><br><p>“Nah, I’m fine. When was the last time I climbed stairs? Shit!” Adam stamped his foot. “Why now? How many steps are there anyway?”</p><br><p>Silvana smiled and closed her eyes, continuing to watch him from afar.</p><br><p>For her, the events that had taken place had brought significant changes as well. After all, she too was part of the Evolution Tree to some extent, and now there was a new player here who was very different from her or Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>‘Well, the Silver Weaver looks like a worthy ally. However, did all the K4-Phantoms go through this? Does that mean they all got the Desire of Beyond, and it looks like their first monster, or… did it happen just for Adam?’</p>
