            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1319: Crimson scar on the sky</strong></p><br><br><p>Adam walked forward along the long passageway, surrounded only by cold walls of dark bricks and blue torches lighting his way.</p><br><p>He learned as much as he could about his situation from Misty and Karso, at least for now, that was the maximum. If he wanted to somehow fix his situation and move on, he had to get advice from Norax, whom he was heading to right now.</p><br><p>The underground chambers were connected not only to rooms and halls, but also to many mills. Norax’s mill was one of the exceptions to this rule; Adam would have to walk to it on the ground. However, Misty instructed him on where to go to reach the exit and Norax’s mill the fastest.</p><br><p>At the same time, Misty and Karso had the opportunity to discuss the awakening of the young Phantom, who was able to surprise even such powerful monsters as themselves.</p><br><p>“So… Hah, just one damn month?” Karso chuckled, shaking his head as if he couldn’t believe what he was saying.</p><br><p>Misty took a sip of coffee, staring intently at one spot.</p><br><p>“Yes, it was unexpected. Most importantly, neither you nor I even felt his aura when he appeared. We just noticed him like ordinary creatures, just with our eyes.”</p><br><p>Karso crossed his arms over his chest, nodding thoughtfully from time to time.</p><br><p>“Yeah, because he was at absolute zero. He was supposed to wake up in two months, or at most a month and a half, then his body would have had time to gather some energy. We would have known he woke up as soon as he opened his eyes. However… It all happened much faster, didn’t it?”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Misty sighed.</p><br><p>“Because he woke up as soon as his body was able to do so. Neither he nor his body of the Evolution Tree cared that if he woke up so early, he would have no energy at all. Based on his words, his Energy Axis is in terrible condition, yet there is no fatigue or weakness in his gaze, only a burning fire.”</p><br><p>Karso put his hands behind his head and stretched his back.</p><br><p>“Well, what can I say? Ordinary Phantoms don’t come to our lands, and he reached his level in just a year, considering that in the last 10 years before the World Wipe, the world had the lowest concentration of energy. It’s impressive, what can I say?”</p><br><p>“Now, I even feel sorry for Ureyn,” Misty muttered. “He thinks he has another six months at best to reach his previous level and give Adam a rematch. Given the circumstances, I doubt that will happen anytime soon.”</p><br><p>Karso shrugged with a carefree expression.</p><br><p>“Let’s see how long it takes him to restore his Energy Axis. I was surprised that the boss decided to take care of this personally. Adam really caught his interest.”</p><br><p>This time, Misty said nothing, she just nodded, wanting to finish her coffee.</p><br><p>All they could hope for was that Adam’s appearance in their lands would bring them another interesting event or two to at least somewhat alleviate their boredom until the next World Wipe.</p><br><p>If the first ten years after the World Wipe were usually the most interesting and full of opportunities, the last ten years had been the most boring. Except for rare cases, few of the grand powerhouses dared to take active measures that could affect other big players in this world.</p><br><p>These were the rules that all the most powerful beings had grown accustomed to, from the Lords, their various levels, and, of course, the Second Rank Phantoms.</p><br><p>Everyone tried to find ways to entertain themselves or spend their endless time on something. Thus, Misty’s culinary skills were not so rare among the Lords who lived in the monster societies.</p><br><p>And even the strongest monsters at the Forgotten Mills were no exception to this rule.</p><br><br><p>Adam emerged from the underground passageway into a dark field, somewhat similar to Ureyn’s wind plain, but it looked strange, as if life and death themselves had found peace in this place.</p><br><p>Perhaps the reason for this was the majestic mill, like a tower from a nightmare rising above the field, reflecting crimson light on everyone who decided to enter its territory.</p><br><p>However, that crimson light did not belong to the dark mill ahead, it came from a source that was much further away and had greater significance than all the Forgotten Mills lands.</p><br><p>Adam turned as his gaze wandered far ahead to lands that were dozens of kilometers away from the Forgotten Mills, but still exerted their influence on part of this territory.</p><br><p>When Adam crossed the Glass Bridge, he knew he was going to a place with a different region, and that region, which meant a new level of threat to the Tarnished Lands, was the Blighted Scar Lands.</p><br><p>There was only one reason for this name, and Adam was looking at it right now.</p><br><p>The great scar, like a cut in the world, divided the dark sky, casting crimson light on dozens of territories under its influence.</p><br><p>This was the zone of the Renegades, and even the Forgotten Mills were no exception to this rule.</p><br><p>As Gareyna had said earlier, part of the Forgotten Mills, namely the Black Cut side, was in constant contact with the monsters from the Renegades, either to cooperate or to resolve conflicts quickly and efficiently.</p><br><p>The Renegades did not complicate things and simply followed simple rules – all the land on which the light from the crimson scar fell had to be under their supervision.</p><br><p>This did not mean that they controlled or, even more so, ruled these lands, although there were such cases, but they were simply aware of what was happening there.</p><br><p>Whether they wanted to or not, the Renegades were too powerful to allow uncontrolled chaos to arise around them.</p><br><p>“So, is this what Gareyna was talking about?”</p><br><p>Adam muttered, looking at the frightening and at the same time alluring crimson scar cutting through the night sky.</p><br><p>“Is this the Blighted Scar Lands? The Renegades… If they are equal in strength to factions such as the Free End and the Befallen Crown, then there are truly threatening monsters among them.”</p><br><p>Thanks to the First Star’s will, Adam arrived at the Dark Shore much earlier than a Phantom like him should have. Only the strongest K4-Phantoms had the opportunity to travel to the Dark Shore from time to time for dangerous but important missions for the Citadel.</p><br><p>Being a weak K3-Phantom, he had the opportunity to see what monsters such as Kenward and Saegar, as well as Wilfred, were capable of, although his participation in the battle was rather short.</p><br><p>After spending a few more minutes admiring the crimson scar and the many cities that fell under its light, Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>“Alright, that’s enough. I can’t waste any more time on this. Misty said that Norax would tell me more about the Energy Axis.”</p><br><p>Then, he turned around, raising his gaze to the top of the majestic mill in front of him.</p><br><br><p>Only now did Adam realize how enormous Norax’s mill was. It was several times larger than Gareyna’s and dozens of times larger than Ureyn’s. If not for its tower shape, this mill could have been a real castle for a lonely king in terms of size.</p><br><p>Adam moved forward. He had no choice but to meet Norax, but…</p><br><p>As soon as Adam passed through the massive gates that were already open, he stopped and looked around.</p><br><p>Ahead of him were numerous passages and staircases leading high up, like in a real castle or ancient military fort.</p><br><p>‘Misty didn’t mention anything about this. Tsk, if she knew that Norax’s mill was a real maze, couldn’t she have given me more detailed explanations?!’</p><br><p>However, Adam soon received the help he needed.</p><br><p>“Did you want something, young man?”</p><br><p>A calm, feminine voice came from nearby.</p><br><p>Adam turned sharply as he noticed a middle-aged woman standing next to the gate. She had platinum hair curled at her shoulders and piercing blue eyes.</p><br><p>Unlike all the monsters at the Forgotten Mills he had seen before, she was dressed in a strict outfit—a black and red maid’s uniform, formal and tight with a short skirt.</p><br><p>She did not own this mill; she could not, even though her aura was as strong as Ureyn’s, even in a calm state. It was unknown how powerful this woman really was.</p><br><br><p>“I came here from Misty… Misty and Karso. My name is Adam Vinter. I fought recently at the String Duel.”</p><br><p>As soon as he explained everything, the woman’s eyes flashed.</p><br><p>“Oh, so this is what you look like. Unfortunately, I couldn’t watch your fight against Mr. Ureyn, but I’m sure it was an impressive sight. So, you came here to meet Mr. Norax, right?”</p><br><p>“Yes, Misty sent me here. She said she told me everything I needed to know and that Norax would take care of me.” Adam scratched the back of his head.</p><br><br><p>“I see that happened faster than I expected. Please follow me.”</p><br><p>After climbing several flights of stairs, they found themselves in front of a large door.</p><br><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p><br><p>The woman knocked on the door as they entered.</p><br><p>“DAMN IT!” Norax exclaimed angrily, sitting cross-legged on the floor.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened when he realized the reason for such a reaction.</p><br><br><p>The words flashed in large red letters on the big screen while Norax held the gamepad in his hands.</p><br><p>“Oh.” He turned around as a smirk spread across his face. “Narica, did you really bring Adam to me?”</p><br><br><br><p>“Good, although I didn’t think I’d have to be distracted so soon.”</p>
