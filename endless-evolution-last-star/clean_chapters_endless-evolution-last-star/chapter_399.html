            <br><p>Adam stared intently at Damien, pondering his next actions.</p><br><p>At this time, Damien glanced at his black rod. Strangely enough, the dense thread could leave a tiny scratch on it. It seemed to be unremarkable, but that was not the case at all.</p><br><p>'Well, well, if he knew which monster this rod previously belonged to, pride would fill his heart. Although... he still hasn't thrown the hat off me. I wonder how he plans to do that? I hope he succeeds otherwise, I'll be disappointed.' Damien thought as a slight smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>He expected Adam to try and attack again. Sure, Adam was going to keep on, but this sparring had taught him that there was no point in trying something that failed, not always, but against Damien for sure.</p><br><p>Damien already had no trouble dodging his attack, playing with his thread as if it were a trinket rather than a deadly weapon. Such an opponent had to be surprised and taken off guard because if Damien dodged once, he would easily do it a hundred more.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>An electric horn appeared from the right side of Adam's head as electric shocks traveled throughout his body.</p><br><p>"Hmm? You think you can beat me with speed?" Damien tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>He saw Adam use his artifact a few times, so he was aware of Adam's capabilities.</p><br><p>Damien thought that Adam had decided to attack again with the needle and knock his hat off in close combat with quick attacks.</p><br><p>Adam shook his head, showing that Damien was wrong.</p><br><p>"You taught me that I should move faster to new ways to win, so... that's exactly what I'm doing." Adam said before swinging his thread once more.</p><br><p>Damien tilted his head. He didn't understand what Adam was talking about. Damien had seen this ability and attack before, so this was nothing new.</p><br><p>'Well, it seems despite what he said, he's still trying to use the old methods. Agh, I guess another defeat could bring him to his senses.' Damien thought before looking at the thread approaching him.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, he figured out the trajectory of the thread and prepared to dodge. The thread was aiming for his neck, but Damien wasn't going to stand still.</p><br><p>'Fine, I'll just duck, the thread will fly over my hat and then I'll run up to him throwing strikes after which he'll need Dahla's help.'</p><br><p>Damien's legs flexed slightly as his body began to lower to reach the right height, but... at the same time, an aggressive blue flash reflected in Damien's green eyes.</p><br><p>Confusion consumed Damien's mind for a moment. At first, he thought that Adam had somehow gotten closer to him, but... no, Adam was still in his place.</p><br><p>The electricity covering his entire body traveled along his arm, running lightning-fast through the entire thread. The speed of the electrical discharges was hundreds of times faster than the thread, so the thread had already become much quicker due to the electricity effect.</p><br><p>A slight chill ran down Damien's back as he couldn't completely dodge this attack, the thread was too fast. He just didn't expect that Adam could use his electricity in such a way.</p><br><p>Sure, if Damien was in his normal state, then he wouldn't have feared such an attack, but right now, he was at the lower limit of the K2-Level. Considering how powerful Adam's thread was, a successful attack would simply blow Damien's head off.</p><br><br><p>Damien bent his body at a strange angle, allowing the thread to pass right over his chest. His astonished eyes reflected the dense thread sparkling with electricity, whose tip with more power was a little farther away.</p><br><p>With perfect control over his body, Damien managed to dodge, but... in the rush of emotions, he forgot that he should protect something else besides himself.</p><br><br><p>A muffled thump sounded behind him as the tip of the thread crashed into his hat. A moment later, the thread carrying the hat collapsed against the wall, leaving wide cracks, the hat was blown to shreds, it couldn't be repaired.</p><br><p>Damien fell to the ground, not attempting to do it accurately or to lean on his hands.</p><br><br><p>Not believing his eyes, Damien slowly raised his right hand, touching his head and his slicked-back hair for disguise, only then did he realize that his hat wasn't really there.</p><br><p>It couldn't be said that this hat possessed any special value, at least that was the case until Adam and Damien started fighting. It was a milestone that Adam had to overcome to make Damien serious and he did it.</p><br><p>Silvana smiled contentedly.</p><br><p>Experience tales at empire</p><br><p>'Hah, even if Damien is the strongest, with so many limitations he won't be able to resist Adam. I'm sure once Adam gets used to his abilities he will become much stronger.'</p><br><p>Dahla narrowed her eyes looking at the destruction from Adam's attack.</p><br><p>"I have to admit... it's impressive."</p><br><p>A wide grin passed across Douglas's face.</p><br><p>"Hahahahahahahaha! Damien, it's been a long time since I've seen you this confused, what fun!"</p><br><p>Douglas laughed, unable to contain his emotions.</p><br><p>"Hah, yeah... you're right." Damien nodded.</p><br><p>He wasn't offended that he lost his hat, on the contrary, in a way he was waiting and hoping for it to happen, as it raised his personal interest.</p><br><p>"This may sound unnecessarily arrogant, but I think after this we can consider the score changed to 2:1, don't you?" Adam lifted his chin confidently as the thread returned to his ring.</p><br><p>Then, the ring disappeared as well. Adam wasn't about to slow down, but aside from the difficulty of use, Silver Threads had another significant drawback - monstrous energy consumption. Adam decided not to turn off the artifact's ability for now.</p><br><p>In total, Adam only made three attacks, one multiple threads and two dense threads, which was enough for him to decide to cancel the ability.</p><br><p>'Damn... The potential of Silver Threads is huge, but from the looks of it, I won't be able to use at least five threads at the same time for a while yet. Well, I still have something I haven't used.' Adam pondered.</p><br><p>Of all his new abilities, the effects of Elemental Root, Nexus, and his Power Gene remained untouched.</p><br><p>And... this was where Adam ran into a problem. For some reason, he still had no sense of how to activate them, as if the information about them was hidden behind a misty veil.</p><br><p>'Agh, I guess that won't be a problem. After all, these are my abilities.'</p><br><br><p>At this time, Damien took a few steps forward with a satisfied smile on his face.</p><br><p>"2:1, you say? Fine, that sounds fair, but... It's going to get a lot harder now, for you..." Damien said wryly as his hands reached upward.</p><br><p>With chaotic movements, Damien began to muss his hair, giving it a natural shape.</p><br><p>His hat had been destroyed, so there was no point in him maintaining his disguise any longer.</p><br><p>But... This move mattered far more than just Damien's comfort.</p><br><p>"I hope you're willing to lose, as I have no desire to hold back."</p><br><p>As soon as those words came out of Damien's mouth, his green eyes changed, as if becoming brighter and filled with new power.</p><br><p>The energy spread through Damien's body, unknowingly spreading some of his aura around.</p><br><p>Everyone felt a shiver and a chill down their backs, neither Douglas nor Dahla were exceptions. No matter what they went through, no matter how experienced or strong they were, in front of Damien's power it didn't matter.</p><br><p>After a moment the effect passed, but it was enough to make Silvana's legs shake and she fell to her knees.</p><br><p>'No way... It's not even his true strength after all, just the effect of his K2-Level energy...' Silvana internally muttered.</p><br><br><p>"Impressive... Hey, now besides K2-Level, you only have one limitation left, you don't use abilities. What do I have to do for that? You don't have a hat anymore, you know?"</p><br><p>Damien smirked, clenching his fist tightly. He already knew the answer to that question.</p><br><p>"Blood. Let me bleed, if you do that then I'll use my powers. Though... if I were you, I'd hope that doesn't happen."</p><br><p>Damien waved his hand before heading forward, the moment his foot touched the stone slab it cracked as if Damien's step weighed a few tons. This was a consequence of the considerable amount of energy he had put into this step.</p><br><p>Energy always filled the Phantoms' bodies and its main use was to activate abilities.</p><br><p>Thus, letting his energy flow through his body, Damien gained a new power that he had previously restricted as he waited for Adam to knock the hat off his head.</p><br><p>'Shit... I completely forgot that before he fought like a normal person, only with enhanced physical abilities. His energy must be terrifying...' Adam pondered as he prepared for battle.</p><br><br><p>At his next step, Damien disappeared, ending up next to Adam.</p><br><p>The first thing Adam saw was a black rod aiming at him with all of Damien's power.</p><br><p>The realization of this instantly made Adam bounce to the side. With his gaze and electricity, he had enough speed and reaction for that. His needle was gripped tightly, ready to spring into action at the right moment.</p><br><br><p>Even though Adam dodged the assault, Damien didn't stop his attack. He with an excited smile brought his rod straight down on the wall, releasing all the momentum of his attack.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The entire chamber shuddered as massive stone fragments flew apart, a high cloud of dust rising, in an attempt to hide the destruction from just one strike.</p><br><br><p>"Damn... Looks like we're going to need a major overhaul after their fight..."</p><br><p>Stepping back from the wall, Damien smirked as he assessed his work.</p><br><p>A huge hole like an explosion was left in the wall, a layer of dust covered the floor while cracks lined much of the wall.</p><br><p>Then, Adam imagined what would happen to him if Damien did hit him with that attack.</p><br>
