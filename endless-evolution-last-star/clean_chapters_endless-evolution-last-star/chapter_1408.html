            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1408: Choosing an Opponent</strong></p><br><p>The conversation about the Rule of Blood and the Dark Heart led Adam straight to the base of the Black Fang Troupe. It was a large building in the far part of Izardo, where there was quite a lot of space compared to the average ring, and especially the center, where they visited the restaurant.</p><br><p>Although Hybrids as a race were quite rare throughout the world, the Black Fang Troupe was one of the few exceptions.</p><br><p>Xander had managed to gather Hybrids like himself in one place to work together and help each other achieve their goals. Conflicts were inevitable, both within their group and with other Hybrids in Izardo or beyond.</p><br><p>Now, Adam, Xander, Helasa, and Erada sat at a large table, like a jury waiting for the candidates to take the stage.</p><br><p>Three of them were calm as they waited for the first Hybrid, while Erada had puffed-up, dissatisfied cheeks. From the moment they decided on a plan, she had said she wanted to fight Adam.</p><br><p>At first, she insisted, then she began to ask him and even beg for such an opportunity. It had been her desire ever since Adam’s fight against Beatra. That was why she had rushed to the Red Eye Arena so quickly when she heard his name.</p><br><p>But Adam refused, time and time again.</p><br><p>“Hey! Last try!” Erada exclaimed, trying to make it before a Hybrid arrived. “Why don’t you want to fight me? I’m ready to fulfill all the conditions!”</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand without even looking in her direction.</p><br><p>“This isn’t a random battle in the arena, it’s an important stage in my evolution. I don’t want to waste this opportunity on someone like you who isn’t serious. You heard it yourself, I can’t get the Dark Heart unless both fighters are fighting to their full potential.”</p><br><p>“What? What do you mean, I’m not serious?!” Erada waved her fists indignantly. “Isn’t it best to fight someone who wants to fight you in the first place?!”</p><br><br><p>His cold response stopped her.</p><br><p>“I don’t need a fan or an opportunist. I need someone who will come for the victory, for the chance to become stronger during the fight, because I basically have the same goal.”</p><br><p>Erada was about to say something when the door opened and a tall man with broad shoulders and a menacing, stern look walked in.</p><br><p>“Glad you’re here.” Xander nodded slightly as he clasped his hands together and leaned forward. “You know very well why we’ve arranged all this, don’t you?”</p><br><p>“Yes.” The man replied dryly, standing still as a statue.</p><br><p>“Great. Then we have a few questions for you. The decision will be made at the very end. Only Adam has a voice, because he is the one who will have to fight one of you.”</p><br><br><p>Thus, the selection of candidates began.</p><br><p>Compared to the Phantoms and even more so the monsters, there were relatively few Hybrids, but even in the Black Fang Troupe, there were quite a few who wanted to fight Adam.</p><br><p>As Xander said earlier, when answering Helasa’s question: Why miss such a unique opportunity?</p><br><p>One candidate after another came forward, while Xander and Helasa asked most of the questions. They required the candidates to demonstrate their auras, talk about their battles, and explain why they wanted to fight Adam.</p><br><p>Sure, it wasn’t what an ordinary person would imagine when thinking about a battle between monsters and Phantoms, but in their situation, it was actually a pretty effective method.</p><br><p>One candidate after another came and waited in the hallway for their decision.</p><br><p>The entire selection process took quite a long time; they spent an hour talking to each candidate for at least a few minutes and testing their strength. Naturally, the final decision was left to Adam.</p><br><p>He was better than anyone else at sensing whether his opponents were his equals. He understood this not only from their auras, but also from their gaze and the way they talked about their past battles.</p><br><p>Naturally, after each candidate, Erada tried to take their place and fight Adam instead of them, but she inevitably faced rejection.</p><br><p>“So, do you have any thoughts?” Xander turned to Adam.</p><br><p>Instead of answering, Adam got up and headed for the exit.</p><br><br><p>The door opened as all the candidates’ attention turned to Adam. His gaze swept over them as he stopped at a girl with short crimson hair and gray eyes. She just stared at the spot on the wall, waiting for a decision.</p><br><p>“You.” Adam pointed at the girl. “Your name is Anelez, right?”</p><br><p>“Agh?” The girl flinched as she turned around. “Yes. That’s me. Did you want something?”</p><br><p>Adam nodded. “Yeah, you can consider this an extra round. Come with us for a moment.”</p><br><p>The other candidates exchanged glances. They realized that Anelez had become the favorite, but it wasn’t a final decision yet, which left them a chance.</p><br><p>Soon, Anelez was standing in front of them again, waiting for one of them to say something.</p><br><p>Something about Anelez interested Adam.</p><br><p>Her aura was on par with the other monsters, yet she didn’t seem as confident as the rest. But what really caught Adam’s eye was how she answered questions.</p><br><p>“Anelez, when you were here, we asked you quite a few questions. But I’d like you to answer one more.” Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>She nodded. “Sure, I’m ready.”</p><br><p>“Past battles are very important to me. I believe they are a significant part of my path as a fighter. So, think back to your most difficult battle and answer me: Would you go through that battle again?”</p><br><p>Anelez didn’t rush. She bit her lip as she recalled those important moments that had left an indelible mark on her soul.</p><br><p>Then, she straightened up and said confidently:</p><br><br><br><p>“I’m too scared. I’m afraid I would lose. I believe that I won by a miracle that day.”</p><br><p>Erada frowned, thinking it was a terrible answer, but Adam wasn’t disappointed as his eyes sparkled.</p><br><p>“What about you?” Anelez stared at Adam. “Would you want to go through your most difficult battle again?”</p><br><p>Xander and Helasa exchanged glances. They wanted to know the answer.</p><br><br><p>“Hah, let me think… That’s a good one.”</p>
