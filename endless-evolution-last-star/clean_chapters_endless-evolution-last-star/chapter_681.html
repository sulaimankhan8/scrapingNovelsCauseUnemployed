            <br><p>It didn't take Adam more than a few seconds to see the three-pointed rune in action as a new one - the five-pointed rune - floated before his eyes.</p><br><p>Unlike the previous two, the five-pointed rune was geometrically correct. All its corners are pointed inward, forming a shape reminiscent of a standard shield or pentagon.</p><br><p>The Shadow Walkers and the Dark Watcher weren't going anywhere, they were ready to fight against Adam, now that made sense.</p><br><p>In a way, the streams of flame were the judges of whose power it was to turn any part of the fortress into a battlefield. Sure, the Shadow Walkers didn't attack the Dark Watcher, but not because they were on the same side but because they had no chance of winning.</p><br><p>If there were other Dark Watchers here, there would be at least an argument between them and more likely a fierce fight, then the Shadow Walkers would take advantage of the situation and like vultures would finish off the wounded Dark Watchers.</p><br><p>Indeed, there was almost no difference, since if humans were in that situation, the same thing would happen.</p><br><p>"Hey guys, are you sure about your decision? After all, I have a gun now, too!" Adam exclaimed excitedly before reaching out his hand towards the flames.</p><br><p>He was already experienced at this, so with a purple flash a five-pointed rune appeared on his hand, Adam activated it instantly.</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that activating the rune took a certain amount of energy, but it was much less than using the First Order.</p><br><p>According to Adam's senses, he could activate five to seven different runes before expending the energy equivalent to the First Order.</p><br><br><p>Energy burst rushed from Adam's hand, transforming into a pentagonal shield floating in front of him. No additional features were noticed, it was simply a dense barrier over which Adam had complete control.</p><br><p>"What...? Damn, I should have known something like that would happen, but his arrow was impressive!" Adam muttered frustratedly, throwing a glare at the Dark Watcher.</p><br><p>Light trickles of smoke emanated from the monster's arm, it seemed that using a three-pointed rune was a hard task for a decent, devastating result.</p><br><br><p>The Shadow Walkers opened their mouths wide, pouncing on Adam with their arms raised to attack.</p><br><p>Before the monsters could get too close too quickly, Silvana's voice rang out:</p><br><p>'Are you going to try to defend yourself using that shield? I don't know how long its energy will last, but given the power of the three-pointed rune, it should be able to take a lot of hits before it breaks.'</p><br><p>However, Adam had another idea, it was obvious by his mad grin.</p><br><p>"Hah, you're right, that shield looks strong, so do the walls but their bodies..."</p><br><p>His eyes traveled to the multitude of the Shadow Walkers running towards him like wild hounds.</p><br><br><br><p>Not intending to wait any longer, Adam stepped forward, single-handedly facing more than a dozen monsters. The Shadow Walkers didn't expect this from Phantom, for a moment they were in a daze but quickly continued their assault.</p><br><br><p>The massive shield slammed right into the Shadow Walker's chest, knocking it back a meter, yet Adam didn't stop there.</p><br><p>Like a rhinoceros he thrust his way forward, holding the shield in front of him. The Shadow Walker tried to break the shield, or at least scratch it, but it was to no avail.</p><br><br><p>Adam crashed into the next Shadow Walker, then another and another until his shield was dragging eight monsters along the ground at once.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, let's see if you can take it!"</p><br><p>With a bright flame in his gaze, Adam tilted his torso forward and accelerated sharply crashing straight into the wall.</p><br><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.</p><br><p>A loud, distinct crunch echoed, not from the cracked wall, but from the breaking bones of the monsters. Flesh ripped, and streams of dark blood poured out of the rips, flooding the energy shield.</p><br><p>Bright pain reflected on the Shadow Walkers' faces, their empty eyes were in agony and their mouths wide open, yet the pressure only intensified.</p><br><p>"Oh, just a little more." Adam whispered taking a wide step forward almost a meter long.</p><br><p>This was a critical load that the flesh and blood creatures could not withstand.</p><br><br><p>With a loud crack, in the blink of an eye, the eight bodies reached their limit exploding in bloody shards. Pieces of flesh mixed with clots of blood flew off to the sides and the rest... nearly ten monsters remained sealed into the wall like a bloody stain.</p><br><p>It was as if someone grabbed a huge hammer the size of a house and smashed into the Shadow Walkers with the force of a giant.</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, as deep down her throat came gagging from the scene before her. Sure, Silvana as Operator had seen the deaths of Phantoms and monsters many times, through videos and Adam's NEP, but... this was the first time she'd had such an experience.</p><br><p>She had exactly Adam's POV, she saw what he did, the only thing different was perception and reaction speed.</p><br><p>Though they were monsters, Silvana wasn't a mad sadist who would enjoy such a bloody spectacle, legs and arms with pieces of skin slowly sliding down the walls leaving a crimson trail.</p><br><p>Finally, unable to bear the sight any longer for fear of vomiting, Silvana turned away holding her mouth with the palm of her hand.</p><br><p>"Alright! This rune isn't so useless!" Adam's smile grew wider as he clenched his fist tightly.</p><br><p>At the same moment, several shadows appeared behind him - the remaining Shadow Walkers.</p><br><br><p>Your next chapter is on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Adam turned sharply, swinging his shield like a blade, slicing off their heads in one smooth motion.</p><br><p>Before he could turn around, their decapitated bodies were already at his feet.</p><br><br><p>A lone crack went down the shield, but it was far from breaking.</p><br><p>"So, now you're the only one left, right?"</p><br><p>His gaze traveled to the distant Dark Watcher, who aimed his spear straight at Adam. The flame was about to burst out through the sharp tip, unleashing a powerful torrent of fire on Adam.</p><br><br><p>The rapidly spinning shield slammed into the Dark Watcher's neck, plunging deep into its throat.</p><br><p>"Oh." Adam's eyes went wide for a moment, "It worked. A shield is a pretty multifunctional weapon, isn't it?"</p><br><br><p>The Dark Watcher collapsed to the ground with a thud.</p>
