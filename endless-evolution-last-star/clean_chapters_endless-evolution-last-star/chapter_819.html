            <br><p>One by one, the Phantoms climbed aboard the fighters. Some wanted to take their dead comrades with them, but the military stopped them.</p><br><p>In a while, the massive BH-01 fighters would arrive for that purpose. Now, the most important thing was to get home.</p><br><p>Adam and Katrin were one of the last to arrive, they headed towards the middle fighter.</p><br><p>Suddenly, a pair of unusual purple eyes appeared behind him, someone tentatively touched his shoulder.</p><br><p>Not feeling threatened, Adam turned around meeting Gnash's timid gaze.</p><br><br><p>He raised an eyebrow in a confusion.</p><br><p>"Do you need something?"</p><br><p>"Yeah... One thing..."</p><br><p>Gnash's cheeks flushed as she looked down.</p><br><p>"Can I fly in the same fighter with you? I've seen a lot of your battles... I'm very impressed with your accomplishments..."</p><br><p>A strange feeling filled Adam. For some reason, it seemed to him that Gnash wanted to say something else, yet he had no reason to deny fellow Phantom.</p><br><br><p>With a nonchalant reply, Adam stepped forward. Gnash rushed towards him, not wanting to be left behind.</p><br><p>Katrin stayed behind, her eyes running from the calm Adam to the worried Gnash. Soon, her pupils dilated.</p><br><p>'What, seriously...? Hey! When am I going to get fans too? It's not fair!'</p><br><p>Feeling free, Adam glanced at Gnash, seemingly not noticing her shyness.</p><br><p>"Have you watched my fights? I know I'm pretty popular with Phantoms of my rank, but that only started at K1-Level."</p><br><p>In response, Gnash gave a few quick nods.</p><br><p>"Yes, yes, to be honest, I didn't start following your achievements because I found out about you as a Phantom in the first place..."</p><br><br><p>"Scarlet Light Fair..." she muttered mentioning a long ago event, "A friend of mine, a normal human was there and... She couldn't calm down for a week talking about the Phantom killing a man on a whim."</p><br><p>Adam stopped, a slight shiver went through his body. He didn't regret what he'd done, because that man had gone too far, this was revenge for Trici.</p><br><p>However, Adam fully realized that his reputation as a Phantom had hit rock bottom then. Not that it bothered him much, but when one was at the top or the bottom, it got attention from the outside.</p><br><p>Soon, Adam's gaze became more serious.</p><br><p>"And... What do you think about that? The first thing you find out about me is that I killed a mere human. That's not a good first impression."</p><br><p>"Yes, you should hear what my friend was saying, it seemed to me that it wasn't a Phantom at the fair but a monster, so... from that moment on I've been watching you closely."</p><br><p>They approached the fighter while Gnash continued:</p><br><p>"You got out of prison early, much earlier, then went on one mission, then another, and beyond that. Your missions were rare but meaningful, so I didn't miss a single one."</p><br><p>Then, her gaze darkened as if she felt guilty.</p><br><p>"I'm ashamed to admit, but because I thought you were a bad person, I wished you to fail. My friend would irritably text me every time you came out the winner once again."</p><br><br><p>She rubbed herself uncertainly on the shoulder.</p><br><p>"Soon my friend lost interest in you, stopped tracking you, but not me. Gradually I figured out the situation at the fair, your victories became memorable, I waited every time you went on a mission again, and... today we found ourselves on the battlefield together."</p><br><p>For a brief period, Adam's aura intensified. His eyes grew deeper as he glanced around at all the Phantoms that had yet to board the fighters.</p><br><p>"I see... So you're one of the squad leaders."</p><br><p>After a few seconds, he continued:</p><br><p>"So, after everything you know. What do you think of me?"</p><br><p>His question caught Gnash off guard. She flinched, rushing to answer:</p><br><p>"Like I said I'm glad I got a chance to work with you and hopefully there will be another opportunity in the future. Your fights, I'm always left very impressed after watching them."</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, Gnash put her palm to her chest.</p><br><p>"You're like a monster-phantom, the stronger your opponent, the longer and greater the fight, the more it seems that only a Phantom like you could win in that situation. I think the majority of Phantoms would fail if they were in your place in those battles."</p><br><p>Adam glanced to the side as he shrugged.</p><br><p>"Well, most monsters are wild and ferocious, bloodthirsty and vicious creatures, but they're not as dangerous as the stronger ones, calm and majestic."</p><br><br><p>With a calm gait, he approached the fighter.</p><br><p>"We may meet on the battlefield again, but... I don't know when my next mission will be. So far, I've done everything I needed to in the Dead Lands."</p><br><p>That was enough for Gnash, her eyes sparkled and she hurried to catch up with him, for now she didn't dare to ask for more.</p><br><p>By now, most of the Phantoms already climbed into their fighters, the pilots were ready to take off at any moment, they just needed an order.</p><br><p>The commander stood at the ramp, calling out to Adam:</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter, I need to speak to you as mission leader."</p><br><p>His voice was firm but full of respect for one of the most outstanding K2-Phantoms.</p><br><p>"There are a few matters that need to be discussed."</p><br><p>Adam turned toward the military man, a slight smile forming on his face.</p><br><p>"Hah, I don't mind, but I'm not the leader, the one you're looking for is standing behind me."</p><br><p>He pointed at Katrin, she was walking behind everyone, her gait was limp, but she was in no hurry, as if not wanting to leave the memorable place.</p><br><p>Before the commander could say anything, Adam disappeared inside the fighter, leaning against the wall. Gnash glanced around and took a spot next to him.</p><br><p>Then, Katrin reached the commander, he tore towards her going to help her to the ramp.</p><br><br><p>Katrin waved her hand irritably, the commander stopped one step away from her.</p><br><p>"I'm not so weak to not be able to walk. After all, we won."</p><br><p>The commander nodded deeply, the first fighters already rising above the ground.</p><br><p>"That is good Ms. Katrin. It was an important victory for you, wasn't it?"</p><br><br><p>"Perhaps, years from now, you will remember this day as the beginning of your journey. You were able to surpass yourself by defeating yourself."</p>
