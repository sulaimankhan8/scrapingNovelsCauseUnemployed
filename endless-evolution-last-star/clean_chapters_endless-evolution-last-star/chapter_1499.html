            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1499: New Lands (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>For a while, Adam and Alexia stared at the frost ridge. They couldn’t see more than what was open to their view, but that was more than enough for them to understand that this was their goal.</p><br><p>None of them knew what threats awaited them there. However, it was clear that if they wanted to fulfill the conditions for the Third Grand Star, they had to go there.</p><br><p>After all the Winding Fragments, it was the only one that immediately made their energy tremble and attracted their attention.</p><br><p>They tried to check if it was a coincidence or not, but none of the hundred fragments caused the same reaction in them.</p><br><p>“Hey… I’m ready to rush into battle right now and all that, but…” Alexia muttered, she was lost. “What should we do now? I mean, I doubt that Louis, Silvana, or anyone else will be able to point us to this place just because there are mountains, snow, and a huge spine here.”</p><br><p>Adam didn’t answer as he remembered what Beth had said and what Damien had done.</p><br><p>“That should definitely help us. Still, you’re right. We won’t get much from having one picture. Well, I have one solution.”</p><br><p>Alexia raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>“Hmm? You have an idea? Then speak and—!</p><br><p>Before she could finish, Adam pushed her forward, sending her from the edge of darkness into the frozen lands.</p><br><p>Alexia’s eyes widened in shock as she spun around, only to see that Adam had done the same. He jumped into the portal after her with a satisfied smirk.</p><br><p>Alexia didn’t have time to be angry as the familiar frost enveloped her. The same thing happened to Adam.</p><br><p>It seemed that the distant frost territory had noticed their presence, inviting them to become part of these lands or at least visit this area.</p><br><p>But neither Adam nor Alexia was destined to reach the surface.</p><br><p>“Argh?” Alexia’s face froze as she saw something strange.</p><br><p>Cracks ran across the ice lands, covering everything from the thick layer of snow to the mountains, the abyss, and the bright blue sky, which had not a single cloud, only a cold wind blowing from all sides.</p><br><p>In the next moment, the frost ridge shattered into myriad fragments, like glass shards, and they soared amid the darkness.</p><br><p>Adam and Alexia exchanged glances as they noticed that the fragments contained images of this territory from different angles and even beyond it. Now, they had the opportunity to get a glimpse of what was previously beyond their sight.</p><br><p>They did not have time to immerse themselves in the unknown darkness because the myriad fragments headed towards them, piercing and filling their minds like falling stars.</p><br><p>From the vast amount of information, Adan and Alexia’s eyes shone brightly, and then, they plunged into darkness.</p><br><br><p>The next moment, they opened their eyes, and they were in a strange space surrounded by portals.</p><br><p>Now, they could clearly see Queen Elisa above them, her pale cyan aura surrounding her, as well as Damien, Beth, Silvana, and Louis, who were still standing outside the queen’s tree.</p><br><p>“That’s it?” Adam asked, holding his head. He had seen so many different frames, as if he had been diligently memorizing maps of the area for several days.</p><br><p>Alexia was in the same state. Her head didn’t hurt, it was a different feeling, but for a while, it became difficult for her to think about anything other than the fragments that filled her mind.</p><br><p>“Tsk, so that’s why it’s the Winding Fragments, right? But… Do you know what this place is? Even though we can see everything as if looking directly at a map, I can’t figure out where the hell it is.”</p><br><p>In response, Adam nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“Yeah… It’s not like the Dead Lands or Tarnished Lands. Maybe it’s some deep part of the Dark Shore, but still, something’s not right here. The Dark Shore is grim and scary, but this place looks like a challenge to a fight, like a desire to find out who is stronger, not who has more influence.”</p><br><p>Sure, the Dark Shore was the most dangerous region, but Adam doubted that there were lands in this world where monsters more powerful than those at the Dark Shore lived. He couldn’t imagine there being an equivalent to the Befallen Crown or Free End anywhere else. The only exception was the Renegades at the Tarnished Lands.</p><br><p>“Well, now that we’ve done everything, we should get out of here. I don’t want to stay here any longer. This whole time-slowing thing makes me sick.”</p><br><p>Adam took a deep breath, trying to come to terms with everything that had happened.</p><br><p>Together, they stepped out of Queen Elisa’s aura. A gray-blue energy wave ran through their bodies as they stepped off the platform and returned to their familiar world, where time flowed as it should.</p><br><p>Damien, who was looking at his watch, looked up and grinned.</p><br><p>“Here we go. You did it pretty quickly. It’s only been a few hours. I take it you found the fragment you needed, right?”</p><br><p>Adam and Alexia nodded.</p><br><p>“Yes, but we don’t understand where the place we need is. Something similar happened to me before. The energy showed me the path, and Silvana found the place based on my description. But… after my journey to the Tarnished Lands, I realized that this method no longer works.”</p><br><p>Damien shrugged. He knew what Adam was talking about.</p><br><p>“The further away from the Citadel, the more unknown and new places there are. There aren’t enough powerful Phantoms to have complete information about every small area. Moreover, every few decades, everything changes naturally, and with the World Wipe, there is a complete reset.”</p><br><br><p>“But that’s not a problem. You can find your own way to this territory. Still, I’d like to hear a brief description. You know,” Damien pointed to Beth. “She knows a lot, maybe too much.”</p><br><p>Beth rolled her eyes as she stared at Adam and Alexia.</p><br><p>“Come on, tell us what you saw.”</p><br><p>They didn’t waste any time and explained everything.</p><br><p>A few minutes later, Damien chuckled as he arrogantly lifted his chin.</p><br><p>“Looks like it’s time to head to the new lands, right? Huh, you’ve become so strong so quickly. That’s good, very good.”</p>
