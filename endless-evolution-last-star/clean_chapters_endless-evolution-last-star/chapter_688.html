            <br><br><p>Moving in the wake of the flame thread, Adam descended lower and lower, passing by dozens of monsters waiting for the next time the runes appeared to absorb energy and become stronger.</p><br><p>The Fortress of the Lone Serpent was a complex multi-layered structure, and there were several floors in addition to countless passageways, rooms, and squares.</p><br><p>After going down two floors, Adam didn't notice anything strange except for a few changes that were unpleasant to him:</p><br><p>"Khm... The passageways are much narrower, there are almost no windows, and there are fewer and fewer torches... If this continues, I'll have to wander in darkness."</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam decided to take the help of technology, he pointed his right hand forward, activating the flashlight on his NEP.</p><br><p>Yet, although the flashlight turned on and worked properly, the dark passageway didn't get any brighter, as if there was an invisible fog wandering around absorbing the foreign light.</p><br><p>"I see... If it was able to block my Gene Field, it would definitely have no problem against ordinary electric light."</p><br><p>His footsteps echoed off the bare stone walls, the cold wind whipping through the sharp turns only picking up speed, rippling the dim flames of the sparse torches.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, as soon as Adam descended into one of the lower levels of what looked more like a maze with no doors, windows, or stairs, he stopped encountering monsters.</p><br><p>Though, even if it did, they'd have to think about how to get through, since only one human-sized creature could fit in such a narrow passageway.</p><br><p>"Damn, if there were guards at the entrance here, they'd have to go sideways if they wanted to get to me. I'm sure these walls are as solid as anything in this fucking place."</p><br><p>There was no panic in his heart, as for now, all he had to do was follow the flaming thread.</p><br><p>In an instant, Adam's eyes went wide when he hesitantly stopped, staring at the wall in the middle of the fork. He could go either left or right, there were long passageways leading there, plunging into darkness, but...</p><br><p>Adam glanced down to make sure he wasn't imagining it - a flaming thread was leading him right into that wall. He turned around to make sure the thread was intact, he hoped it wasn't, but, the thread hadn't broken or split anywhere.</p><br><p>"What the hell...? Is this fortress messing with me or what!" Adam angrily exclaimed clenching his fists tightly.</p><br><p>Then, Silvana's calm voice echoed in his mind:</p><br><p>'Adam, there are several possibilities here. It could be a trap, though I'm not sure how, or it could be done on purpose.'</p><br><p>"Agh? What do you mean by saying it's done on purpose?" Adam was confused.</p><br><p>'I mean, you had to defeat a strong opponent to get the magma ring and flame thread as your guide, right?'</p><br><p>Adam nodded uncertainly, he still didn't understand Silvana's train of thought.</p><br><p>'In that case, if you or another Phantom were to choose to take the runes rather than fight against the Solitary Commander, then you shouldn't be able to find the path the flame thread leads.'</p><br><br><p>'There's a chance that without the magma ring, you would go down, into this maze and choose the right path, but... given how sturdy the buildings and all the objects in Wild Lands are, I doubt you'd hit a random wall wanting to break it for no valid reason.'</p><br><p>After that, Adam's eyes went wide in realization. He realized Silvana and it brought a happy smile to his face.</p><br><p>"I see!" Adam slapped his fist on his palm with a shining look.</p><br><p>He blinked a few times with empty eyes as if he realized something.</p><br><br><p>Adam glared at the flaming thread.</p><br><p>"W-wait... Besides this thread, I have another way to figure out where to go."</p><br><p>Without delay, black particles appeared around him, active ripples went forward, disappearing behind the wall in an unknown direction.</p><br><p>"Alright, looks like I have no choice but to strike with all my might!" Adam smiled broadly before bringing his fist out to attack.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, his expression changed from cheerful to cold, a sharp glint ran through his eyes - Adam was going to strike at full force, realizing how durable the wall had to be.</p><br><p>'Fine, even if it takes a few more punches I'll do them, but... This isn't a gate, so I should manage in one punch!'</p><br><p>Stepping forward and flexing his torso, Adam slammed with all his might into the wall, skin stretched over bone and knuckles sliced through the wind currents like blades.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a smooth line ran down the wall as dozens of sharp teeth reflected in Adam's focused eyes.</p><br><p>The massive jaw the size of a man opened wide, about to swallow Adam as its next victim.</p><br><p>Before Adam could do anything or realize what was happening, a long tongue covered in sharp spikes like a snake tied itself around his arm, forcefully pulling him inside right into the jaws.</p><br><br><p>Silvana's scream of panic raced through his mind, she saw everything through his eyes: how the powerful jaws were closing fast, the sharp teeth sought to sink into Adam's flesh and the long tongue prevented him from escaping.</p><br><br><p>At the very last moment, Adam's left hand stopped the upper jaw and his right foot crashed down on the lower one.</p><br><p>Like the jaws of the wall, Adam's muscles shook from time to time, but he was strong enough and most importantly angry to fight back.</p><br><p>"Bastard... Decided you can eat me just because I need to pass on? I don't know who or what you are, but... I'm not going to let you eat me like a piece of meat..."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes narrowed, becoming as cold as ancient glaciers, not tolerating compromise or unnecessary talk - wanting only pure violence.</p><br><p>"Because I'll do it myself."</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam leaped forward, jaws closing behind him with a loud snap, right at his back as the darkness engulfed him.</p><br><p>Yet, a few seconds later, painful screams erupted from the lower level of the fortress, but it was nothing like the way humans screamed.
