            <br><br><p>Adam opened the door, saying farewell to his hotel room where he stayed for only one day, but this place allowed him to feel himself in the place of an ordinary human who achieved everything he dreamed of while living in the slums.</p><br><p>If a person was not related to Dead Lands, then to be in the First Ring, in this hotel, was possible only thanks to a high level of skill in some field or owning his business.</p><br><p>Simply put, it required a lot of money that people from other parts of the Citadel did not possess.</p><br><br><p>Walking through the lobby, heading for the tall glass doors, Adam was finishing the soda he took from his minibar.</p><br><p>He was in his usual clothes now, blue unbuttoned shirt, white t-shirt, and beige pants. If he were to walk around in the outfit Franz and Rosalind had prepared for him, showing the emblem of the Balo Family, it would draw a lot of unnecessary attention to him.</p><br><p>Taking the last few sips, Adam ran his gaze around the corners of the hall, looking for an urn.</p><br><p>His eyes locked on one urn that was quite far away from him, but he didn't need to get close to get rid of the soda.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>With a slight motion of his hand, Adam tossed the soda can directly into the trash can, flying next to some of the guests.</p><br><br><p>The soda can flew into the lid of the urn at high speed, causing it to spin rapidly from the collision, the urn shook, spreading a rumble around.</p><br><p>A lot of people turned in his direction, some had wide-open eyes as they realized that Adam was the Phantom since he was able to do this.</p><br><p>"Oh, I guess that wasn't the best decision." Adam scratched the back of his head, he didn't need those stares.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, no one started to approach Adam, since unlike the Third Ring, no one recognized him.</p><br><p>Almost all the people in this hotel were in their middle years, in expensive suits, and a lot of business awaited them this afternoon. They only knew what the most famous Phantoms looked like, so it was no surprise.</p><br><br><p>Adam tapped his NEP, only to be answered a minute later by Silvana. It was quick, but it was unusually long for Silvana, especially on such an important day.</p><br><p>'Hi! I'm sorry I didn't answer right away. Something happened that I wasn't prepared for... but it won't affect our mission in any way! Your car should be arriving at the hotel entrance within three minutes!'</p><br><p>"Good." Adam nodded deeply, heading towards the hotel exit.</p><br><p>Some rustling noises were coming from Silvana as if she was changing clothes or unpacking something, but Adam didn't pay much attention to it.</p><br><p>Then, she turned off and Adam walked through the main doors under the watchful gaze of two guards.</p><br><p>Just as Silvana had said, a black car soon appeared outside the hotel, but it wasn't the government vehicle they usually used as Phantom and Operator, it was a regular cab operating throughout the Citadel, especially in the First Ring with a record number of roads and offices.</p><br><p>Adam looked at the license plates, nodded, and opened the door getting into the back seat.</p><br><br><p>A clear, sly voice came from the front seat.</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"Yeah, I hope it stays good till the end."</p><br><p>The driver nodded, he had a pointed hat, short black hair, blue eyes, and square-lensed glasses.</p><br><p>Adam paid attention to the driver's clothes, they looked too expensive and stylish, it wasn't even about the price but how well the details matched each other, showing that he had a taste and a lot of experience in this matter.</p><br><p>"Hah, Antonio, I'm sorry but I can't help but praise your outfit, it looks impressive." Adam said sincerely. He knew the driver's name since it was written in the app.</p><br><p>He was surprised that an ordinary man, with a regular job could dress so well. Adam wasn't sure that Rosalind and Franz, together, could do something like that for another cab driver.</p><br><p>"Oh, you said Antonio? I'm sorry, but Antonio got sick at the last minute and was unable to fulfill your order, even though he already took it. So, to avoid causing problems, he asked me to replace him." The driver said with a slight smile on his face, placing one hand on the steering wheel.</p><br><p>Adam blinked a few times baffled.

Adam inwardly shrugged, deciding not to think about it too much. He had far more important things to do today.</p><br><p>"What's your name then?" Adam asked, feeling awkward about getting his name wrong.</p><br><p>"I hope you remember my name, I don't know about the others, but I'm proud of it."</p><br><p>Then, the driver turned around and held out his hand to Adam.</p><br><p>"My name is Gladius, nice to meet you, Adam Vinter."</p><br><p>Adam frowned. He didn't understand how the cab driver could know his name.</p><br><p>'Did he just see the video of me? No...' Adam glanced at Gladius, 'Judging by his sly smile he knows me for another reason, but what exactly is it?'</p><br><p>Gladius didn't wait long and shook Adam's hand himself.</p><br><p>Adam flinched slightly, Gladius's grip was unusually strong for a mere human.</p><br><p>"I understand your confusion, but it's much simpler than you think." Gladius uttered and reached into the front seat, revealing a large black box.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes grew wider for a moment as the realization came to him.</p><br><p>"As you've figured out already, neatly folded here is your outfit along with an Eight Blades cape. We spoke with Franz and Rosalind and decided it would be best for you to keep your time."</p><br><p>Gladius shrugged nonchalantly, turned around, and placed two hands on the steering wheel, prematurely buckling up, doing everything by the book.</p><br><br><p>Adam nodded deeply before looking intently at Gladius.</p><br><p>"You work for Franz?"</p><br><p>Gladius's corners of his mouth curved and his eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>"No, I wouldn't say that, but we have one case in common right now."</p><br><p>Then, Gladius fixed his rearview mirror and put his foot on the gas pedal.</p><br><p>"Well, let's not waste any more time. I've got another profession change to make in this day and..." A gleam passed across Gladius's eyes, "I'm not the only one."</p>
