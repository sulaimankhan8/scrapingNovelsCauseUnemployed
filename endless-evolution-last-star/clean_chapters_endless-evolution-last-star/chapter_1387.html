            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1387: Cold Cider</strong></p><br><p>The Black Cut was the strongest but smallest faction of the three at the Forgotten Mills. The Gray Needle and White Thread had far more members in their ranks.</p><br><p>Still, each faction had existed for hundreds of years, and even the Black Cut had managed to gather quite a few members, as Adam would soon discover.</p><br><br><p>Following Misty, he climbed the hill as the field in front of Norax’s mill opened up before them. Usually, it was empty, but now there were many tables, candles burning, and dozens of monsters doing everything in their power to set up a feast as quickly as possible.</p><br><p>Although this didn’t usually happen, there was a reason for it today, and Norax himself was overseeing the entire process.</p><br><p>How could anyone refuse him?</p><br><p>“Faster, faster! You’re moving like snails, damn it!” Norax waved his hand irritably.</p><br><p>Narica, as an experienced person in such matters, did most of the work.</p><br><p>However, it was impossible to get everything done in just ten minutes, even for a group of Elder Level monsters.</p><br><p>Adam stopped, watching the amazing and even somewhat comical scene.</p><br><p>“Hah, is all this for me?”</p><br><br><p>“Of course. I think you’re impressed, but you shouldn’t be. You got your reward on the island, but all these monsters, or at least most of them, will soon become much stronger, and it’s all thanks to you.”</p><br><p>Adam smiled awkwardly as he understood the irony of the situation.</p><br><p>“You know I’m a human, right? You’re saying this to cheer me up, but isn’t it a big problem that I helped so many monsters become stronger?”</p><br><p>“On the one hand, yes, but I think you’ve become strong enough to understand that monsters and humans aren’t always enemies. Moreover, don’t forget that the head of the Black Cut literally plays video games using a console and gamepad.</p><br><p>“Sometimes things seem complicated, but in reality, everything can be quite simple. At a low level, any monster or Phantom is a deadly enemy, but now? We monsters are throwing a feast in your honor, and everyone is happy about it.”</p><br><p>Misty moved on as Adam followed her, remembering that this wasn’t actually the first time this had happened.</p><br><p>At Fallen Ring Castle, when he helped the serpents and defeated Arnoth, the situation was similar, just a few levels lower than it is now.</p><br><p>The first to notice Adam’s arrival with Misty was Karso.</p><br><p>“Hey! You’re finally back!”</p><br><p>Before Adam could even realize it, Karso appeared next to him, throwing his arm around his shoulder.</p><br><p>“Here, try it!” Karso exclaimed, handing Adam a bottle that reminded him of a popular drink in the Citadel.</p><br><p>“Is this… beer?” Adam raised an eyebrow, puzzled.</p><br><p>Karso waved his hand with a slight doubt in his voice.</p><br><p>“Well, it’s much lighter and sweeter. I know what beer is, but I think this is closer to cider. Just don’t drink too much, it’s made from grains and berries from neighboring territories. So, it’s strong stuff, you know?”</p><br><p>Adam wasn’t a big fan of alcohol, but he didn’t have anything against it either. All he wanted was for the drink to be tasty.</p><br><p>“Let’s see what you brought me.”</p><br><br><p>Adam took a sip as his eyes widened.</p><br><p>Surprisingly, the cider was so cold that his tongue went numb at first, but then, the high alcohol content with rich berries exploded in his mouth like a flavor bomb.</p><br><p>“Hahaha!” Karso laughed. “Judging by the look on your face, you liked it!”</p><br><p>Adam nodded slowly as he stared at the bottle.</p><br><p>“Yeah, it’s pretty good. But why is it so cold? It felt like I was drinking a glacier, not cider.”</p><br><p>In response, Karso tapped the bottom of the bottle.</p><br><p>“Frost crystal. Maybe we monsters don’t have the same high technology as the humans in the Citadel, but with the energy and resources available in these lands, you can do quite a few interesting things.”</p><br><br><p>Misty poked Karso in the side with her umbrella, making him yelp.</p><br><p>“Ouch! What do you want from me?”</p><br><p>Misty turned around, heading toward the mill.</p><br><p>“Follow me, I have to make desserts. I’m sure Adam will figure out what to do without you.”</p><br><p>Karso rolled his eyes.</p><br><p>“Alright, alright. Couldn’t you just ask me nicely?” He shoved his hands in his pockets and followed her. After all, even a monster as strong as he was couldn’t resist Misty’s desserts. It was beyond his power.</p><br><p>Adam shrugged and moved on.</p><br><p>‘When a feast is held in your honor, you don’t have to do anything—that’s probably the main advantage, right?’ He thought, sipping cider from time to time. ‘Damn, this stuff is good. I’ll have to try to find something similar in the Citadel.’</p><br><p>Suddenly, there was an exclamation from the side.</p><br><br><p>“Hm?” He turned around and met Nollura’s gaze.</p><br><p>He was surprised to see how much she had changed, but he knew it had to be that way because Norax had to make her stronger so she could be a full member of the Black Cut.</p><br><p>“You’re back! You actually passed all the trials, right?”</p><br><p>Adam glanced at her, took another sip, and nodded.</p><br><p>“Yeah, it turned out to be harder than I thought. By the way, since you’re here, is Ureyn here too?”</p><br><p>In response, Nollura shook her head.</p><br><p>“As you know, he took his defeat by you quite hard. A few months ago, after he woke up, he went to neighboring territories to fight and become stronger.”</p><br><p>She awkwardly looked away.</p><br><p>“In fact, I’m sure he thinks you’re still training to rebuild the Energy Axis. You completed that task much faster than anyone expected.”</p><br><p>Adam smiled. “Well, it took me over a month. I’m sure that’s fast for you, but for me, it was the longest training ever. I gave it my all.”</p><br><p>Then, he looked away.</p><br><p>“It’s a shame Ureyn won’t be visiting us. After all, I’m going to leave these lands after the feast.”</p><br><p>Nollura’s eyes widened as she nodded.</p><br><p>“Yes, sure. I hope your journey continues to be as successful.”</p><br><br><p>Adam took a sip, looking at the crimson scar in the sky.</p><br>
