            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1365: Seal of the First Tragedy</strong></p><br><p>Each trial had a light source, even though they all took place inside the White Spire, which was basically enclosed by high walls that blocked out the sunlight.</p><br><p>Well, in this case, it wasn’t the walls, but Adam didn’t know that yet.</p><br><p>So, to prevent a contender from wandering in the darkness during the trials, each of them had an artificial light source that could not be influenced in any way. It was a fake sun that hovered high above, spreading its sometimes bright, sometimes dim light.</p><br><p>But the third trial was an exception. The source of light all this time was a single crystal at the very top, namely the Amber Sun Spear.</p><br><p>As soon as Adam broke the crystal, the third trial plunged into darkness, as only the many bright purple eyes of the wyverns and the intense gaze of the guard remained visible.</p><br><p>However, as soon as Adam threw the spear, light once again covered the battlefield, as all the monsters and even the Azure Wyvern froze in awe.</p><br><p>The Azure Wyvern, as the guard of this trial, was supposed to try to protect the red heart, but even it did not have enough courage to stand in the path of the blazing sun.</p><br><p>“Third trial… it will end right now.” Adam’s eyes deepened as the Amber Sun Spear reached its target.</p><br><p>Neither thick ice, chains, nor even a threatening aura could protect the red heart. Even if Adam hadn’t broken a piece of the glacier with the white spears before, one throw of this spear would still have been more than enough to end this trial in victory.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With an active tremor, a bright light tore through the red heart as the glacier and the dark fortress began to crumble into pieces.</p><br><p>The wyverns and the guard hurried away, wanting to reach the distant ice peaks to take shelter there from the shock wave.</p><br><p>Adam did the same, but his goal was the bridge, where he watched from afar as the fortress fell among the ice.</p><br><p>At that moment, he noticed something unusual.</p><br><p>“Wait…” He muttered, looking at the debris. “Why is there nothing here?”</p><br><p>At the first trial, he immediately understood that he needed to obtain the fang to open the gate. In the second trial, he obtained the orb after defeating the Crystal Golem to set the platform in motion.</p><br><p>But… What should he do now?</p><br><p>Sure, he destroyed the red heart and found the special item, but all of that was just steps to move forward.</p><br><p>“No, what’s more important?” Adam glanced at the wyverns that were rapidly losing their power. Neither they nor the Azure Wyvern were a threat to him anymore. “Where is the dark fragment? Perhaps that’s more important to me than the path ahead.”</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, one of the fragments trembled, attracting Adam’s attention.</p><br><p>Without wasting any more time, he rushed forward, throwing rocks and pieces of ice aside, all to reach the secret object.</p><br><p>“This. Is this it?” Adam stared at the crimson crystal with dark edges.</p><br><p>The crimson crystal trembled from time to time like a beating heart, but the pace quickly slowed, indicating that Adam needed to hurry.</p><br><p>“Alright, I’ll do it!”</p><br><p>He grabbed the crimson crystal as a bright light burst through his fingers like a star ready to explode.</p><br><p>But instead of exploding, all the light swirled around Adam’s hand like a restless whirlwind, quickly becoming darker and darker until only darkness remained in his fist.</p><br><p>Slowly opening his hand, Adam saw the third dark fragment in his palm.</p><br><p>His eyes widened as he hastily pulled out the other two fragments, placing the third in the empty socket.</p><br><br><p>As he had expected, the third fragment fit perfectly with the others, joining together into a single seal with some kind of image, but Adam still couldn’t see each of them clearly.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The seal trembled as purple light ran along its edges, and Adam’s eyes flashed.</p><br><p>[Seal of the First Tragedy</p><br><p>The seal that only a rejected warrior at the White Spire can obtain, one who has decided to undergo the most difficult trials and defeat the most dangerous guards. Naturally, it is this warrior and no other who should have the right to undergo the real trial that will change his fate and help him achieve his desire.]</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam’s eyes scanned the seal once more as he began to recognize the silhouette of the creature on it.</p><br><p>Rumble. Rumble. Rumble.</p><br><p>With a crash, the bridge split into blocks that quickly rushed forward, creating a staircase for Adam, leading him west, straight into the void, this time a dark one, for he had destroyed the source of light.</p><br><p>A secret passage opened at the very end of the staircase, bringing a slight smile to Adam’s face.</p><br><p>He understood what was happening here.</p><br><p>‘Mona didn’t show up, and there’s no elevator or platform that would take me up or down like before. If I’m leaving the White Spire, then it’s its will, not the Silver Beacon’s, right?’</p><br><p>With a slight nod of his head, Adam moved forward, quickly jumping from one platform to another, which were the steps of this great staircase.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>When Adam was halfway across, there was a tremor as a passage opened at the top — a bright beam of light fell.</p><br><p>Adam turned to see a woman with porcelain skin slowly descending. Her long platinum hair fell below her feet, giving her a majestic appearance to match her powerful aura.</p><br><p>As soon as Adam looked into her crystal-clear eyes, he knew who she was.</p><br><p>“Adam Vinter…” Bertrada growled in a low voice. “I don’t know how you managed to make contact with the White Spire, but if you thought you could use the rules to fool me, you’re wrong!”</p><br><br><p>Bertrada waved her hand, creating a gap in front of her that opened into a large amber eye. In a heartbeat, a devastating beam of light crashed down on Adam, seeking to reduce him to dust.</p><br><p>But… Bertrada didn’t take into account that Adam had already collected the Seal of the First Tragedy.</p><br><p>Now, she had no power here. Not over him, anyway.</p>
