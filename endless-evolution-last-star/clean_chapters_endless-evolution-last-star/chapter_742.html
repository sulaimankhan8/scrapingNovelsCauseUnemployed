            <br><br><p>Viron climbed to the top of one of the walls, it was high enough to see everything that was going on around the fortress, especially Katrin's fight against the Dormant Lord.</p><br><p>Perhaps in any other situation, the archers would have tried to attack him for getting so close to the wall, but they realized that right now they were temporary allies.</p><br><p>None of the Phantoms would want to destroy the walls and demolish the fortress, unlike the Dormant Lord who already practically did so with his last attack.</p><br><p>Soon, a shadow with a powerful aura appeared behind Viron.</p><br><p>"What, decided to observe the scene from the best seats?"</p><br><p>Gnash snorted, her gaze was slightly displeased, though... she decided to do the same as Viron, she had no other reason to climb the northern wall.</p><br><p>He didn't pay attention to her pointless sneer, instead, Viron just took a deep breath.</p><br><p>''Do you think she will win? The Dormant Lord... he looks considerably stronger than we imagined."</p><br><p>"Pffft, maybe you should think better about what to do with the fortress? So far, we've only cleared territory at the north wall and the gate, the Shadow Walkers and Dark Watchers clustered in the rest of it."</p><br><p>But, Viron answered nothing, the nonchalance hanging in the air showing that he was willing to wait for her answer as long as necessary.</p><br><p>Gnash crossed her arms over her chest, her staff at her belt, for now, she wasn't going to fight anyone.</p><br><p>"I don't know. She's got no shortage of accomplishments as a Phantom, but nothing spectacular except for defeating the Plague Reaper, but I've said what I think about that."</p><br><p>Viron nodded slightly, biting down on his thumb.</p><br><p>"So... We should prepare to fight against the Dormant Lord soon, or run away, right?"</p><br><br><p>Gnash blinked several times, her purple eyes wide open.</p><br><p>Viron continued his thought:</p><br><p>"Hey... Which one do you pick?"</p><br><p>"What do you mean?" Gnash tilted her head in confusion.</p><br><p>In response, Viron pointed first to the Grim Warro, then to the Silent Droao hovering over a hill in the distance. Unlike the Grim Warro, the drop-shaped monster was in no hurry to approach the fortress, patience was its path to victory.</p><br><p>"Which one do you want to fight? From the looks of it, besides Katrin, we are the strongest in the fortress, which means we have to take on those two. I'd rather fight that walking tree, it..."</p><br><p>For a moment, Viron's green eyes grew colder, they were filled with a cruelty that did not tolerate compromise.</p><br><p>"It will burn beneath my flames, slowly and completely, until only a handful of dark ashes remain..."</p><br><p>Gnash standing behind Viron, cast a hard stare at him, feeling a threat coming from him.</p><br><p>'Damn, he seems calm and reasonable, but it seems that's just the part he wants to show... This guy is dangerous, but isn't that what we need?'</p><br><br><p>Clearing her throat, Gnash gave a reply:</p><br><p>"Bubble, I'll take on the Essence Silent Droao, I don't think you'll benefit from fighting against a water opponent, so you can thank me for making your life easier."</p><br><p>With an emotionless face, Viron shrugged his shoulders.</p><br><br><p>Gnash wrinkled her nose, there was as much sincerity in his words as there was snow in the desert.</p><br><p>Then, she looked south, at her future adversary.</p><br><p>"When do we attack and where? Do we wait for them to approach the fortress and fight here, or do we head for the hills?"</p><br><p>Sure enough, the waves of monsters were a threat, despite their calm conversation, the Phantoms continued to fight the monsters both in front of the gate and inside the fortress. Every few seconds a dozen monsters would die and the Phantoms would receive wounds.</p><br><p>Viron slowly shook his head.</p><br><p>"Don't hurry, we'll see how Katrin does first, whether she wins or loses depends a lot and... of course, it's much better to fight inside the fortress. There's enough room here to fit several massive arenas."</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The nine-pointed star shone brightly, bombarding Katrin with a powerful aura, even if they were opponents worthy of each other, she couldn't withstand the pressure of the enemy Spirit for too long without summoning her one. Find your next adventure on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>The corners of her lips twitched, as a bitter smile covered Katrin's face.</p><br><p>"Hah, that aura... It's not the most intimidating I've encountered, the Plague Reaper is way ahead in that, but..."</p><br><p>Her black eyes rose upwards, mesmerized by the pulsating star that seemed to descend from the heavens.</p><br><p>"This is definitely the most majestic thing I've ever seen..."</p><br><p>A shiver coursed through her body in waves, as did the slight elation that she finally got the chance to fight someone so mighty.</p><br><p>She stood levelly before someone whose strength made her heart beat fast and adrenaline filled her blood.</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam's silhouette appeared in her mind.</p><br><p>"Agh... In your case, it's less common to fight against ordinary opponents than against such demons, right? Oh, soon I'll surpass you, I can feel it..."</p><br><p>With a slightly insane grin, Katrin's eyes became even darker, turning into two vortexes leading straight into the depths of the abyss.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Black erupted at her feet, running along her body before breaking out in a hungry inferno burning around her.</p><br><p>Her aura actively shook quickly taking the form of a tall creature with two long arms, broad palms, and long claws, a dark body, and a large head devoid of eyes and face.</p><br><p>Yet, once her faceless Spirit was fully formed, the fearsome demon opened its jaw wide enough for all to see the crimson flames raging in the depths of its throat.</p><br><p>The Phantoms and monsters watching the fight froze for a few seconds with pale faces. They felt that if they became the target of this ravenous demon, it would devour them -- all to satisfy its hunger.</p><br><p>The two spheres, white and black collided with each other, unable to win in a deadly battle of auras.</p><br><p>"Hah, it seems... your star isn't so bright when it meets the profound darkness, is it?"</p><br><p>Then the Dormant Lord didn't answer anything, instead slightly weakening his aura when a bright flash came out of his chest.</p><br><p>Then, the Dormant Lord's silhouette disappeared, finding itself not far from his opponent... or his next victim?</p>
