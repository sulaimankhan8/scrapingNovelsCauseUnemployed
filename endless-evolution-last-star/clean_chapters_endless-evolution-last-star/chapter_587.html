            <br><p>Joy filled Elva, Liv, and Tilda’s faces when they saw Fromund’s flaming fist reach its target.
</p><br><p>Even if Adam had partially blocked the damage by sacrificing his needle, it meant nothing.
</p><br><p>No one expected Fromund to be able to win with just one attack, not just his sister, but many viewers were sure that it would be enough to hurt Adam badly.
</p><br><p>The flames burned Adam’s right shoulder and part of his arm up to the elbow and that was only supposed to be the beginning.
</p><br><p>The fire burst in a wave headed forward, leaving a black trail on the ground and smashing into the wall. If Adam tried to dodge, the scarlet stream would engulf him, nailing him to the confines of the arena and gradually burning him.
</p><br><p>It wouldn’t be fatal, but fighting as an equal after something like that would be an impossible task. Adam’s entire body would ache like hell, distracting his mind.
</p><br><p>And, after Fromund’s attack, one of the fighters was slammed against the wall, but it wasn’t Adam, it was Fromund himself.
</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Elva’s body, her teeth grinding.
</p><br><p>"What... How? What happened? A few blue flashes and my brother was in such a vulnerable position."
</p><br><p>Sharing her concern, Liv bit down on her finger almost to the point of bleeding.
</p><br><p>"Elva... There’s something wrong with our brother. I can’t remember the last time I saw him like this. His face... he’s scared... It almost never happened even when we lived in the Lower Ring."
</p><br><p>Oddly enough, though Tilda was also worried about her older brother, she was more baffled than worried about him.
</p><br><p>"Does my brother see something I can’t?"
</p><br><p>It was like this. For Tilda as well as most of the audience above Adam there was no darkness that Fromund saw.
</p><br><br><p>Erik’s hand fell on her shoulder, gently turning her so that she was looking not at Fromund but at Adam, seeing his grimace.
</p><br><br><p>"Agh... What is it...?
</p><br><p>Darkness engulfed Tilda, filling her entire field of vision. She couldn’t even see Erik who stood less than one meter away from her.
</p><br><p>A coldness that brought calm and peace, frightening and attractive at the same time reflected in Tilda’s gray eyes.
</p><br><p>She was scared, her body didn’t want to be here anymore, but her mind saw nothing unnatural in it.
</p><br><p>Read latest stories on NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>This was a stage that could not be reached by talent or by origin - only through the realization of failure and the desire to transcend every source of inner fear.
</p><br><p>No longer fearing the darkness, Tilda’s eyes traveled towards Fromund.
</p><br><p>’It’s so weird... The fights are so much better than the movies or the TV series, and Adam as a fighter is definitely special.’
</p><br><br><p>A slight smile appeared on Tilda’s face, getting used to the darkness that was no longer cold to her.
</p><br><p>’Big brother’s the same way.’
</p><br><br><p>Filled with the power of gravity and lightning, Adam’s fist came crashing down on Fromund.
</p><br><p>Then, seeing his opponent’s approaching attack, Fromund realized one very simple thing: ’He’s not going to hurt me. He intends to kill me!’
</p><br><p>A human’s heart begins to beat faster in emergencies, whether it is joy or fear, the reasons could be many.
</p><br><p>Approaching death was clearly one of the most powerful triggers from the mind to the body to use all its resources to survive.
</p><br><p>That was the only purpose and... energy, the artifact, and other parts of the Phantom were no exception to that rule.
</p><br><p>Everything worked like a single mechanism.
</p><br><br><p>Streams of hot steam came off Fromund’s body as he tore sideways at high speed in a blur of shadow.
</p><br><p>A gravitational fist swept over his shoulder, missing only for a moment.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The tremble spread throughout the arena, traveling quickly through the spectator seats and even reaching the far parts of the Moon Colosseum.
</p><br><p>The massive structure of truly gigantic proportions felt the force of the impact of a single creature that was no bigger than an ant in comparison.
</p><br><p>Cracks like an unstoppable disaster traveled along the wall shattering it into massive debris, the ground beneath Adam suffered the same fate, turning into a broken surface as from an earthquake.
</p><br><br><br><p>"No! We have to run away!"
</p><br><p>Spectators who weren’t lucky enough to be on the near row to Adam’s impact exclaimed, their voices filled with fear.
</p><br><p>They saw the cracks coming fast, the arena wall collapsing and all they could think about was that they would be next.
</p><br><p>On the nearest row, on the center seat, there was one man, a middle-aged man who didn’t even move his finger while his neighbors tried to get out of their seats.
</p><br><p>His arms were crossed over his chest and his thick beard swayed slightly with each of his heavy breaths.
</p><br><p>He wasn’t a powerful Phantom or even a simple Phantom, he was just an ordinary man.
</p><br><p>Why was he so calm then?
</p><br><p>Well, unlike the others, this was not his first time as a spectator of the Moon Colosseum. He knew full well that he had nothing to worry about.
</p><br><p>By now, cracks passed through the thick walls aiming for the first row only to stop abruptly.
</p><br><p>A blue glint traveled down the barrier, rushing upward at lightning speed, dispelling all the residual force of Adam’s punch along the barrier.
</p><br><p>"Hah, you fucking cowards!" The man chuckled evilly in his menacing voice, "Don’t you have it in you to just sit in your seats and watch the fight? This is the Moon Colosseum, not some third-rate arena!"
</p><br><br><p>The cheese chips disappeared into Kogen’s mouth as he rolled his eyes at the man’s words.
</p><br><p>"Damn, that old man is still just like that, showing off to the intimidating newbies. Though... Considering he’s got all this to rebuild, he’s entitled to it.
</p><br><p>Then, he shrugged, glaring at Adam who slowly turned to Fromund. His eyes returned to normal and the frightening aura no longer emanated from him.
</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."
</p><br><p>Flows of burning steam were relentlessly escaping from Fromund’s body, he was breathing heavily and his heart was beating faster and harder than ever.
</p><br><p>It gave him strength, but he could only stay like this for a very limited time.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The stone hammer shuddered, drawing Fromund’s attention, his eyes darting to the hot hilt of his weapon.
</p><br><p>’Oh, yeah... I guess you’re right. I shouldn’t waste this opportunity. Looks like I’ve been tricked and this fight is going to be a lot more serious than I thought...’</p>
