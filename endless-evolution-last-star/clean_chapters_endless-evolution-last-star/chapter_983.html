            <br><br><p>Adam found himself next to Vorx and Heret, watching the battle begin through a path of vibrant crystals and a lava lake.</p><br><p>"So... Are they going to fight?" Vorx scratched the back of his head, unsure. "I've never seen the External Artifact fight on its own. They usually have quite a few subordinates willing to do their bidding for energy."</p><br><p>Heret shook his head disapprovingly.</p><br><p>"Adam, you are using Risha methods that work for you. But, if this has become an opportunity for you to step forward, she might just die, here and now. Furthermore, even if she wins, what does she get in the end?</p><br><p>"One strong ability from her External Artifact that will complement her Initial Gene? I mean, it will definitely make her stronger, but it's not the power she needs right now. No matter how powerful and unique your ability is, if your enemy is at a different evolutionary level, it's like throwing rocks against a steel wall. The stones may be sharp and rare, but they're still stones..."</p><br><p>Unlike the serpents wearing depressed moods, Adam was more than confident in his decision.</p><br><p>"The dark field," he said firmly.</p><br><p>Vorx turned around. "Hmm?"</p><br><p>"If she hadn't then taken a few extra steps despite the pain, there's no way I would have gone to such measures. But, she did," Adam shrugged.</p><br><p>With a menacing look, Heret turned to him. "And? You decided to jeopardize her just because of that?"</p><br><br><p>"Then what other reason did you have for doing it?"</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand. "Risha and Radiant Mirage, they're pretty much similar. They're both like annoying teens, so they'll work together."</p><br><p>"What...?" Heret gasped. "You're making these decisions based on that? It's not like you and your External Artifact are soul mates."</p><br><p>"Well, we made a deal, and we each honored our obligations. That's good enough."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>White pulses emanated from the huge mirror when out appeared the frame of a tall, formidable mirror knight, that one was much larger than the knight that had met them at the entrance.</p><br><p>In his right hand was a long, shining sword, leaving a trail of tiny crystals behind it at the slightest movement. In his right hand, he held a tower shield with spike-like sharp corners and a smooth mirror in the center, ready to deflect any of Risha's attacks.</p><br><p>Glittering armor covered the knight's entire body, from his boots to his bulky helmet, two stars glowing behind dark slits.</p><br><p>Risha gulped, raising her head.</p><br><p>The mirror knight was big enough to take Risha in a tight embrace and snap her in two like a match.</p><br><br><p>Streams of energy came out of the star-crystal, transforming into a small core and landing in the knight's chest. For a moment, a shadow resembling a young man in black robes passed through the crystal.</p><br><p>Then, from the core came a voice, still mechanical, but more human than proceeding directly from the crystal.</p><br><p>"As is the deal... I will fight against you, it is me, not my subordinates..." Radiant Mirage said in a deep voice.</p><br><p>Risha took a step back, her Foundation Artifact appearing on her wrist. The bracelet with the ominous skull was ready to channel energy into her next swing. Scarlet energy claws covered her hands, sharp and deadly.</p><br><p>"But, this knight... Isn't that your subordinate?"</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage nodded deeply. "Yes, but I will be using him as my puppet right now. All movements, attacks, and blocks will be controlled by me. I hope that's all you wanted to say. I, as the External Artifact, take the pact as seriously as possible."</p><br><p>"Sure, I'm not questioning your intentions. I'm ready to begin at any moment!" Risha swung her axe, her swing causing aggressive wind currents to shatter nearby crystals.</p><br><p>A red glint ran through her eyes as her muscles tensed and her fangs grew a little longer, her veins swelled while a wild red aura ran through her body.</p><br><p>Adam, watching her from afar, nodded weakly.</p><br><p>'I see... So this is her Initial Gene? Well, considering that many of her abilities are related to the wild beast to some degree, it fits.'</p><br><br><p>The mirror knight stepped forward, in a heartbeat, bringing his sword down on Risha.</p><br><p>Then, Risha decided to make her first mistake in this fight. Instead of simply evading and trying to attack the knight from the side, at weak points like legs and gaps in the armor, she raised her axe, going to block the Radiant Mirage's strike.</p><br><p>The beam of light following the sword struck Risha, yet despite her feet sinking into the ground, she struggled to keep up the pressure.</p><br><p>'Alright... Once I gather my strength, I'll be able to throw him aside and stab him with all my might right in the chest! If I break the core, then he can't fight me following the agreement! Risha internally exclaimed, tensing her arms.</p><br><br><p>Before she could lunge, a rumbling sound came from outside, causing Risha to turn around.</p><br><p>The mirror knight let go of her heavy shield, it collapsed to the ground, freeing the knight's arm.</p><br><p>"That was stupid..." Radiant Mirage uttered as the knight opened his palm.</p><br><p>A bright beam of light flew outward, raining down on Risha with all its scalding power. All she could do was keep her grip around the hilt.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>Risha's back smashed through several crystals until she swung her axe, launching a wave of screaming skulls to stop the beam.</p><br><p>Saying nothing, Radiant Mirage raised her shield, a menacing stride heading toward Risha.</p><br><p>"Gha... Gha... Gha..." she breathed heavily, clots of blood falling to the ground under her painful croaks.</p><br><p>She reflected the mirror knight's beam after only a few seconds, but it was enough to leave a severe burn and gash on her shoulder.</p><br><p>"Come on..." Radiant Mirage raised his sword high, condensing all the energy into a single point. "Is that all you're capable of? In fact... I think you have a chance of sticking to the terms of the pact..."</p><br><p>Not a word about winning or losing.</p><br><p>As Adam suspected, Radiant Mirage wanted to see something else in Risha.</p><br><p>It was important to him that she show her will, that even death did not frighten her.</p><br><p>"Tsk," Risha spat out a clot of blood. "Don't worry, I have enough strength to fight!"</p><br><p>The four-pointed star shone in her eye as she turned into a crimson flash, attacking the great knight from all directions like a wild comet.</p>
