            <br><p>The events above were unfolding in a very active manner, the scale was constantly growing and the monsters were becoming more and more numerous.
</p><br><p>A single monster was able to affect the situation significantly, but there was still a long way to go before one side won, given that there were only three parties - the Phantoms, the monsters from the waves, and the fortress. Everyone had their own goals, but... someone was representing the fourth side, alone.
</p><br><br><p>One Phantom, the first to enter the fortress was rapidly running forward, keeping the bank of the bloody river as his guide.
</p><br><p>Monsters tried to attack him, some to protect the temple, some to plunge him into the river to speed up the upcoming ritual, and some just wanted to take his energy.
</p><br><p>Yet, they were unable to even get close to this Phantom, every step he took was accompanied by a flame burst, the rings of fire spreading around easily burned the weak monsters in just a few seconds, even the enhanced regeneration near the river did not help them.
</p><br><p>Those who were stronger, such as the Thirst Redeemers or the numerous Vile Believers, were not so weak that they could be instantly burned in the red flames, but they could not expect to win either.
</p><br><p>They could only watch helplessly as one single Phantom made its own rules, gradually approaching the deepest point in the Lands of the Lone Serpent, the temple’s borders.
</p><br><p>[How do you like my power...? Impressive isn’t it?]
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze’s voice boomed in Adam’s head, it seemed to have a satisfied smirk, though External Artifacts had no faces.
</p><br><p>In response, Adam only nodded slightly, taking another bursting leap forward.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, I was skeptical at first, but... it seems like each of the sun seal crystals is superior to the previous one, right?"
</p><br><p>His cold, calm eyes traveled lower, watching his fiery needle.
</p><br><p>"My needle, my First Order got much stronger, but flaming steps are a whole other level."
</p><br><p>[Yes, although it doesn’t only depend on the sun seal. I can sense that your strength is increasing. It’s most likely due to the trials that await you, you’ve gotten very close to them...]
</p><br><p>"Sure, it’s been too long. I should become a K3-Phantom, and then... I think I’ll finally be strong enough to face him."
</p><br><p>Taking a few more long spurts, the outline of the great temple appeared in the distance. But, no sooner had Adam gotten a proper look at it than something distracted him.
</p><br><p>"Hmm? Is it just me, or is it suddenly becoming colder... Is that possible?"
</p><br><p>This time, it was Silvana’s turn:
</p><br><p>’There’s a lot of events going on in the upper level. I don’t know what the outcome will be, many strong monsters appeared and there are global changes.’
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, she continued:
</p><br><p>’Adam, I can’t know this for sure, but I think that in the next hour, the fortress may fall. The Phantoms may not be able to handle the defense of the walls.’
</p><br><p>Stay connected via Freewebnovel
</p><br><p>"Hmm? That’s odd..."
</p><br><p>Adam frowned his eyebrows, particles of flame reflecting in his blue eyes.
</p><br><p>’I mean, there are a lot of monsters during the Eclipse, but was there no one really strong among the Phantoms? Last time I participated in the defense of Bastion Radon, I’d say the most impressive fighter in my group was Alexia, not me."
</p><br><p>Realizing his confusion, Silvana nodded deeply, yet she didn’t want to tell him too much since he had an important and deadly mission ahead of him, right in the temple.
</p><br><p>’Sure, there are quite a few strong fighters among the Phantoms, but... one of them, the leader, has serious problems in a battle against the main monster.’
</p><br><p>Adam’s face distorted for a moment.
</p><br><p>’’Tsk, I’m not going to go back and help them. Moreover... despite Eclipse from above, there’s a threat here from below, isn’t it?"
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze trembled slightly, a slight heat traveled down Adam’s chest from the sun seal.
</p><br><p>[Yes, the bloody river appeared here for a reason, and... this blood, it’s not created by energy.]
</p><br><p>Adam looked away, he had noticed it a moment ago but was in no hurry to jump to conclusions prematurely.
</p><br><p>"I see it, the flow got stronger. Up there, monsters and Phantoms are constantly dying, the Eclipse is the best time for the river to reach the peak of its power."
</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam remembered the missing body of the Mighty Commander, the same was true for the Solitary Commander.
</p><br><p>He didn’t know where their bodies had disappeared, but now he had a guess, although the method was still unknown to him.
</p><br><p>[Adam, the monsters are preparing to finish the ritual. Then the creature I fear so much will awaken. You must hurry and finish the ritual before it happens.]
</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam sprinted forward, accelerating sharply. The end of the bloody river was revealed to his eyes, it was hiding under a massive stone slab, disappearing into the darkness and filling the temple grounds with its power.
</p><br><p>"Do you know how much time I have?"
</p><br><p>[No... I can only feel the aura that frightens me becoming more and more powerful, I’m scared...]
</p><br><p>With a serious face, not wanting to seem ruthless, Adam slowly said:
</p><br><p>"Don’t worry coward, I’ve met some very dangerous guys. I don’t think I’ll give up this time, so I’ll win."
</p><br><p>After a while, Lone Blaze hesitantly said:
</p><br><p>[You’re talking about the Plague Reaper, aren’t you?]
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes went wide for a moment, surprise mixed with confusion read on his face.
</p><br><p>"What...? How do you know? Are you supposed to?"
</p><br><p>[I’ve never encountered this monster, but I’ve heard of it... More to the point... For some reason, I sense a part of the Plague Reaper in you, something deep inside the two strange walls in your inner space.]
</p><br><p>It was weird, but Adam didn’t pay much attention to it. After all, this was the first time he’d worked with External Artifact.
</p><br><p>"Anyway, I beat him."
</p><br><p>[Yes... Adam. If you don’t break the ritual, I feel a more dangerous opponent awaits you...]
</p><br><p>Two emotions were simultaneously reflected in Adam’s eyes: fear and the desire to fight.
</p><br><p>"Stronger than the Plague Reaper you say...? Well, it’s too late to run away."
</p><br><p>Adam raised his gaze looking at the scarlet lights illuminating the massive columns reaching the top of the huge cavern. Many silhouettes waited for him, sensing his approach.</p>
