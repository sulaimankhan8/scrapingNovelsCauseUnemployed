            <br><p>Basically, the only question Adam had left was how Orel and Misa made contact. They didn't have the ideal case that Orel mentioned in the beginning, nor was it a situation with Adam and Silvana where there was plenty of time to bond with each other.</p><br><p>In fact, it was those two cases for the Lower Ring that were the anomaly. Most of the Phantoms and Operators were going through the same path as Orel and Misa.</p><br><p>"Well, it's pretty simple."</p><br><p>Orel shrugged, guiding the two puzzles towards each other.</p><br><p>"First, you spend time together to get to know each other better and for the Operator's resentment to gradually subside. Don't forget that it is almost always the Phantom who comes to his future Operator and takes them by force. It works the same way with candidates wishing to become Operators on their own."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, he already grasped that.</p><br><p>"After the Phantom and the Operator have gotten used to each other and both realize their position, the Phantom directs his energy directly at the Operator maintaining physical contact. If you're wondering about my case, I simply held Misa's hands. This allowed her to get into something similar to my inner space."</p><br><p>Now, Silvana nodded affirmatively. She could only get to Adam's inner space when Adam opened the first lesser gates and got the Stellar Resonance. Technically, at the K2-Level she was also in Adam's inner space, but in a special chamber where her Evolution Seed was located.</p><br><p>It doesn't matter what part of Adam's inner space it was, though. The Evolution Tree could communicate with her, but she had no way to influence on that decision.</p><br><p>Orel directed the energy toward the puzzles. "Naturally, we couldn't succeed the first time otherwise it could be called the perfect case. But, we don't have time either, at the Lower Ring life moves fast, so the next day we did the same thing, but...</p><br><p>"I acted much tougher and rougher. If the first time I simply invited Misa into my inner space with my energy, then on the second day I forcibly entered her mind and memories."</p><br><p>"Wait...!" Adam stammered. "Are you talking about the Gene Diffusion?"</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide for a moment. She remembered well how they had gone through the Gene Diffusion together. Back then, Adam had released energy until he passed out, that energy made contact with Silvana and led her straight to the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Orel hummed. "That's the closest comparison, but it's not entirely accurate. No matter how much energy I would have let out of myself, it wouldn't have brought Misa into my inner space."</p><br><p>Bafflement reflected on Silvana's face as she tilted her head. "Why? We haven't had any problems with that."</p><br><p>"Yeah, because Adam's Evolution Tree was familiar with you. It knew what kind of person you were, what decisions you made, what you thought and felt. The Gene Diffusion you were going through was just the final test.</p><br><p>"Therefore, all it took for Adam was to simply release his energy and his Evolution Tree contacted you. My Evolution Tree has only been familiar with Misa for a few days like me. In that case, another method is needed. I channeled energy not from myself but into Misa, forcing her into my inner space."</p><br><p>Orel shook his head as the energy filled one puzzle, the other remained intact.</p><br><p>"In fact, the Phantom is forcing the Operator and the Evolution Tree to meet. The Evolution Tree realizes what's going on so the Phantom's energy doesn't harm the Operator, at least at first. Then, you're trying to create a connection where three parties need to agree - the Phantom, the Operator, and the Evolution Tree."</p><br><p>With a serious look, Adam folded his arms. "How does that work?"</p><br><p>"Very simple. As I said a forceful Gene Diffusion takes place. Misa saw my memories and intentions, I saw her. At any time the trial can be interrupted due to the uncertainty of one party. Most of the time it's the Operator's part."</p><br><p>Then, Orel guided the left puzzle to the right one, forcing the right one to crumple under the energy pressure.</p><br><p>"You repeat this process over and over. The Phantom is trying to convince the Operator to work together, in his feelings, intentions, and ambitions. It happens differently for everyone. If I were a romantic, I would compare it to when people fall in love at first sight and go straight to action."</p><br><p>The right puzzle was slowly being pushed through, taking the shape to fit the left.</p><br><p>"It could end well or it could end badly, but one thing is certain, the story only begins when one of the two is interested, but they could both end up falling in love with each other. All it takes is the right actions, assertiveness, similarity of personality, and luck."</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the two puzzles fit together. Unlike the second time, Orel had made the two puzzles match, now only one of them changed.</p><br><p>"Number one in pair," Orel picked up the left puzzle remaining in its original shape.</p><br><p>Then, he picked up the right puzzle, reshaped for the first one. "And the number two."</p><br><p>Orel's gaze deepened.</p><br><p>"You and Silvana, you've changed for each other, but at the Lower Ring, the Phantoms are changing Operators for themselves. Sure, I'm willing to make compromises and understand Misa as much as she does me, but I'm the one who started the whole process. When I saw her I wanted to make her my Operator, she didn't know what was waiting for her.</p><br><p>"However, that doesn't mean that Operators of the Lower Ring can't reach the same depth of understanding as Silvana. It's just that we have fewer chances to do so, as it takes luck to get someone who is genuinely willing to be your Operator, to accept you, and to open up completely."</p><br><p>Silvana remained stumped, but Adam nodded thoughtfully.</p><br><p>"I see... You gave the example of love at first sight, but another comparison came to my mind."</p><br><p>"Hm?" he raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"When two wealthy families, nobles, forcibly marry off their children for the sake of strengthening the relationship and a favorable deal. It most likely won't end well for the two youths, which is why you had three Operators before Misa, but there's always a chance of success.</p><br><p>"Nine out of ten couples will be unhappy, but in one out of ten, it will turn out that the youths are perfect for each other.</p><br>
