            <br><p>To seriously wound one's opponent was one of the quickest ways to victory. Failure to do so left only one option: to fight long and torturously, until the opponent was exhausted.</p><br><p>Adam and Fromund were well aware of this, but most of the time, due to the nature of their abilities, they were at a great distance from each other.</p><br><p>Sure, a few attempts were made, the most notable of which was the flaming meteor, but it was not a success.</p><br><p>Unlike the situation they now find themselves in.</p><br><br><p>Fromund's right arm flew off to the side, it wasn't just one of his limbs and main arm, he lost his weapon - the black sword was gone as well, at least until Fromund decided to pick it up, but with his left hand.</p><br><p>This seemed to be the turning point of the fight, now some spectators could breathe a sigh of relief, while for others it was a disaster.</p><br><p>However... no sooner had the audience had the first emotions on their faces than a new event forced them to change places.</p><br><p>"ARRRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHH!!!"</p><br><p>A painful cry spread across the arena, lingering and penetrating to the core, sending an ominous, unpleasant chill.</p><br><p>The flames quickly burned away the flesh on Adam's face, turning his skin into nothing, wanting to do the same to his right eye.</p><br><p>The realization of Adam's pain along with his screams gave the onlookers goosebumps, the cold filling their backs - no one would want to be in his shoes.</p><br><p>Even though, thanks to the barrier, they were in no danger, it was painful and unpleasant to watch. It seemed they could feel Adam's pain, the smell of his burning flesh, and the massive scorch that would definitely remain on his face.</p><br><p>Silvana gasped, her eyes wide in horror.</p><br><p>Was Arayna pleased? After all, with that move, her Phantom came much closer to victory.</p><br><br><p>She wasn't a sadist to take pleasure and feel joy at Adam's suffering, moreover, she could see that Fromund was in pain too, though he tried not to show it.</p><br><p>'Shit... Fromund, what on earth have you done? Is it worth it?' Arayna inwardly said in a trembling voice.</p><br><p>Then, her eyes traveled to Fromund's right arm and his sword - the hilt was still firmly clutched in his hand.</p><br><p>'You lost your main arm for the sake of covering his right eye? That... that could be a serious mistake...'</p><br><p>Strangely enough, there was no joy in any of the Operators, among the spectators, only the most bloodthirsty and eager for a brutal spectacle were enjoying this rare moment.</p><br><br><p>Explore more adventures at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Adam's left fist clenched tightly, actively shaking from the purple waves passing along his arm.</p><br><p>"Get the fuck away from me!"</p><br><p>With a soul-crushing scream, Adam's gravity-defying fist slammed into Fromund's chest.</p><br><p>Before Fromund could blink, the impact rained down on his body, the powerful momentum throwing him to the other side of the arena like a projectile, with as much power as Fromund had never seen before in their fight.</p><br><p>He was half buried in the stone wall before he realized it, his ribcage cracking from the direct impact with pure physical power.</p><br><p>But... this did not cause Silvana to feel any relief, she only bit her lip with great grimace.</p><br><p>'That was the second one. He's already wasted two gravity strikes, and it's unlikely he'll be able to do it again. In that case... Adam has practically nothing left. He hasn't fully utilized his Nexus yet, but that is all...'</p><br><p>She knew as well as any Operator what her Phantom's abilities were, as well as the situation in general. It took Silvana a few seconds to remember what abilities they were using and what else could help Adam, even if only in theory.</p><br><p>Then, her eyes went wide with the realization that Adam still had one trump card.</p><br><p>'Right... Even though it hasn't happened so far, not against Damien, not against Max or Tron, Adam still hasn't unlocked all of his abilities gained after going to K2-Level. But... what about Fromund? He hasn't used his Elemental Root yet and... he might have a trump card like Adam too...'</p><br><p>Standing nearby, Arayna watched Silvana's reaction intently. She couldn't read minds, but she guessed what Silvana was thinking based on her expression.</p><br><p>Crumble. Crumble. Crumble.</p><br><p>Fromund climbed out of the wall, the right side of his body was covered in blood, from the smeared blood flowing out of the open wound on his arm and from the collision against the barrier.</p><br><br><p>A stream of blood gushed from his mouth, accompanied by a muffled but deep pain in his chest.</p><br><p>'Fuck... if he had attacked me from a more advantageous position with more speed, he would break all my ribs, but I got away with mere cracks, yet...'</p><br><p>His blue eyes twitched to the left, clots of blood falling from his arm, making him weaker every second.</p><br><p>This couldn't go on any longer, Fromund must somehow stop the bleeding or he would fail due to trivial blood loss.</p><br><p>"Damn... I shouldn't use my flame like this, but it looks like there's no other choice."</p><br><p>Taking a heavy breath, Fromund abruptly covered his shoulder, sealing the wound with his flame. Bright pain reflected on his face, but Fromund gritted his teeth tightly, not wanting his scream to be seen by anyone.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Fromund breathed a sigh of relief at the glance on his shoulder - the heavy burn stopped the bleeding.</p><br><p>Then, with slight hope, Fromund glared at his opponent - he'd given his arm for his brazenness, so expected to see the look of despair on Adam's face.</p><br><p>A cold, sharp gaze was directed at Fromund, Adam's blue eye staring intently at him wanting to blaze through him.</p><br><p>Adam held onto the right side of his face before slowly removing his hand revealing a burn covering all around his eye that he would never be able to open again, not during this fight.</p><br><p>Without the amber grid, Adam's Second Order had lost most of its power, the threads still covered his body making him stronger, but his attacks would no longer be as accurate and fast, especially when using the threads.</p><br><p>Said not a word, Adam lowered himself sharply to the ground. He wasn't going to give up or prepare to lunge - he wanted to destroy everything that was between him and Fromund.</p><br><br><p>His palms leaned against the ground, then gauntlets began to shake actively, in less than a second the vibrations accelerated several times.</p><br><br><p>Fromund's eyes went wide, he was surprised to see Adam's Nexus have such an ability. The trembling quickly got to him, Fromund could feel the ground beneath him becoming unstable ready to shatter into pieces.</p><br><p>Soon, the first cracks showed coming from Adam's fingertips.</p><br><p>There was no fear in Fromund's eyes, only surprise and a strange delight as if he had met something familiar.</p><br><p>"Alright, looks like we've both come to the same point."</p><br><p>Fromund grinned widely before raising his foot high about to make a powerful stomp.</p><br><p>But... Could a simple stomp stop such a potent vibration?</p><br><p>If it was an ordinary stomp then it would hardly make any difference, yet Fromund's surprise had its reason.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>His Elemental Root, powerful and sturdy, shook vigorously, then amber waves of energy enveloped his right leg lifting small stones from the ground, causing them to hover in the air.</p>
