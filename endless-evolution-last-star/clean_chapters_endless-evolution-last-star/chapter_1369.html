            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1369: How to Defeat the Past?</strong></p><br><p>Even though the Silver Weaver was a dangerous monster that nearly killed Adam, as happened with Phantom, who saved him that day, in reality, this monster was not as dangerous as it might have seemed.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver was a unique monster at the time, but he reached his peak power at the Purple Threat Level. Obviously, Adam encountered the Silver Weaver when the monster was in its weakest state. That was the only reason Adam was able to survive and kill the Silver Weaver with his level of power.</p><br><p>But, even though the Purple Threat Level was quite a high threshold for most Phantoms, for Adam, it was nothing. The Yellow, Red, and Black Threat Levels, as well as the Elders, were tens and even hundreds of times stronger than a normal Purple Threat Level monster.</p><br><p>Moreover, on his way, Adam defeated the Top-1 Purple Threat Level Monster – the Plague Reaper. For him, this threat level posed no problem.</p><br><p>However, since it was a trial from the White Spire, Adam’s opponent could not be significantly weaker than him. Otherwise, the trial would lose its meaning.</p><br><p>Adam expressed his desire, and the Part of White Spire rated it at the highest level, which means that the difficulty will be appropriate.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With each passing second, the space trembled more intensely as the gusts of wind emanating from the Silver Weaver blew gray sand particles aside.</p><br><p>Adam covered his eyes with his hand, watching the Silver Weaver’s evolution intently through the gaps in his fingers.</p><br><p>Every monster could evolve, but that didn’t mean every monster went through the process. Most either died before reaching their limit or reached a barrier they were unable to break through.</p><br><p>But, in theory, anyone, even a White Threat Level monster, could evolve dozens of times, eventually reaching the Lord Level.</p><br><p>Sure, this happened extremely rarely, sometimes, the evolution of one particular monster did not go more than a few levels up, not to mention the Lord Level. The main thing is that, at least to some extent, such precedents did exist.</p><br><p>Each monster’s evolution was different. Some became stronger, gained new abilities, and changed significantly in appearance, while others could only increase their aura with minor changes.</p><br><p>Now, Adam could only watch and wait for the changes that would happen to the Silver Weaver. He didn’t know how his first monster would change and could only guess.</p><br><p>One thing was clear to Adam — the changes would be significant.</p><br><br><p>Well, because the same thing happened to him. Numerous power-ups and evolution brought him to his current level of power.</p><br><p>“What a powerful aura and energy!” Adam exclaimed inwardly as he looked at the bright, white flame that completely covered the dark Silver Weaver. This energy was similar to his, more than the energy of any other monster or Phantom he had encountered.</p><br><br><p>With one last pulse, a shockwave emanated from the Silver Weaver as a bright flash revealed his new form.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes went wide as he looked at the Silver Weaver, whose fur was now completely white, with rare black hairs sticking out like blades. Strangely, the Silver Weaver had lost his tail, as well as the second pair of ears that had previously been at the bottom of his head.</p><br><p>His body was no longer as large, but looked more athletic and lean and far more menacing, radiating unbridled physical power. The silver threads now wandered all over his body and not just his paws, serving as his weapon, armor, and exoskeleton.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver’s neck became shorter, but his eyes acquired a deep green glow with a round pupil instead of the usual vertical slit, unusual for a monster.</p><br><p>Adam gulped, sensing that the Silver Weaver’s aura was at the High Elder Level.</p><br><p>Unlike the Silver Gargoyle, Crystal Golem, and Azure Wyvern, his power level had not been raised to the Lord Level, but for some reason, Adam saw this as a much greater threat.</p><br><p>“This…” He stammered. “He didn’t borrow power from another creature like the guards did, this is his power at this power level. So this is what you would look like if I met you now, right?”</p><br><p>After a short pause, the Silver Weaver nodded slightly as if answering Adam’s question.</p><br><p>Then, the silver threads soared around the Silver Weaver, reminiscent of Gareyna’s control level over the threads. The treads were calm, but threatening at the same time.</p><br><p>“Alright, I don’t know what your plan is, the White Spire, but I will accept this fight with honor and all my heart.” Adam stretched out his hand, summoning the Dual Demon Sword.</p><br><p>Without hesitation, he swung his sword as two blue, lightning-like wings unfolded on his back, giving him a speed boost.</p><br><p>He didn’t know what the Silver Weaver’s weaknesses were, but he attacked and put all his strength into it.</p><br><p>‘I don’t know how this battle will go, but if I want to achieve the Desire of Beyond, I have to give it my all. Now, I am fighting not only against a dangerous monster, but against my past and the source of my power.’</p><br><br><p>Adam lunged forward, launching a lightning projectile that should have reached the Silver Weaver in a fraction of a second.</p><br><br><br><p>The silver threads caught the lightning projectile, stopping it in midair despite its unstable state.</p><br><p>‘W-What?’ Adam blinked, puzzled. ‘Why isn’t it exploding?’</p><br><p>Before Adam’s eyes, the lightning projectile lost all its power, its energy simply dissipating into the threads, showing that getting through this unusual defense would not be easy.</p><br><p>“Grh.” The Silver Weaver let out a low, dissatisfied growl as his frame trembled.</p><br><p>Like a ghost, the Silver Weaver appeared in front of Adam, who, acting on instinct, raised his sword in defense.</p><br><p>A cascade of threads crashed down on him and his blades, covering Adam’s body with numerous cuts and throwing him back, causing him to slide down the sandy hill straight into the tar lake.</p><br><p>He found himself back where it all began, and it was unknown whether a happy ending awaited him this time.</p>
