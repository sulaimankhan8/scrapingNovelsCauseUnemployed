            <br><br><p>Silvana paced from side to side, the fight between Adam and Reinz only half an hour away. From the end of the betting until now, she as the Operator had been trying to find all the information she could about Reinz, and she had succeeded.</p><br><p>However, this was not good news, because Silvana wanted Adam to win, but the more she learned about Reinz, the more she had doubts about it.</p><br><p>What was Adam doing in the meantime?</p><br><br><p>He was lying on his bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. His thoughts were occupied not with the battle, but with the development of the Crystal Gates.</p><br><p>Although he managed to open the first lesser gates thanks to Silvana, there were still four more to come. Maybe new abilities awaited him, general amplifications, he didn't know that, nor did he know the conditions for opening the gates.</p><br><p>'Hmm... I guess I'll figure it out in time. When my trial was the Two Walls it was pretty hard to understand anything, but the Crystal Gates have already become a part of me.'</p><br><p>Adam closed his eyes, visualizing the image of the gates without going into the inner space.</p><br><p>'I just need to get that power, somehow it's similar to the fights here at the Twilight Palace. You can fight anyone at any time, but only coin fights matter. Only when I open the lesser gates will I be able to seize all the new power.'</p><br><p>Then, a shadow fell upon him, from Silvana towering over him, her gaze stern and her hands at her sides.</p><br><p>"Khm! Adam, you fight ahead of you against a VERY serious opponent. Shouldn't you at least take some time to prepare?"</p><br><p>Adam yawned lazily, stretching his arms up as if after a long nap.</p><br><p>"Hm? I'm ready for a strong opponent. I mean, Reinz is strong if you bet 3 billion on him, but I've beaten plenty of strong opponents, and lost too..." he scratched the back of his head awkwardly.</p><br><p>"It's not that simple." Silvana shook her head gravely as she straightened up, "Reinz a K3-Phantom from the first great family, that's saying a lot. Also, as I found out he's been here for a month and has only had one fight in that time!"</p><br><p>"And...?" Adam raised an eyebrow, "I mean, he's just like any other noble who wants a perfect score. You have three coins at the beginning, so if he hasn't left this place yet, he's either got zero or one win."</p><br><p>"Sure, but... the thing is, he defeated his first opponent two weeks ago. He was forced to fight, and you know what he did?"</p><br><p>Silvana leaned in, "He did it with just his aura! His opponent was also a K3 novice, but their difference in strength was so great."</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam's eyes went wide. He didn't expect to hear something like that, however, it didn't change his attitude.</p><br><p>"Well, his opponent was probably too weak and just realized there was no point in fighting any further. Is there anything else?"</p><br><p>"Of course! Countless successful missions, defeating the most dangerous monsters of any Threat Level, whether he be a K0 or K2 phantom, he has always stood out and defeated dangerous monsters! Moreover, he participated in The Rule of Power just like you."</p><br><p>"Oh, Rule of Power? Hah, that sounds interesting," a slight smirk appeared on his face, "Did someone decide to marry him too? That would be fun."</p><br><p>Silvana waved her hand irritably, she was not in the mood for jokes.</p><br><p>"No, there was some conflict between the Alderran Family and the Valthorn Family, I didn't go into details, but it's something serious. They're two great families in the same wing, they wouldn't resort to The Rule of Power without a solid reason."</p><br><br><p>"I'm just tired of reading in the news about what a genius and talented fighter Reinz is! I realize that as an Operator I can't evaluate his power accurately, especially from the information I've managed to find, but he's definitely not an easy opponent!"</p><br><p>Oddly enough, this failed to impress Adam. He only rolled onto the side, looking at the crumpled pillow.</p><br><p>'Talent and genius, right?' he mused, 'Those are words that are nice to hear, but... can you say the same about the Plague Reaper or the Crimson Monarch?'</p><br><p>Adam shook his head internally, 'Nah, those two are just fucking strong, that's all. Is talent a power? Could it be a direct path to power? I doubt it.'</p><br><p>Then, Adam blinked as his eyes grew darker, deeper like two abysses.</p><br><p>'It's all about your desire. Without it, you won't win fights where you were supposed to lose. And for fights where your victory was predetermined, well... in those you learn little.'</p><br><br><p>Despite Adam's nonchalance, Silvana still instructed him on the basic things he needed to know about his opponent.</p><br><p>As observer no, 2 had said, the fight would take place at the North Arch where a crowd had already gathered.</p><br><p>There was no room to spare on the ground, on the bridges, and the chambers in the walls. After all, there couldn't be a more important fight than this one at the moment.</p><br><p>Both fighters would leave the Twilight Palace afterward, some with victory and some with defeat. Obviously, the nobles were cheering for Reinz, but many were curious to see how Adam would perform.</p><br><p>Silvana was left behind.</p><br><p>Adam entered the arena where Reinz was waiting for him.</p><br><p>They didn't say anything, because as soon as Adam appeared the crowd began to disperse, allowing a medium-height silhouette to move forward.</p><br><p>It was a girl with spiky black hair gathered in a bun, wearing a long gray coat and a wide scar over her right eye, her green eyes staring at everyone around her like shit.</p><br><p>Her look, her outfit, and even her gait were not like the others at the Twilight Palace.</p><br><p>Yet, she was an observer no. 1 she was the second person after Andreas.</p><br><p>"Good, everyone's here."</p><br><p>The girl nodded deeply as she crossed her arms over her chest.</p><br><p>"Then it's time for the real bets," she looked up as if addressing the guests through the cameras, "It's time to bet your territories!"</p>
