            <br><p>'Come on, commoner, don't disappoint me.' Aiden pondered, staring intently at Glara. He couldn't wait to see if it all made sense if he should waste his time on her.</p><br><p>Now and then he would glance at Shiny's glass crystal, which was black since it showed Glara's inner space.</p><br><p>He was trying to figure out what Glara was special about, or rather he already knew a few of her features.</p><br><p>'For one thing, upon contact with her brother's Nexus, energy traveled through her body, most likely also affected by the presence of another Phantom, in this case, it was Adam Vinter. Perhaps the fact that he is the Natural One has some significance.'</p><br><br><p>'Secondly, she's got the Inner Space, that's never happened before with normal humans or Phantoms. You either have the inner space, the Spark, and so on, or you have nothing. There was simply no other option, at least not until now.'</p><br><p>Then, Aiden glanced at the glass crystal that was even darker than before, the darkness thickening like thunderclouds, overlapping each other in several layers.</p><br><p>'But... what's the point of all this? That's the main question I'm trying to find an answer to. Natta's question is still relevant. What difference does it make that she appears in the inner space if she goes the same path as the other Phantoms?'</p><br><p>Your next chapter awaits on empire</p><br><p>Then, Aiden cast a glance at Glara.</p><br><p>'It's not a fact that she'll become the Artificial Phantom, she might not become a Phantom at all because Natta and Sano had to step in. Well, they didn't hurt the Redcore Wolf in any way so it should be fine, the chances of her becoming the Phantom are about 90%, but only the Artificial One.'</p><br><p>Aiden rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p><br><p>'The mere fact that they fought and activated the genes inside their exoskeletons and False Nexuses, that's already enough to taint the genes. For Phantom to become the Naturalborn One, the purity of the genes must be 100%, only Glara's and the Redcore Wolf's genes. There shouldn't be anyone else's genes around, the active ones, that were involved in the battle.'</p><br><p>In fact, if Natta and Sano were to attack the Redcore Wolf right now and use their abilities to tear the monster apart, then Glara wouldn't become a Phantom, since to become a Phantom in that case one needed the Spark, and she didn't have the Spark, only the inner space.</p><br><p>But, since they didn't attack the Redcore Wolf but only the Shadow, they technically didn't participate in Glara's battle in any way, they were just fighting on the sidelines.</p><br><p>However, because it was happening in the same room and time, it was possible that their genes prevented Glara from becoming a Phantom, but the chance of that happening was small, Aiden gave it a 10% chance.</p><br><p>Sure, usually a person couldn't become anything but the Naturalborn Phantom without the Spark, but the same fate awaited Glara. Death or the Natural Phantom, there was no other option, the Artificial Phantoms appeared differently.</p><br><p>Yet, because of the Shadow's arrival causing Natta's and Glara's involvement, she could not become the Naturalborn Phantom.</p><br><p>However, since Natta and Sano weren't Phantoms and only used exoskeletons and FNs, and didn't attack the Redcore Wolf, their influence on the genes was as minimal as possible.</p><br><p>Thus, Glara found herself in a complex, obscure, low probability but possible situation that Aiden was well aware existed. He was one of the few people who knew about it.</p><br><p>The situation was as follows:</p><br><p>1) Glara was fighting the monster 1 on 1, as it should be when one wanted to become the Naturalborn Phantom, she was using a high-tech powerful weapon that had no genes in itself.</p><br><p>2) If she killed the Redcore Wolf, she would guarantee becoming the Naturalborn Phantom. However, Sano and Natta were forced to enter the fightfield and activate exoskeletons and FNs with genes inside to deal with the Shadow.</p><br><p>3) Since Sano and Natta's gene influence was minimal due to not being Phantoms and fighting side by side, Glara's gene influence on the Redcore Wolf's genes was still close to maximum.</p><br><p>4) Because of the previous point, the purity of the Redcore Wolf's genes in relation to Glara's was enough to ignite the Spark in her, but not enough for the Spark to be of maximum power for it to grow into the mighty Evolution Tree that would make her the Naturalborn Phantom.</p><br><p>5) To become the Naturalborn Phantom, one needed a maximum, 100% purity of genes, so that the Spark would be at its peak due to the energy of genes.</p><br><p>No one knew or thought about it, as it was too rare and almost impossible to happen under natural conditions, given how the Naturalborn Phantoms appeared and how few they were compared to the Artificial Phantoms.</p><br><p>It was much more likely to happen under artificial conditions and so Aiden was aware of the situation.</p><br><p>However, it was actually all quite logical.</p><br><p>Otherwise, people wouldn't become Phantoms if there were simply other creatures, monsters, or Phantoms around them.</p><br><p>Roughly speaking, if Sano and Natta were fighting somewhere further away, like on a battlefield where there was plenty of area, there was no way their genes would interfere with Glara and the Redcore Wolf.</p><br><p>Moreover, Gladius was very powerful, but since he was inactive and his genes didn't interact with this battle, his influence was zero and didn't disturb Glara in any way. The same applied to Shiny, the Spark Seeker subordinate to Aiden.</p><br><p>Also, it was difficult to find out since no one other than Aiden did any artificial experiments to create the Naturalborn Phantoms.</p><br><p>When the military helped people become Phantoms, those people already had the Sparks, and their interference was dozens of times stronger than Sano and Natta's. The military and the Phantoms would literally bring the monster to the brink of death so that the human would strike the final blow and become the Phantom.</p><br><p>For all these complicated reasons, this situation remained in the shadows. Not that it had frequent use or application, but any knowledge was valuable, Aiden understood that well.</p><br><p>If he didn't know it, he would order Sano and Natta to attack the Redcore Wolf, reducing Glara's chances of becoming a Phantom from 90% to 0%.</p><br><p>And... Aiden also realized another equally important thing.</p><br><p>'Everything in this world is connected. Sometimes, having knowledge of one rare occurrence, only then will we be able to see or understand something more unique or simple... The main thing is, without past knowledge, the subsequent ones may remain in the shadows.'</p><br><p>Then, Aiden glanced at the glass crystal once more, where the darkness was at its densest and Glara only had ten seconds left.</p><br><p>'I hope this makes sense. The effectiveness of this experiment depends on one girl with one attack and one shot left.'</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The Redcore Wolf ran at Glara, who with a bitter smile on her face stepped forward, glaring weakly at her enemy.</p><br><p>She already had a plan for victory in her head, a risky one, but she simply had no other.</p><br><p>"Well, let's get this over with." Glara muttered when the Redcore Wolf's appeared in front of her, his wide-open jaw ready to swallow her in one bite.</p>
