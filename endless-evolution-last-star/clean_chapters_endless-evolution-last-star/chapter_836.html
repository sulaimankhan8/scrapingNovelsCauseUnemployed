            <br><p>The Citadel had many secrets. Some of them Adam knew and even forgot they were such - like the existence of the Natural Phantoms, one of which he was himself.</p><br><p>He knew about the unique hybrid Nessa, about the fact that Operators could also have access to energy, about midnight crystals, external artifacts, and many other things that were not available even to Phantoms that had just started on their path, let alone to ordinary people.</p><br><p>But... What he was hearing now, what he saw before his eyes, was impossible to comprehend.</p><br><p>His lips trembled, he couldn't even utter a word. A chill ran down his spine while Douglas's voice repeatedly raced through his mind.</p><br><p>"Queen Elisa...?" Adam mumbled uncertainly, not believing what he heard.</p><br><p>Without a doubt in his gaze, Douglas nodded deeply. Seyrina remained in silence, yet her respect for the girl trapped in the crystal was evident even from afar.</p><br><p>"Yes, Adam. I realize this is a shock to you, but it's true. The Citadel has a Queen, and she is right in front of you."</p><br><p>For a while neither Adam nor Silvana said anything. They stared mesmerized at the great tree, at the crystal full of energy, and at the girl inside who remotely resembled more a statue than a person.</p><br><p>"She's..." Adam gulped, trying not to be rude, "Queen Elisa, is she alive?"</p><br><p>Tension rose. Adam didn't know if it was a good idea to ask that particular question first.</p><br><p>Then, Douglas sighed heavily, he wasn't happy with his answer:</p><br><p>"Sure, but I'm not going to lie to you or hide anything. Even though Queen Elisa is alive, she's practically dead, she's constantly on a borderline state."</p><br><p>The fright reflected on Adam's face. He had only just learned of the queen's existence but realized that regardless of her role, her death would be a disaster for the Citadel.</p><br><p>"What? What does that mean?"</p><br><p>Douglas waved his hand slightly.</p><br><p>"You don't need to worry about that, nothing bad will happen to Queen Elisa, because..." his eyes rose to the crystal, "She's been in this state for a long time, a very long time."</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, Douglas continued:</p><br><p>"However, Queen Elisa cannot leave the crystal, it is a prison and salvation for her, as well as a blessing for the entire Citadel."</p><br><p>Adam turned to Douglas, expecting to hear the worst:</p><br><p>"What happens if the queen disappears? What happens if she dies or the crystal is destroyed?"</p><br><p>As if expecting that question, Douglas shook his head.</p><br><p>"I'm afraid I can't tell you that, not yet. However, I can promise you that the next thing I say is the truth."</p><br><p>With a devoted gaze, watching Queen Elisa plunged into eternal slumber, Douglas stated:</p><br><p>"Queen Elisa is humanity's only hope. Without her, we would have long ago disappeared from this world."</p><br><p>Did Adam want to know more?</p><br><p>Sure, but Douglas pointed out his limits several times, he could only learn a fraction of the secrets. Adam accepted this, he realized that for Heaven Island he was a newcomer, after all, he hadn't even reached K3-Level yet, which was the minimum.</p><br><p>Thus, Adam decided to change the topic, trying to learn more about something else:</p><br><p>"This tree... It's the Evolution Tree, isn't it?"</p><br><p>"Indeed, it is." Douglas replied without question, "It's Queen Elisa's Evolution Tree. She had to do it, it's a long, no... it's an ancient story. You're not strong enough to hear it."</p><br><p>A slight irritation awakened deep inside Adam, but along with it grew respect for Queen Elisa.</p><br><p>He didn't know what she did or why, but even Douglas's obscure phrases were enough for Adam to realize that Queen Elisa made a supreme sacrifice.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes grew deeper, examining Queen Elisa. She looked majestic, but also sad at the same time.</p><br><p>"It's dramatic... She's strong, but it's her destiny to remain here, whatever purpose she fulfills. Even I understand that."</p><br><p>Douglas nodded in affirmation, he saw nothing wrong in Adam's words.</p><br><p>"You're right. However, you should not underestimate Queen Elisa. After all, she is one of the first Phantoms that ever existed."</p><br><p>As Douglas's words rang out, Adam's eyes went wide, not because Queen Elisa was one of the first Phantoms, but because Adam pondered a single thing for the first time.</p><br><p>When had the Phantoms appeared in the first place?</p><br><p>Was it a hundred years ago? Maybe a thousand years? Had the Phantoms existed since the beginning of the world? Then... how old was their world?</p><br><p>It seemed that not even Douglas had an answer to these questions.</p><br><p>"Hmm... I still can't believe what I saw, but..."</p><br><p>Adam slowly turned to Douglas.</p><br><p>"We came here for another reason, didn't we? How can Queen Elisa help me reach K3-Level?"</p><br><p>A bitter smile reflected on Douglas's face.</p><br><p>"Can't you feel how dense the energy here is? All of this is just a tiny fraction of the Queen's aura, it's not even her power."</p><br><p>Then, Douglas pointed to the crystal, to the empty spot under the tree.</p><br><p>"Go there and let Queen Elisa help you. You won't be the first or the last to go through this process."</p><br><p>It seemed Adam should have hurried, but instead, he turned, to meet Silvana's eyes.</p><br><p>"Does she need to come with me?"</p><br><p>With a lost stare, Silvana looked at Douglas.</p><br><p>Soon, his stern voice rang out:</p><br><p>"Absolutely not. The Queen's energy will break every bone in her body as soon as she gets too close. You don't realize it, but this whole place, all of Heaven Island is infused with a dense energy that is hard to find even in the farthest parts of the Dead Lands."</p><br><p>Then, Douglas waved his hand around and pointed at Silvana.</p><br><p>"In fact, if she were not the Operator of the K2-Phantom, she would have passed out as she approached the tree. If she got too close to the queen, she would die within a minute."</p><br><p>Horror reflected on Silvana's face. She hadn't even been aware of such risks.</p><br><p>Unlike her, Adam maintained a calm expression.</p><br><p>"Now, I see why ordinary people are forbidden to enter this place."</p><br><p>He nodded weakly before stepping forward, heading straight for the Queen's great tree.</p><br><p>'One way or another...' Adam thought, 'I have to do this. It would be a fool's errand to refuse the queen's help.'</p>
