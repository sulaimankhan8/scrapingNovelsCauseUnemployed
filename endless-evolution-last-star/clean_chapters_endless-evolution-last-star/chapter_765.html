            <br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>An active tremor went through the entire fortress, unlike the last time, the trembling was over in a few seconds, but something was obvious - it was coming from below, from the depths beneath the fortress.</p><br><p>Trying to figure out what was wrong, Katrin put her palm on the cold surface, feeling the first wave, then the second came a few seconds later.</p><br><p>She had no idea what was going on below, she didn't even know that the fortress had an underground level, since Silvana hadn't given anyone any information about the maze, much less what was below.</p><br><p>But, to Katrin, that shiver was very familiar.</p><br><p>'Wait... it's like someone fighting. I'm sure the same thing would happen if someone or something blocked a powerful attack.'</p><br><p>Then, the puzzles were put into place in her head as her black eyes went wide.</p><br><p>'The Unknown Phantom... No wonder no one has still not found him. He's not just hiding in the fortress, he found a way to pass lower. What's he doing down there?'</p><br><p>Deep inside, Katrin wanted to get up and go in search of the secret passage. She realized that if Alan didn't tell her anything, then he didn't know about it, but she couldn't do that, she had more important things to worry about right now.</p><br><br><p>Rising slowly, feeling a muffled ache run through her body, Katrin glanced at the Lands of the Lone Serpent.</p><br><p>The place had changed drastically during the Eclipse, high snow covered the black sand, four ice towers letting out a frosty mist while massive chains swayed slightly in the powerful gusts of wind.</p><br><p>Hundreds of corpses covered the battlefield, but most of them were no longer visible, other monsters either ate them to replenish some energy or the snow carefully hid them from this cruel world.</p><br><p>The blue and white flashes continued to fight close to the northern wall, though the area of their battlefield was getting larger by the second. The terrain around the Dormant Lord and the Blind Sinner became a dead zone, none of the monsters dared to come close to them.</p><br><p>Much farther away, not far from one of the ice towers, a scalding light occasionally collided with green flames.</p><br><p>In an equal struggle, Viron had no trouble gradually wielding the upper hand. The Grim Warro's joyful grin was rapidly fading away, changing to panic and despair.</p><br><p>Viron was unstoppable. No matter what the Grim Warro did or how many other monsters tried to help their leader, Viron would destroy every one of them.</p><br><p>The bright light was destroying them like creatures of darkness, burning their flesh to bare bones in a matter of seconds, then without delay, without even taking a breath, Viron continued to build up the pressure on his enemy.</p><br><p>"Oh... What determination and ferocity, no wonder he's so calm. If he were one or two levels higher he would be able to try his chances against the Dormant Lord."</p><br><p>Impressed by Viron's performance, Katrin slowly turned her head to the south, eager to see how Gnash handled her opponent.</p><br><p>Her fight was very different from what Viron and the Grim Warro were going through. In the north, light destroyed green flames, while in the south, gravity stopped water streams and white shots.</p><br><p>Gnash's serious expression was similar to Viron's, but she was calculating and calm while Viron moved forward, pushing his position with overwhelming power.</p><br><p>She watched carefully what the Essence Silent Droao and its followers were doing, her purple eyes not missing any of the monsters' movements.</p><br><p>Gravity allowed her to slowly build up an advantage, blasting one monster after another under pressure, but if she missed even one attack, she might see a hole in her chest or between her eyes the next moment.</p><br><p>"Good, they're doing a great job." Katrin nodded deeply returning her gaze to the Dormant Lord.</p><br><p>Remembering her humiliating defeat, Katrin bit her lip, her fists tightly clenched and her eyes bloodshot.</p><br><p>After getting a few moments of peace, Katrin realized that there was another reason why she had no way of defeating strong opponents, proof that she wasn't fighting at full strength.</p><br><p>'Fuck... I didn't even enter Resonance. Neither my mind nor my body was willing to go all the way. What kind of victory can I speak of then?'</p><br><p>Taking a few deep breaths, Katrin shook her head.</p><br><p>'No, that's not what I should be thinking about right now. Viron's plan can work, it has to. I can still prove myself, even if it takes a second round and the help of others.'</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Adam's eyes reflected a tall creature four to five meters tall. Its red skin covered the massive muscles quivering on its arms and legs, yet unlike the lean build of the Blind Sinner, this monster's body was large with a dense layer of fat beneath the thick skin.</p><br><p>The only weapons it had besides a massive cleaver with an old rusty blade were its short black nails on its legs and arms, but they were hardly sharp enough to do any damage.</p><br><p>A short but broad neck went to a hairless head, with a large nose, flat ears, and a powerful jaw full of crooked teeth, fangs protruding from under the lips.</p><br><p>Though its eyes were red like the Solitary and Mighty commander's it was not a soulless puppet controlled by vines, this monster was of his own will.</p><br><br><p>Thick drops of blood ran down its torso, from a wide cut caused by a direct hit from the black lightning. If not for the crimson crystal, Adam would surely kill the last guardian with a single attack.</p><br><p>Slowly, the monster pointed his weapon at Adam, the broad cleaver could cut him in two with one precise slash, no harder than an insect.</p><br><p>Adam stepped forward, holding the needle tightly.</p><br><p>"Who?" he asked wanting to know the name of his latest opponent.</p><br><p>Silvana answered quickly:</p><br><p>'Savage Broako, without further ado, by level he's the strongest you've faced before.'</p><br><br><p>Then, darkness covered Adam's body. There was no fear in his gaze - now he felt that it was not the crimson crystal that was the target of his First Wall.</p>
