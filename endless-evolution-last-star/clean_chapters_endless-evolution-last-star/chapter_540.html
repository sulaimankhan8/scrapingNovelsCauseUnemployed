            <br><p>As technology evolved, so did how people traveled great distances. It was an inevitability of technological advancement.</p><br><p>There were millions of cars and other vehicles in Citadel, there were futuristic options filled with various technologies and old-fashioned and vintage options for old-style car enthusiasts.</p><br><p>But, one thing was almost impossible to come across at Citadel.</p><br><p>Aside from cars, people had long used another means of transportation that couldn't drive itself, it required a live force.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>The muffled sound of hooves hitting the dusty ground rang out, two snow-white horses with gorgeous manes moved forward in sync, pulling a long snowy carriage, pure and innocent, framed in gold with the sign of three pink petals on the door.</p><br><p>Inside the carriage, sat a lonely girl in a long dress, awaiting her fate as a bride, no... as one who would soon be a wife.</p><br><p>Osana's eyes were calm and her face devoid of emotion. From time to time, the carriage shuddered slightly due to the rough road, the wheels spinning rapidly as the coachman must be in front of the palace entrance at a strictly set time.</p><br><p>For the sake of this moment, a lot of training had taken place earlier, without Osana's involvement.</p><br><p>"We're almost there..." Osana muttered in a quiet voice while looking through the window at her family's palace visible in the distance.</p><br><p>Though outwardly unfazed, Osana's fingers dug into her dress, clutching the fabric with force and her legs trembled slightly.</p><br><p>She didn't doubt that she made the right choice, up to this point she did everything in her power, scoring every move perfectly, but... nothing else depended on her.</p><br><p>Her fate was in the hands of another man, no... in the hands of another Phantom.</p><br><br><p>Soon, the carriage stopped, and the coachman jumped from his seat and opened the door for Osana.</p><br><p>"Ms. Osana, your hour has come, it is time for the bride to appear." The man bowed low with a respectful wave of his hand.</p><br><p>Osana silently stepped forward, about to descend the three bronze steps of the carriage.</p><br><p>Six maids in festive attire were already standing in front of the carriage, awaiting her arrival.</p><br><p>Osana took her time, she made one step and looked ahead - at the sun, much of which was gone by now, allowing darkness to fall over the palace.</p><br><p>Tall lampposts illuminated the path Osana had to take to reach the entrance of the palace, bright light coming out of the banquet hall.</p><br><p>"Sure, no need to keep my groom waiting, right? I hope he won't be late..." Osana muttered before stepping out of the carriage.</p><br><p>The coachman cast a slightly bemused look at her without raising his head.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Nirosh Marzo is already in the banquet hall, he came as agreed, on schedule. He has met the guests and is waiting for you at the golden arch, along with the officiant." The man replied, not understanding why Osana thought her groom hadn't arrived yet.</p><br><p>Osana waved her hand slightly, heading forward.</p><br><p>The maids obediently followed her, going to lead her to the palace.</p><br><p>Many gazes were directed at Osana, as the guests noticed her arrival when they saw the carriage and the two white horses in the distance.</p><br><p>But, for Osana, even a thousand stares was not a problem.</p><br><p>In fact, out of all of them, it was important for her to see only one...</p><br><br><p>Step. Step. Step. Step.</p><br><p>The bride disappeared behind the palace doors as the last rays of sunlight reached the ground.</p><br><p>Rosalind nodded deeply, rose, and walked toward the guards.</p><br><p>They saw her from a distance but showed no emotion until she got too close.</p><br><p>"If you wish to leave the wedding then do so through the main gate please." The first guard replied, he didn't even look at Rosalind, his gaze was directed forward.</p><br><p>The second guard behaved identically to the first. They knew well how to act in situations like this.</p><br><p>Rosalind nodded slightly, her back was straight, her shoulders broad and her hands behind her back as if she was going to join them and become the third guard.</p><br><p>"Of course I would, but I'm afraid you misunderstand me."</p><br><p>Find exclusive stories on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>The first guard glared at her.</p><br><br><p>Rosalind looked ahead, beyond the black gate.</p><br><p>"I'm not going to leave, I'm here for you to let my guest through." Rosalind held out her hand pointing to a silhouette approaching the gate.</p><br><p>The guards turned around, looking at the young man with black hair and blue eyes dressed in a black and gray outfit of unusual style.</p><br><p>"But... He can do it through the main entrance. Moreover, he must have an invitation!" The second guard quickly replied.</p><br><p>Rosalind narrowed her eyes.</p><br><p>"He is a guest of the Franz Balo. Unfortunately, he was late and didn't make it in time. We don't want anyone else getting the attention only Osana De Rouzet deserves during the bride's entrance, do we?" Rosalind said in a cold voice, showing that it wasn't a question, it was an order.</p><br><p>The second guard was confused, he didn't know what to do and now he had no one to ask for advice.</p><br><br><p>The first guard waved his hand and took a step to the side.</p><br><p>"Members of great families can come to weddings without a direct invitation like Franz and Nelya Balo did, the same goes for their guests. Thus, we have no reason to interfere with you. Moreover, we will have a problem if something or someone interferes with the bride's appearance."</p><br><p>The second guard flinched slightly before repeating the actions of his more experienced fellow.</p><br><p>Rosalind smiled slyly as a satisfied glint passed over her eyes.</p><br><p>"Excellent, always good to see professionals at work."</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the black gate slid open, letting a guest of the Balo Family inside.</p><br><p>Rosalind bowed slightly, greeting him.</p><br><p>"I am pleased to see you, Adam Vinter."</p><br><p>Adam glanced around and let out a resounding wheeze, exhaling a cold vapor.</p><br><p>"Oh, me too. I've been looking forward to this wedding for so long, what a shame I couldn't make it to the start, but..."</p><br><p>Adam looked at the palace that was quite close.</p><br><p>"I've made it to the main act, I don't care about the rest."</p><br><br><p>A powerful wind rushed through the tall trees, rippling the leaves, reaching Adam, and ruffling his hair, making the black tips sway in front of his deep ocean eyes, filled with something secret and desirable due to his long wait.</p>
