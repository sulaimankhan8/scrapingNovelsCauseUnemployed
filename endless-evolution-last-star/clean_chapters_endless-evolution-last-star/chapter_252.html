            <br><p>Adam already knew what Magnus's dangerous but effective method of treatment was. With this method, the Phantom could grow a new limb or even an organ.</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that there was another safer method that Lirla offered, as well, such a treatment was only necessary in exceptional cases.</p><br><p>Usually, even if a Phantom lost an arm or leg, the military or Harvesters would soon take the lost limb from the battlefield, allowing the doctors to reattach it to the body.</p><br><p>Even if the arm was severely damaged, with chunks of flesh torn off or beginning to rot, it was no problem for the doctors working with the Phantoms.</p><br><p>Thus, cases when a Phantom lost a limb completely and needed a new one were quite rare.</p><br><p>Most of the time, it was a consequence of a serious and traumatic battle, so most of the Phantoms in this situation did not mind waiting for the doctors to create a new arm and take a break from Dead Lands.</p><br><p>Also, although Magnus had already done his method with many Phantoms, data was still scarce. Each time, the wounds, Phantoms, and monsters were different.</p><br><p>However, now he had a unique opportunity to see because a Phantom like Adam hadn't been in Magnus's experiment yet.</p><br><p>'Hehehe, not only will I finally be able to use Bladeclaw Beast, but bringing him to Red Feast was not just a curiosity, but also had a real effect thanks to Thunder Demon's meat! Furthermore... Adam himself is not like the other Phantoms... Well, all of the slum Phantoms are similar in some way, it's a pity they're quite a few.' Magnus internally pondered, ignoring his sly smirk.</p><br><p>"Well, shall we get started then?" Adam suggested with a slight wave of his hand.</p><br><br><p>"Sure. However, don't forget, you must not completely destroy Bladeclaw Beast, for then his heart will be lost as well."</p><br><br><p>Adam tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>"By the way, why couldn't you just prepare Bladeclaw Beast's heart for me? I'm sure he's been captured and locked up in this lab by Phantoms much stronger than me."</p><br><p>Magnus chuckled evilly.</p><br><p>"Hah, Adam, have you forgotten that this is no ordinary monster? Even if one piece of flesh remains, it will turn into a huge monster after a while. Bladeclaw Beast, like any regenerative monster, can do that." Magnus smiled ironically.</p><br><p>Adam rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p><br><p>"I see... So I need to defeat Bladeclaw Beast, but the heart must remain intact, then I must eat it, suppress the monster's genes, and use regenerative energy to rebuild my arm."</p><br><p>"Bingo!" Magnus snapped his fingers, pointing at Adam with a confident smirk.</p><br><p>"By the way, before we get started. You said that Bladeclaw Beast is the strongest among regenerative monsters in Purple Threat Level. So... what place in the rankings does he hold?"</p><br><p>Adam was ready to fight any opponent, but he had to eat the monster, which made it difficult to do so without his right arm.</p><br><p>This time it was Silvana who answered:</p><br><p>"This is the Prime Bladeclaw Beast, so he is ranked Top-7 among all Purple Threat Level Monsters."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply but did not reply to anything. Even if he defeated Thunder Demon, it didn't mean that all monsters weaker than Thunder Demon were now feeble to him. Especially, since Bladeclaw Beast had incredible regeneration.</p><br><br><p>"Alright, then come inside. I'll tell you what to do as needed to make the treatment a success."</p><br><p>Adam nodded heading towards the exit of the room. He stopped in the doorway and glanced at Magnus, then at Nessa and Silvana.</p><br><p>"Hey... Aren't you afraid I'll lose, and Bladeclaw Beast will kill you?" Adam asked seriously.</p><br><p>In response, Magnus only shrugged nonchalantly, throwing his feet up on the table in a relaxed manner.</p><br><p>"Well, first of all, this 'glass' is strong enough to protect us. Secondly... You're not going to lose, are you?" Magnus narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>"Of course not. I came here to heal my arm, not to lose." Adam said confidently, stepping forward.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the door behind him closed, and two trapdoors opened in the floor - one in the center of the hall, wide and massive, the other in the distance, quite small.</p><br><p>Soon, Bladeclaw Beast appeared, trapped in a cage made of the same glass that protected Magnus. The monster was already ready to fight but didn't try to get out of its cage, as it knew it was useless.</p><br><p>Adam nodded and turned around, toward the second trapdoor. Strangely enough, it was a table with a white tablecloth, a lone plate along with a fork and knife, as if for a simple meal.</p><br><p>"Tsk. Is he serious?" Adam shook his head, as his eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>Around Adam's left hand silver threads wove themselves together, transforming into a gauntlet with sharp claws.</p><br><p>There was another difficulty in Adam's case - he could only use his Nexus in a limited way. He had one arm and therefore - one glove. However, that was enough to use the Second Trait.</p><br><p>"Fine, it's time to begin. I hope you eat his heart with as much pleasure as Thunder Demon's meat." Magnus smirked before pressing the button and releasing Bladeclaw Beast.</p><br><p>Bladeclaw Beast waited obediently for the protective glass to lower. The monster realized that there was no hurry, either he would kill Adam and try to escape from here, or he would die.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Bladeclaw Beast actually had a chance to escape from the Citadel, because the Miracle Observatory was located in the slum area next to the walls.</p><br><p>All Bladeclaw Beast had to do was kill Adam, break through the walls, and find a crack to escape into the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>"Attack. Unlike me, you have a whole six arms, so to speak." Adam uttered, pointing his silver claw at Bladeclaw Beast, glaring at the monster's four outgrowths and his two long paws.</p><br><p>Bladeclaw Beast snorted unhappily as his four outgrowths came into motion, pointing their sharp tips straight towards Adam's chest.</p><br><br><p>Adam darted forward, like a shadow disappearing from one place and almost instantly appearing in another. At least, that's how it seemed to Nessa and Silvana.</p><br><p>Then, before Bladeclaw Beast could realize anything, a stream of blood rushed from the monster's chest as something deeply pierced it.</p><br><p>Bladeclaw Beast's four eyes quickly darted downward, looking at Adam's silver gauntlet half submerged in the monster's chest.</p><br><p>"Well, at least your defenses are negligible." Adam said calmly before pulling back his hand and ripping Bladeclaw Beast's heart right out of the monster's chest.</p><br><p>Perhaps if a mere human or inexperienced Phantom had been watching Adam's fight, they would have thought that Adam had already won, but Bladeclaw Beast was not the kind of opponent that such wounds were effective on.</p><br><br><p>Immediately, Bladeclaw Beast swung his long claws, but Adam stepped back in time as the claws swept right before his eyes.</p><br><p>Then, Adam cast a glance at the monster's chest - the hole was beginning to heal quickly with chunks of flesh, but... something confused Adam.</p><br><p>"Wait...? He didn't start repairing his heart?" Adam was puzzled. Bladeclaw Beast's heart was still alive, it was literally beating in Adam's hand.</p><br><br><p>"It's an unnecessary waste of energy for him, it makes him a little weaker, but I'd say it's the right move."</p><br><p>"I see... Well, we all realize this fight is going to end one way." Adam pointed his bloody claw at Bladeclaw Beast.</p><br>
