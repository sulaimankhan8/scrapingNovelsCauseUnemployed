            <br><p>Adam took a long look at his potential opponent. Neither of them was in a hurry to act, yet they were both ready for battle.
</p><br><p>"Well, well... You look much more serious, but..."
</p><br><p>His eyes quickly darted toward the nearest tower. The creatures were still in their places, which was not surprising because unlike them, Adam’s opponent had two, glowing blue eyes.
</p><br><p>Then, Adam turned back to his opponent, but the monster was no longer on the wall. This didn’t surprise Adam, he felt that his opponent was in the arena.
</p><br><p>"Hmm... I take it you’re not my only problem, right?" Adam frowned examining the tall monster.
</p><br><p>Silvana’s voice rang out quickly in his ears:
</p><br><p>’This is the Solitary Commander. Like the monsters, before it is Mid Yellow Threat level, however, it is much stronger than the Dark Watchers, and even more so, it doesn’t compare to Shadow Walkers.’
</p><br><p>From his vast experience, Adam sensed something strange in Silvana’s tone.
</p><br><p>"Is something wrong?" Adam raised an eyebrow.
</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip.
</p><br><p>’Yes... To be honest, I thought you would meet the Solitary Commander much later, I expected it to be your final monster to destroy the First Wall.’
</p><br><p>It seemed that Silvana was underestimating Adam, but he knew that was not the case. To him, it was an indication of how strong the Solitary Commander was that Silvana honored him with such praise.
</p><br><br><p>The long tail lashed the air like a whip before darting to the side, maintaining its fast, destructive pace.
</p><br><p>The Solitary Commander was not much different in height from the Dark Watchers, in fact, the Solitary Commander seemed a bit smaller. His build was more suited for speed and mobility than pure strength and brute force.
</p><br><p>The crimson armor of curved plates covered the Solitary Commander’s body tightly, accentuating every curve and muscle, a masterpiece of the blacksmith, unlike the rough, heavy armor of the Dark Watchers.
</p><br><p>Each long, lean arm bore five sharp claws, reflecting the violet light of the torches, the glint traveling lower to the legs, fully protected on all sides.
</p><br><p>On the Solitary Commander’s chest, the density of the armor increased several times over, plates like petals intertwined with each other, forming an unusual bud in the center. The momentum of any attack hitting the bud would spread across hundreds of plates, losing most of its power before reaching the Solitary Commander.
</p><br><p>Unlike the Dark Watchers who resembled guards with their heavy armor and helmets, the Solitary Commander was like a demon.
</p><br><p>From his head came two black horns pointing forward, crimson plates covering their base disappearing in fine ripples. Its eyes looked like human’s, except they glowed as lanterns full of energy.
</p><br><br><p>Adam stretched his shoulder before adopting a fighting stance.
</p><br><p>"Agh, I have no other choice anyway. I’ve made my decision."
</p><br><p>His eyes narrowed, staring intently at the Solitary Commander who only continued to beat the air with his tail.
</p><br><p>However, before Adam could do anything, a purple sphere floated between them. The large eye glared at Adam and the Solitary Commander.
</p><br><p>Then, the eye shone brightly again, this time releasing not just a beam of light but a dense bolt of lightning that crashed into the central circular slab.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The slab shuddered, absorbing the power before shattering into tiny fragments as the seal was finally broken.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, a large coffin of black stone appeared, consuming all light.
</p><br><p>The purple sphere flew upwards so as not to interfere with the fighters, and also directed a beam of light towards the Solitary Commander.
</p><br><p>That was enough for the monster to spring into action. He extended his right arm forward, causing the coffin frame to shudder.
</p><br><p>Moving along the slabs, the coffin appeared in front of the Solitary Commander.
</p><br><p>With a quick movement, the Solitary Commander tossed aside the top lid before pulling out the weapon.
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes went wide for a moment, slight consternation mixed with curiosity.
</p><br><p>A long spear with a thick black hilt found itself in the Solitary Commander’s tight grip. The spear had an unnaturally long crimson blade running from the center of the hilt to the tip, the blade twisted like a powerful whirlwind ready to tear down everything in its path.
</p><br><br><p>The Solitary Commander swung the spear through the air, but... something confused him. It wasn’t the spear given to him by the fortress, it was the fact that his long claws were not suitable for holding it.
</p><br><p>The monster’s gaze traveled downward, his blue eyes staring intently at his five sharp claws.
</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, the Solitary Commander tossed the spear into his other hand and swung his new weapon, cutting the claws on his right hand as short as possible.
</p><br><p>A slight shiver ran through Adam’s body. An opponent with such a strong will, devoid of doubt and full of determination was not someone he wanted to face so soon.
</p><br><p>’Damn... And he’s not my last monster? It’s not even the strongest monster of the fortress. Moreover, what kind of spear is that? Am I fighting for it, or is there another reward waiting for me if I win?’
</p><br><p>Adam realized that he had to get something in return if he could prevail. He gave up a few runes to fight an opponent who got an amplification from the fortress.
</p><br><p>That is to say, Adam chose an increased difficulty level instead of just picking up a nice bonus and moving on.
</p><br><p>’Hah, the External Artifact here is on a completely different level than in Fume Cathedral. I mean, the power that the Plague Reaper received from Fume Throne was impressive. If not for his pride, it would be enough to bury us there.’
</p><br><p>Adam quickly looked around with a bitter smile.
</p><br><p>’But... That artifact. Damn, it’s created a whole system around it with its own rules, arenas, and even rewards. I wonder what it looks like and... where is it located?’
</p><br><p>Crackle. Find exclusive stories on NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>With a sharp blow of his fist, the Solitary Commander smashed the coffin into debris, taking a wide step forward straight towards Adam.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, more and more shadows began to appear around the square, spectacle-hungry onlookers, the crowd eager to see what they were incapable of.</p>
