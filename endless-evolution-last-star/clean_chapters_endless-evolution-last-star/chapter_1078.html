The Phantoms did not often appear at the Dark Shore, or rather those Phantoms that could be encountered by the Red Threat Level monsters, such as the trio in front of Adam, to avoid dying in the first five seconds.</p><br><p>From time to time, the Second Rank Phantoms would visit the Dark Shore. After all, this was their battlefield, where enemies of their level were found. Only they could perform tasks of such a tier, all to protect the Citadel and humanity.</p><br><p>Well, the Elders also had a job to do when the K4-Phantoms came to the Dark Shore. It didn’t happen very often, but it wasn’t scarce.</p><br><br><br><p>A Phantom of that level simply couldn’t cross the far regions of the Wild Lands, where there were monsters too strong for the K3-Phantoms.</p><br><p>The K4-Phantoms and the Second Rank Phantoms never took the K3-Phantoms to the Dark Shore. It was too dangerous, and the might of the K3-Phantoms was insignificant.</p><br><p>What happened to Adam was one of the rare situations where a Phantom like him could end up at the Dark Shore.</p><br><p>In a way, the young wing monsters were lucky. They had a unique opportunity to fight against such a special Phantom.</p><br><p>Well, only if they can survive this encounter.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward calmly, his blue eyes picking out his first target.</p><br><p>Sure, he had to hurry, but he couldn’t just turn around and set his back to the attack of the three monsters.</p><br><p>He had to deal with them first, only then would he be able to move on.</p><br><p>“Tsk.” The girl snorted. “Your aura may be strong, but that doesn’t mean you alone can handle the three of us!”</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, all three of them prepared to fight. Adam and they were about to jerk out of their seats to clash.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, light footsteps echoed from outside.</p><br><p>Everyone turned around only to see a girl with blue eyes and long black hair. Her face was devoid of emotion except for mild curiosity.</p><br><br><p>Despite the start of a fierce battle, she touched her bottom lip, tilting her head in a perplexed manner.</p><br><p>“What’s going on here?”</p><br><p>Adam frowned heavily.</p><br><p>He knew that if he used one of his trump cards, he could probably defeat three strong wing monsters without much trouble. But… a 1 vs. 4 fight could be a problem.</p><br><p>‘More than that.’ Adam instinctively took a step back. ‘What’s wrong with her? Her aura isn’t like the others. Is she stronger or weaker than they are? Why can’t I figure it out?’</p><br><p>“L-Lexa…?” The girl with the lightning flinched. “What are you doing here?”</p><br><p>Lexa blinked her large eyes several times.</p><br><p>“Agh? Isn’t it obvious? I was just like you, looking for that Phantom.” She turned to Adam. “Your name is Adam, right?”</p><br><p>There was nothing to do, Adam nodded.</p><br><p>For a moment, he noticed Lexa’s eyes darting to his needles. It was enough for her to realize his fighting potential.</p><br><p>‘Adam, this girl is dangerous.’ Silvana’s voice boomed in his mind. ‘You need to kill her first. I think one or two swings of the second needle will be enough. If need be, I can give you energy or take over your wound.’</p><br><p>At this time, the shocked trio looked at each other.</p><br><p>The flame guy scratched the back of his head. “Well, that wasn’t part of our plans, but… Lexa, if you want, you can join us.”</p><br><p>“And? What happens then?” She asked with a detached look.</p><br><p>A skinny young man stepped forward with an irritated wave of his hand.</p><br><p>“What do you mean, Lexa? We’ll capture him, force him to lead us to the Twilight Crystal, and then kill him. After that, we’ll decide how to absorb the Twilight Crystal! The energy in such a rare treasure is definitely enough for all of us!”</p><br><p>The girl and the broad-shouldered guy nodded in agreement. Circumstances had changed, but they were willing to accept these terms.</p><br><p>However… Lexa didn’t look at all interested in absorbing the Twilight Crystal.</p><br><p>Only Adam could see that. He sensed that, unlike the rest of the wing monsters, she had a different goal.</p><br><p>“No. I’m not interested in those terms.”</p><br><p>Before the trio could respond, claws covered her hand as her wings shuddered in green flame.</p><br><p>In a lightning-fast, emerald flash, she swept through the skinny guy, ending up behind him.</p><br><br><p>Her wings opened wide, splashing dark drops of blood under the young man’s pale face.</p><br><p>“What…?” He wheezed, cold hands touching his chest where one crucial part was missing.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Lexa’s eyes lowered, looking at the still-beating heart in her hand.</p><br><p>“NO! Lexa! Fuck! Don’t do that!” the lightning girl exclaimed in horror.</p><br><br><p>Lexa crushed the young man’s heart, ending the life of a talented monster who would soon become one of the Elders.</p><br><p>A white flash erupted to the side as Adam created the lesser path with a sweep of the second needle.</p><br><p>He didn’t know why Lexa had done it or what her motives were, but she gave him a unique opportunity that he simply couldn’t waste.</p><br><p>A surge of blood rushed from the girl’s right shoulder as Adam turned and swung the first needle. The broad blade, carrying darkness behind it, sliced the girl apart, never letting her show the power of his lightning.</p><br><p>In the end, the only one left among them was the flame guy, who didn’t have time to adapt to the situation. He couldn’t put his thoughts in order, watching as the two corpses of his friends slowly fell to the bottom of the underground gorge.</p><br><p>The last thing he saw was a purple wave running down Adam’s body. His fingers left a white line in the air, with a purple tint.</p><br><br><p>A black line ran vertically down the flaming guy’s body, splitting his powerful frame in two.</p><br><p>Then, Lexa and Adam locked gazes.</p><br><p>He was ready for a fight. She wasn’t his ally, he realized that.</p><br><p>“Why?” Adam asked with complete seriousness.</p><br><p>Lexa’s corners of her lips curved upward as a flame of madness appeared in her eyes.</p><br><p>“It’s a simple question, because… I don’t want to absorb the Twilight Crystal.”</p><br><br><p>“I only have one wish.”</p>
