            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1323: First Stage and Risks</strong></p><br><p>Usually, to even begin rebuilding the Energy Axis, it was necessary to spend a long period of time on energy control.</p><br><p>This led to Phantom learning to use his energy better and more efficiently, which meant that the pressure exerted on him by his own power became less.</p><br><p>If we compare this situation to a dam, Phantom was no longer afraid of the great flow and gradually opened one gate after another, carefully controlling the pressure.</p><br><p>However, there was another way to rebuild the Energy Axis—simply make it stronger.</p><br><p>If the flow of water were too powerful, the dam could be made much stronger if the necessary resources were available. If the electrical discharge was too strong, the wire could be made thicker, or a material with the least losses could be used.</p><br><p>It was quite difficult to do, but possible, because, as with every other aspect, to achieve this, the Phantoms had to go through a deadly, dangerous situation.</p><br><p>That is why it was a rebuilding of the Energy Axis, not a correction or disclosure.</p><br><p>Now, the front part of Adam’s Energy Axis was under too much pressure.</p><br><p>When Adam tried to summon the Dual Demon Sword, the energy he used for this was quickly lost among the multitude of threads, and only the tips shone for a few seconds.</p><br><p>But Narica’s energy, directed towards his body and requiring purification because it was foreign energy, was a task of a completely different level.</p><br><p>The Energy Axis, like wires, simply overheated from the strain, and their only salvation was to merge together, one thread after another, until they reached the main one, which was the basis of the Energy Axis—the straight line from which many threads emanated.</p><br><p>“Gha! Gha! Gha!” Adam coughed loudly, leaving bloody spots on the ground, but despite his obvious severe internal injuries, his aura slowly grew.</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Narica, causing her skin to break out in goose bumps; she hadn’t felt anything like this in a long time.</p><br><p>The young man in front of her was dying and becoming stronger at the same time, which delayed his death, because with each new flow of energy that now freely flowed through the front of the Energy Axis, his body became stronger and, to some extent, healed.</p><br><p>Only a minute later did Adam finally fall to the ground covered in bloodstains, but there was no trace of pain on his face, only a silly but satisfied smile.</p><br><br><p>A gust of wind swept through the peaks, heading towards them and ruffling Narica’s platinum hair in front of her wide-open blue eyes.</p><br><p>Now, she deeply regretted having to stay at the mill and missing the fight between Adam and Ureyn.</p><br><p>‘This young man, shit… No wonder he has such power at such a young age. But, if I did that every time I was in a risky situation, I would have died more than a hundred times already!’ She exclaimed inwardly.</p><br><p>Then, Narica remained in her spot, puzzled.</p><br><p>Norax’s order was simple — beat Adam half to death.</p><br><p>Although Narica had only made three attacks, her job was done. All Adam was capable of now was lying on the ground and breathing with difficulty.</p><br><p>Only after ten minutes did she shake her head and move forward, deciding to see if he was okay.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Adam rolled from his back onto his stomach and, digging his nails into the ground, slowly got up.</p><br><p>“Agh… Damn, that was more dangerous than I expected,” Adam said, impressed, but clearly not understanding how critical the situation really was.</p><br><p>Narica stopped, staring at Adam as if he were a ghost.</p><br><p>“Hmm? Is something wrong?” he asked, scratching his cheek.</p><br><br><p>“Adam… I have a question for you. May I ask it?”</p><br><br><p>Narica clenched her hands into fists, leaving bloody crescents on her palms.</p><br><p>“How are you still alive? I know people like you, both humans and monsters. You die, quickly and brutally, all of you! Because it’s impossible to act like that constantly and somehow survive every time!”</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Before Adam had time to think of an answer, a cloud of darkness appeared from the side as Norax’s silhouette came into view.</p><br><p>“Hahaha! Narica, I always thought you were a smart woman!” Norax laughed out loud.</p><br><p>“S-Sir!” She flinched, about to kneel, but Norax stopped her with a wave of his hand.</p><br><p>Then, he pointed at Adam, whose aura continued to grow.</p><br><p>“It’s quite simple, Narica. Thousands of reckless warriors like Adam die so that only one survives in the end. Even if the risk is enormous and victory seems impossible, there will always be someone who will do it despite the odds being stacked against them.”</p><br><p>Narica’s lips trembled. “But, sir… Isn’t that an exception? Such success cannot be repeated constantly.”</p><br><p>In response, Norax spread his arms wide.</p><br><p>“I didn’t make the rules.”</p><br><p>In an instant, his voice grew lower as his gaze turned away from the Blighted Scar Lands. Hundreds of kilometers in that direction was the great structure that was the stronghold of all humanity—the Citadel.</p><br><p>“But someone else. The number of times Damien should have died in his lifetime is greater than the stars in the sky, and what was the result?”</p><br><p>Narica couldn’t answer, her face had turned pale. Her reaction was similar to Gareyna’s. For Adam, she was an invincible opponent, but not for Damien, who could destroy her hundred-year history with a simple wave of his hand.</p><br><p>“What’s more…” Norax’s gaze darkened.</p><br><p>Suddenly, his expression changed, and a broad smile spread across his face.</p><br><p>“I’m just as foolish as Adam! Hahaha!”</p><br><p>Narica sighed with relief. After many years of serving Norax, she knew that he could be terrifying when angry, and his voice was sometimes the first sign of this.</p><br><p>“I see, sir, I think the thing is that I can’t take all the risks like you or Adam do.”</p><br><p>“There’s nothing to be ashamed of, everyone has their own path. Not all the High Lords act the same.”</p><br><p>He waved his hand carelessly and turned to Adam.</p><br><p>“So, Adam, I see you’ve already taken your first step. You’ve rebuilt the beginning of your Energy Axis, but this is only the beginning. Are you ready for the next stage?”</p><br><br><p>“Do I have a choice?”</p><br><br>
