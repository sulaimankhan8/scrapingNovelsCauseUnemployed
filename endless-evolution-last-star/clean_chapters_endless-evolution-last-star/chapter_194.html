            <br><p>What was the main mission of the Phantoms - to kill monsters, right?</p><br><p>Well, that was something everyone could probably agree on. In that case, what was Adam doing now? Why, instead of fighting the three Crown Monsters and killing them, he was telling them to leave?</p><br><p>All of these questions Silvana was asking herself right now as she silently watched the situation unfold.</p><br><p>The Harpy Assassins looked at each other in puzzlement.</p><br><p>They knew what Adam was talking about because they were Crown Types and smart enough to do so. They didn't believe his words, but when Adam walked past them, heading towards the edge of the Iron Beacon, the monsters realized he was serious.</p><br><p>Without delay, they picked up their badly wounded fellow and quickly flew away, not wanting to test how strong Adam's patience was.</p><br><p>'What... What was that?' Silvana asked after a few seconds as the Harpy Assassins disappeared from their sight.</p><br><p>"Do you mind?" Adam asked nonchalantly, watching the developing battle from below.</p><br><p>'I can't be against your decisions, but I'm just curious.' Silvana replied confidently.</p><br><p>Adam's gaze traveled forward for a while as he muttered, "I'm just thinking about what I want at the moment."</p><br><br><p>"Should I have killed them? Yes, that's my job as a Phantom. However... should I do what I'm obligated to do or what I want to do?" Adam asked a seemingly rhetorical question.</p><br><p>'What you want...?' Silvana was confused.</p><br><br><p>"They're not particularly strong, but three Crown Type at once will hurt me and make me use abilities. I don't need that, considering I'm going to fight an Essence Monster. Moreover, they're durable, and I'd spend a lot of time on this fight." Adam directed his gaze to the Light Rain squad.</p><br><p>"What I want to do now is to watch them fight because I'm interested. The strong can do what they want, can't they?" Adam said, pointing to the cardinal rule of the Dark Order.</p><br><p>Silvana didn't answer, her gaze only grew deeper. In fact, Adam hadn't done anything selfish, after all, his task was to kill the dangerous Essence Monster. In that case, it was unsafe to waste energy fighting other monsters.</p><br><p>However, the main reason why he let the Assassin Harpies go was because he wanted to watch another squad fight.</p><br><p>Sometimes, one person's wish could decide the fate of millions.</p><br><p>"Great! He's seriously weakened! I'll use my Nexus, and you guys finish it off!" Iren belligerently exclaimed before her sword trembled again.</p><br><p>Four purple spheres appeared around Firebreathing Trinadon, hovering several meters above the ground. Each of the spheres, actively trembled, increasing the pressure on the inner region.</p><br><p>Thus, the Firebreathing Trinadon in the center was immediately nailed to the ground. The monster couldn't move any of its limbs, and the metal plates seemed ready to fly off its body.</p><br><p>'Unbelievable...' Romeo inwardly muttered with awe, looking at Iren, he clearly considered her as a superior being compared to the rest.</p><br><p>"Alright! We're going to get this done now! Romeo, help!" The axe-wielding youth exclaimed before his entire body was covered in flames, and he turned into a fire beam - approaching the Firebreathing Trinadon at great speed.</p><br><p>Their squad had the right abilities to fight against an opponent like Firebreathing Trinadon. Iren could hold the monster down, Romeo could significantly cool the metal, and the axe-wielding youth could cause a drastic temperature difference with his flames.</p><br><p>Thus, considering his highest physical power among the squad, the axe-wielding young man could destroy Firebreathing Trinadon in a single successful attack.</p><br><p>However... the monster also realized this. The Light Rain squad had made one critical mistake - they had forgotten that their opponent's main weapons weren't spinning saws or sharp long claws. There was a reason why this monster had that name.</p><br><br><p>Firebreathing Trinadon started to make a strange metallic cracking sound, it seemed like it was all about the iron plates breaking due to gravity, but... that wasn't the case.</p><br><p>Adam's cold eyes watched the Light Rain squad intently, it seemed that his eyes reflected what was going to happen in a few seconds. He was fully confident that the Light Rain squad wouldn't be able to defeat such a strong monster.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The monster's entire body turned bright red from the heat that accumulated inside, and before the axe-wielding young man could attack, Firebreathing Trinadon's eyes flashed.</p><br><p>At the same moment, from all the gaps and especially from the monster's head, came out deadly streams of fire - in an instant, turning Romeo's icy arrows into water, then vaporizing into steam.</p><br><p>'Agh...?' The axe-wielding young man's eyes went wide when a wave of monster fire easily swept his flames, causing him to experience heat and soon severe pain.</p><br><p>"Look out!" The man with the shield exclaimed, standing in front of everyone else except the axe-wielding young man. His shield shone brightly, creating a barrier of golden light in front of them.</p><br><p>Then, the girl with the staff used her Order, summoning dozens of water bubbles, each capable of both, defending against attacks and healing deep wounds.</p><br><p>However... could it help against the attack of one of the strongest monsters of the Purple Threat Level?</p><br><p>As the flames collided with the barrier and water spheres, the barrier shattered into small shards, and the water instantly turned into vapor.</p><br><p>"Romeo!" Iren exclaimed, realizing that he was the only one who could help them now.</p><br><p>Romeo flinched, guiding his hand forward and creating ice crystals above him. At his will, they headed forward, only slightly weakening the overall power of the flames.</p><br><p>Thus, half a minute later, the entire area was covered in thick vapor, only the sharp peaks of iron buildings as well as the flaming hearth from Firebreathing Trinadon were visible.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..." Iren, Romeo, and the others were breathing heavily, they could withstand this attack thanks to their combined efforts, but they had taken serious damage, every single one of them.</p><br><p>Burns covered their bodies, but overall, they were fine. These wounds were minor, especially compared to what could actually happen to them after such an attack.</p><br><p>"Shit... That was stronger than I expected..." The young man with the axe muttered, knocking the dust off of himself. He managed to stay unharmed, but the monster's flames completely consumed his attack.</p><br><p>Iren's gaze became sharper as she stared at the monster.</p><br><p>"Our plan failed, but it's alright. Firebreathing Trinadon will need time to use such a powerful attack again. We can take advantage of that and win!" Iren uttered like a knight, raising the morale of her team.</p><br><p>"Yes. You're right!" Romeo exclaimed happily, clenching his fist confidently.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Firebreathing Trinadon began to tremble, the gears inside his body turning up the overall heat, causing red-hot steam to escape.</p><br><p>The four circular saws lit up with scarlet flames, becoming blades capable of carrying only fiery death as a harbinger from hell.</p><br><p>Iren gulped as the Firebreathing Trinadon stepped forward, leaving a black trail on the ground as if from burnt coals.</p><br><p>Adam sighed, shaking his head slightly.</p><br><p>"Well... Looks like I'll have to help them out. Why would they hunt a monster if even the five of them can't defeat it?" Adam muttered as his eyes shone.</p>
