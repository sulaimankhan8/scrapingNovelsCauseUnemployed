            <br><p>It was about twelve hours before Nessa woke up on top of the Miracle Observatory:</p><br><p>"Grh..." Adam exhaled the hot vapor slowly drifting in front of him.</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam lost his balance, his legs struggling to hold him up, but soon he was able to recover and stand up confidently.</p><br><p>At the same time, the swollen veins spreading throughout his body were quickly calming down, returning to normal.</p><br><p>"Damn... I probably shouldn't feel so relieved, considering what I did, but..." Adam muttered, looking at Nessa lying on the ground, "It's already happened."</p><br><p>Slowly, Nessa's hair shortened, as did her nails and veins. They were both completely exhausted, but Adam was conscious, while Nessa would need serious treatment to come to her senses soon.</p><br><br><p>Silvana came downstairs, quickly running up to Adam. Although she no longer let her anxiety interfere with their missions, she was still worried about him, especially when he was badly injured.</p><br><p>"Adam... are you okay? When Nessa's foot came down on your head, I thought you would need to spend weeks in the medical department again." Silvana said with a serious stare, yet she clenched her fists tightly, keeping her emotions.</p><br><p>"Yeah... Something like that." Adam nodded with a bitter smile, "That's when I actually got scared, though. If you don't count Thunder Demon, Nessa was the strongest one I fought."</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Nessa, then his gaze grew darker.</p><br><p>"That said... It wasn't my hardest fight. Even though she's stronger than Steel Knight, I didn't feel like our fight mattered to me." Adam frowned slightly.</p><br><p>Nessa was a hybrid, but fighting against her was like fighting against a Crown Monster. It was harder than against North Keeper, but it certainly couldn't compare to Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>"You're absolutely right."</p><br><p>Magnus's authority voice suddenly rang out. Unlike Silvana who hurriedly came to Adam, Magnus was pacing slowly and serenely.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow with interest.</p><br><p>"If in your fight against Thunder Demon, you were the protagonist, then here, the role of the protagonist was Nessa's. You could say that for her, you were the Thunder Demon who allowed her to become stronger. The only difference is that she lost." Magnus shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>He knew how to use this situation to his advantage, whether Nessa would win or lose, he could find the right words for each option.</p><br><p>"Well, I guess you're right. In this fight, I just quenched my desire for battle. It was a useful experience though. When Nessa gets even stronger, we'll need to fight again." Adam smirked, looking at his wounds.</p><br><p>He hadn't gained any new abilities or any growth in his Evolution Tree after his victory, but, it had been a valuable experience that might come in handy in the future. Nessa was the first opponent who was so vastly superior to him physically.</p><br><p>"But, Magnus, never forget something." Adam said seriously.</p><br><p>Magnus raised an eyebrow in puzzlement.</p><br><p>Adam smiled broadly, poking himself in the chest.</p><br><p>"In my story, I'm the main character. If I am not there, then I can't see my story continue. So there can be no one more important than me from my point of view." Adam's eyes sparkled with obvious enthusiasm.</p><br><p>Silvana's mouth opened slightly as her cheeks flushed. Never before had she seen such a bright, almost blinding confidence emanating from Adam.</p><br><p>"Hahahahahahahahahaha!" Magnus laughed evilly, keeping his hands in the pockets of his crimson coat.</p><br><p>"Well... You're right to an extent, but it just shows that there's quite a bit of narcissism and selfishness in you because you're not joking, you're serious." Magnus smirked slyly, "Hah, I'm not judging though, because I'm the same type."</p><br><p>Then, Magnus walked over to Nessa, rolled her over onto her back, and gently caressed her cheek.</p><br><p>"If I wasn't a selfish man pursuing my own goals, she would never have come into this world. Who knows what would be with me now if it weren't for this beautiful miracle - the only creature I care about." Magnus uttered earnestly.</p><br><p>Nessa had never heard him say such words, for despite his personality, Magnus was a bit embarrassed about such things. However... Silvana was ready.</p><br><p>All the while, she was recording Magnus's voice with her phone in her pocket.</p><br><p>Soon, when Nessa woke up, she would have that recording and it would be the best gift of all for her.</p><br><p>"Mr. Magnus, do you think Nessa can get even stronger?" Silvana asked.</p><br><p>Magnus nodded, throwing Nessa onto her back.</p><br><p>"Yeah. Apparently, after the transformation, the energy in her cells went from inactive to active mode. You can't use a muscle to grow your nails, or hair, or change your eye color and pupil in an instant. However, energy is quite capable of it. Come on, follow me. Adam's hurt, too." Magnus waved his hand, stepping forward at a leisurely pace.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana looked over at each other.</p><br><p>"Do you need help?" Silvana asked uncertainly.</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Magnus, then at Silvana, and nodded with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Yeah, that would be good." Adam nodded, allowing Silvana to throw his arm over her shoulder.</p><br><p>In fact, Adam could easily go after Magnus himself, but it wasn't about making the way easier, it was about accepting Silvana's offer and not turning her down when she wanted to help.</p><br><p>Many people were not capable of learning this simple art even in decades. Sometimes, it was necessary to accept help from others to improve the overall situation.</p><br><br><p>Nessa was floating in a special pod with a red liquid. It was different from all the others that were in the Miracle Observatory. Magnus had created this pod specifically to treat Nessa, in a few hours there would be no trace of her wounds.</p><br><p>Adam was also healed, but he had already come out of a simple pod that cured all of his wounds except for the most serious one, a long cut on his left arm.</p><br><p>It was left after Snow Follower's katana, cut through his silver claws, nearly severing his arm, the blade going deep into the flesh.</p><br><p>"Hey, are you sure you want to keep that scar? Nessa's claws that pierced your stomach won't leave a mark, the wounds are too small, but this cut is really big." Magnus asked nonchalantly, keeping an eye on Nessa's condition.

That scar is the only thing I have left from the fight." Adam said looking at his left arm.</p><br><p>Magnus shrugged his shoulders.</p><br><p>"Suit yourself. Before you go, I have to warn you about something." Magnus said seriously, narrowing his eyes.</p><br><br><p>"You came here, successfully healed your arm using my method, and left with a happy smile on your face. Nothing else happened here, is that clear to you? Not Red Feast, not the battle against Nessa, not the fact that she's a hybrid. None of that you know." Magnus said threateningly.</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"Sure, just let me know when she wants a rematch. I'll be ready." Adam waved his hand heading for the exit.</p><br><p>Magnus turned around:</p><br><p>"What are you going to do next?"</p><br><p>Adam looked up, closed his eyes, and stood before his Evolution Tree, his gaze traveling down to Lock, with three keyholes.</p><br><p>"Well, it's time to get the last component for my First Key."</p>
