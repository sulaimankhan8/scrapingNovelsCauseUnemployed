            <br><p>The Blind Commander refused the challenge he offered himself because he felt a strong threat from Adam.</p><br><p>He didn't know exactly what was going on, but all his instincts were screaming that this shouldn't happen to a creature of Adam's power.</p><br><p>It was a threat to the entire fortress, the Blind Commander clearly understood that, so his goal was to destroy Adam. He expected Adam to explode or transform into some fearsome creature, but the change was entirely different.</p><br><p>A faint smile appeared on Adam's face, the last bits of darkness passing before his calm, peaceful eyes.</p><br><p>The white threads covering his body were quickly disappearing as well as the ember grid in his right eye.</p><br><p>His abilities, his body, and his mind were making room for the new guest who came here with the combined efforts of the Two Walls, the Evolution Tree, and the Desire Star.</p><br><p>The purple and crimson flashes, illuminated Adam's face, partially falling on the Blind Commander, who was ready to attack, the distance between them was only two steps.</p><br><p>"Hey, you don't have to look at me like that. I'm not as dangerous as you think I am."</p><br><p>His calm words did not affect the Blind Commander, his cold sword swept towards Adam at high speed without intending to stop for a moment.</p><br><br><p>The palm touched his pale chest, a crimson glow came out from below, aggressive and wild like a beast from the forest waking up after a long sleep.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the Blind Commander didn't have time to react or even notice Adam's movements, though that hadn't been a problem before.</p><br><p>Adam raised his eyes, looking at the shocked Blind Commander.</p><br><p>"You said three strikes, right? Well, get ready to take the first one."</p><br><p>The other monsters inhabiting the fortress were not part of the battle, but they had witnessed what happened at that very moment.</p><br><p>A bright crimson star shone at the top of the spire, bursting out across its boundaries and completely blocking the dense stream of blue fire.</p><br><p>It caught the attention not only of the Dark Watchers or the Shadow Walkers but even of the four creatures lurking in the towers, until then, they only looked beyond, not interested in what was happening inside the walls.</p><br><p>Experience exclusive tales on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the crimson star shrank to the size of a grain, unleashing all of its power into a single target.</p><br><br><p>A thick stream of blood rushed through the tightly knotted torn bandages as the crimson energy ripped chunks of cloth, tearing apart the pale skin.</p><br><p>The impact threw the Blind Commander to the other side of the platform, he wasn't as lucky as Adam as there were no pillars in his path.</p><br><br><p>The ice sword slammed into the platform, leaving a line of ice behind it, slowing the Blind Commander greatly.</p><br><p>He stopped one step away from the abyss, breathing heavily.</p><br><p>Blood was pouring from his mouth, and his stomach looked as if a bomb had exploded nearby, ripping his flesh apart.</p><br><p>Yet, a few deep breaths were all that was needed for the Blind Commander to return to normal.</p><br><p>His left hand erupted in blue, cold flames as he held his palm near his stomach.</p><br><p>Tiny ice crystals filled the ruptures, connecting in icy threads, forming something like a grid or framework instead of a heavy ice slab.</p><br><p>Silvana watching the battle couldn't help but appreciate the Blind Commander's intelligence.</p><br><p>'Wow... That's a really good solution, but... it's not something I should be thinking about right now. Adam, what happened to you?'</p><br><p>Then, her eyes switched to the NEP to see how Adam, or rather his Nexus, changed.</p><br><p>"Alright, this is a different story!" Adam exclaimed with a wide smile looking at his hands.</p><br><p>His gauntlets were gone, there was no trace of them, just nothing, they were completely gone.</p><br><p>However, his new Nexus was fully operational, customized to his desires and needs.</p><br><br><p>Two heavy black metal rings were on Adam's middle fingers, deeply planted next to his knuckles.</p><br><p>Each ring was engraved with the image of two intertwining hands.</p><br><p>One hand was smooth and flawless as if made of soft clay from the touch of a master sculptor.</p><br><p>The other hand was the exact opposite, rough and sharp as if made of hard iron, carved by a strong blacksmith who was not interested in beauty but only in efficiency.</p><br><p>The two rings were completely identical, as was the light coming out of them - the crimson flame burned brightly on the rings, flowing rapidly through the hands like a closed circle.</p><br><p>Yet, this was only the outer side, there was also an inner side, not so visible but no less effective.</p><br><p>Invisible purple energy came out from under the rings, running through Adam's fingers and all over his body like blood through his veins.</p><br><p>It could spot the Blind Commander and any other sufficiently powerful being thanks to the sense of energy or Gene Field, but it was nearly impossible for a normal human to do so.</p><br><br><p>Adam's corner of his mouth went up with a predatory glint across his eyes.</p><br><p>"If I'm a weaver, having gear is a good thing, whether it's thread, needle, scissors, or gloves. Good eyesight is important too, but..."</p><br><br><p>Adam clenched his fists tightly, looking at the Blind Commander with anticipation, who was trying to figure out what was going on here.</p><br><p>"What could be more important than hands? Without them, you are useless as a weaver!"</p><br><p>That was the end of his speech. No one made any drastic decisions until a powerful torrent of wind blew nearby.</p><br><p>The wind fluttered the Blind Commander's bandages, passing close to Adam's excited face, his eyes wide open and his arms spread apart.</p><br><p>He felt exalted, and... there was more than one reason for that.</p><br><br><p>The Blind Commander tossed his sword up, deftly catching it by the hilt before taking a wide step forward and pointing one finger.</p><br><p>"So we're back to where it all started then? Good, that's fine with me. Since I have no intention of staying here for long."</p><br><p>Without warning, Adam stepped forward as a purple wave of energy traveled through his body.</p><br><p>His silhouette shuddered, disappearing into the shadows before emerging in front of Blind Commander again.</p><br><p>A fist covered in crimson energy was aimed directly at the monster's bandaged head, about to deliver the second strike of three.</p>
