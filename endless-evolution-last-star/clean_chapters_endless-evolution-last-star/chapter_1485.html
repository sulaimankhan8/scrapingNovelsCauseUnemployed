            <h4>Chapter 1485: Theories</h4><br><p>Silvana was deeply impressed by how Adam’s gaze changed as she listed all the possible components of the Highest Bliss.
</p><br><p>It was all theory, but at that moment, Adam looked like a starving person who was being told in great detail about a delicacy that could shock even the most discerning and experienced gourmets.
</p><br><p>He wanted it. He wanted to experience everything Silvana was talking about, and oddly enough, the only way to do that was to fight someone really strong under dangerous conditions.
</p><br><p>But, at the moment, it was all just theory that had piqued Adam’s curiosity.
</p><br><br><p>The pencil ran across the sheet of paper, placing a "?" next to the Highest Bliss. Silvana wasn’t sure how much her assumption matched reality, but she couldn’t hide that it sounded plausible, especially after she saw Adam’s reaction.
</p><br><p>’Each Grand Star takes into account all of Adam’s previous choices, as well as his path up to this point. If you think about it from that perspective, it’s not surprising that to become stronger, he must achieve the Highest Bliss.’
</p><br><p>Adam was almost certain that fighting a strong enemy was exactly what he needed, but Silvana calmed him down, and they agreed to just keep this option in mind for now.
</p><br><p>A few moments later, Silvana bit her lip, clenching her shoulder.
</p><br><p>’Tsk, come to think of it, Adam’s excitement about risky fights has started to spread to me as well. When I saw his eyes, those two abysses... They started to consume me. The desire to risk everything and rush into a bloody, brutal battle was reflected in my heart as well.’
</p><br><p>"Hey, are you there?" Adam tilted his head to the side in confusion.
</p><br><br><br><p>"Yeah, I was just thinking. So... we’ve somewhat decided on the Highest Bliss, at least for starters. What about the Bottomless Void? Any ideas?"
</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Adam hummed. "Maybe it’s the opposite thing?"
</p><br><p>Silvana raised an eyebrow.
</p><br><p>"I don’t think that’s possible. I mean, even if we’re right and in the case of the Highest Bliss, you need to fight and reach the peak of your feelings, then what do you have to do to get the Bottomless Void? Just nothing? Or admit defeat right away? That doesn’t sound too good."
</p><br><p>Adam rubbed his chin thoughtfully.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, I’d even say it sounds bad. I’m not going to lose! What’s more, I’m not going to admit defeat when I can win!"
</p><br><p>They discussed a few more ideas, Silvana wrote everything down on a piece of paper, but they weren’t as confident in any of the theories as they were with the Highest Bliss.
</p><br><br><p>When they got to the last condition, the Blood of God.
</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana stared at each other. They knew about many creatures inhabiting this world, but they were mostly monsters and Phantoms.
</p><br><p>Sure, the Hybrids, Touched Humans, and even the Artifacts were also taken into account, but there weren’t as many of them as humans and monsters, especially monsters, of which there were tens of billions.
</p><br><p>"Blood of God, huh?" Silvana chuckled. "What the hell is this? Maybe it’s just some kind of monster?"
</p><br><p>"Well... That would be too simple. I don’t think that’s the case. I had an idea that it might be something like a level of power, but a God? I mean, even the strongest Lords don’t have the title of god. And, even if that were the case, I wouldn’t stand a chance against them. I’m sure a single drop of their blood has enough energy to blow me to pieces!"
</p><br><br><p>Silvana tapped on the table with a thoughtful look, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t figure out where they could get the Blood of God.
</p><br><p>"Looks like we’ll have to ask someone for advice anyway. Although I think you were going to do that anyway, weren’t you?"
</p><br><p>Adam shrugged as he leaned back in his chair.
</p><br><p>"When I didn’t know what the Connected Heart and Dark Heart were, Damien helped me understand them better. Although... To be honest, he’s not very good at explaining it. Still, I’d like to talk to him about it."
</p><br><p>"I see. In that case, I’ll contact Beth in a few days. I don’t know if Damien has any free time, but I hope we’re in luck."
</p><br><p>"Kha!" Adam chuckled. "Considering how powerful that bastard is, he only goes on one mission every six months. I mean, imagine how bad the situation must be for him to have to intervene personally?"
</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes. "Hmm. I never thought about it that way. You’re probably right. If something so serious happens that the Citadel has to ask for his help, it’s a rare event, and it happens somewhere very far away."
</p><br><p>They didn’t waste any time, and Silvana immediately wrote to Beth, Damien’s Operator. Silvana had her contact because they had met Damien several times for various reasons. Sometimes he helped Adam with advice, sometimes with a mission, and sometimes he beat him up during sparring.
</p><br><p>Then, they made two hot cups of coffee, thinking about what they had to do next.
</p><br><p>The Third Grand Star was an important step in Adam’s evolution, but they couldn’t rush. They had to do everything right.
</p><br><p>"Tsk, starting tomorrow morning, I’ll start looking for all the information about your conditions. I’ll try to find the answers, and..."
</p><br><br><p>Adam gently took her hands, causing Silvana to gasp. She had gotten too caught up in the process.
</p><br><p>"Calm down. It’s not a death sentence, it’s just a list of conditions. I’m sure that with time, we’ll figure it out and decide which of the three conditions will be easiest for me to fulfill. Then I’ll return to the Dead Lands, but now..."
</p><br><p>He glanced back at their empty kitchen.
</p><br><p>"Shouldn’t we be thinking about the upcoming party?"
</p><br><br><br><p>"I decided it would be nice to invite Alexia and Louis as well. I mean, we met them by chance at the casino, and it turns out Alexia is at the same level as me. I think it would be useful for us to talk more about this."
</p><br><p>With a slight delay, Silvana nodded.
</p><br><p>"Right, the dishes... I’ll focus on that."
</p><br><p>Adam nodded as his gaze darkened for a moment.
</p><br><p>’Yeah, cooking a delicious meal will definitely be easier than finding the Blood of God.’</p>
