            <br><p>The wedding was put on hold until the outcome of the battle of The Rule of Power.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, it was only now that the wedding between Osana De Rouzet and Nirosh Marzo was starting to gain popularity.</p><br><p>Every minute more and more nobles were responding to the message from Gladius, those who didn't get the message were trying to figure out what they should do to also have a chance to place a bet.</p><br><p>It seemed that Gladius had some standard by which he determined who was worthy of his message.</p><br><p>Well, at the core it was pretty simple - money, status, power, and influence. These parameters had to be high enough for a nobleman or someone associated with a noble society to receive a message from Gladius.</p><br><p>Such injustice to some people only increased the excitement of the upcoming battle.</p><br><p>From time to time, the website of the demonic auctioneer was updated, even though Gladius was in the banquet hall and not touching his phone.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Either he thought everything out in advance and was completely sure of the course of events, or someone is helping him.' Franz pondered with a deep look.</p><br><p>He spent a long time gazing at the design and various details of the website, the name was appropriate - the purple room. Now and then, a demonic auctioneer would appear next to a photo of a fighter or important information, only to grin, waving his cane, and disappear.</p><br><p>Franz narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>'Shit, even though he told me what he was planning to do when we met at Shadow Carnation, this isn't the first time he's done this. It's impossible to make a website like this in one day and include thousands of contacts of nobles and influential people in the mailing list.'</p><br><p>Then, Franz looked at Gladius again, hoping it would help him better understand what was going on here.</p><br><p>Sure, he was the one who arranged it with Gladius, but Gladius wasn't going to tell him all the details, he just said he would make Adam's fight a big deal, with stakes and in a proper arena.</p><br><p>'Wait... Isn't it obvious who his assistant is? With the way Gladius acts and presents himself, I completely forgot that he's just like me or Adam... He's a Phantom too.'</p><br><p>Franz glanced at Adam and Silvana standing not far away, pausing his gaze on Silvana for a while.</p><br><p>'Operator, right? Gladius, like any Phantom, has an Operator.' Franz's eyes for a moment went wide with realization as he approached Gladius, who returned to the center table.</p><br><p>"Hey, I'm impressed. Your performance was spectacular and now this fight will see not just two families, but hundreds of nobles and all of the Twelve Branches. Damn, you even used that part of The Rule of Power, forcing the fight to be held in only one of the two suitable arenas." Franz uttered, he was sincere in those words.</p><br><p>Gladius nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Thank you, we had a deal, so I fulfilled my side, at least part of it at that moment." Gladius's eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>Franz's corners of his lips curved slightly. He understood what Gladius was talking about, but it was still a long way off before they could continue their deal. The next event on the line was the fight on the Moon Colosseum.</p><br><p>"By the way, I have a question. Who made that website, I think it's called the Purple Room, right?"</p><br><br><p>"Too bad you don't believe in my abilities that you didn't even suggest it was me."</p><br><p>Franz waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Well, assuming such a thing is silly. Someone has been updating the purple room in real time, adding information about events that happened a few minutes ago."</p><br><p>Gladius was silent, he just listened to Franz with a slight smile on his face, waiting to see what conclusion he would draw.</p><br><p>"You know, it could easily be some programmer, engineer, or just someone familiar with technology, but... somehow I think it's your-"</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Just before Franz was about to say the last word, he froze and his eyes went wide, not from surprise or fear but from shock, as if he was having trouble breathing.</p><br><p>Rosalind standing in the distance raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>'Hmm? What's going on there? Why did sir make that expression and stop talking?'</p><br><p>She didn't see anything, unlike Franz.</p><br><p>A transparent purple hand, not unlike a human's, appeared over Gladius's shoulder, as if a demon stood behind him. Several purple threads emanated from the fingers, already tightly bound around Franz's neck.</p><br><p>"Let's not continue this conversation, good? We can discuss the weather if you want, or the quality of the drinks at this wedding, but... some topics are better kept quiet about."</p><br><p>Then, the threads as well as the purple hand disappeared, allowing Franz to let out a sigh of relief.</p><br><p>He wasn't scared or angry, on the contrary, he had a satisfied smile on his face.</p><br><p>'I don't know why you didn't even give me a chance to talk about your Operator, but it's curious.'</p><br><p>Franz said to himself, looking at Gladius and bringing himself to his feet.</p><br><p>'Though... I'm not sure I'd want to meet your Operator. Operators often resemble their Phantoms, well... or vice versa. One demon in his face is already more than enough.'</p><br><p>Hustle. Hustle. Hustle.</p><br><p>The guests were whispering, discussing the suspension of the wedding, and the invitations they received to the purple room.</p><br><p>They had nothing to worry about, except what bet to make when the opportunity opened up and on whom.</p><br><p>But, for some people in the banquet hall, this situation was not entertainment but a disaster.</p><br><br><p>Zarot and Mariel slowly climbed up on stage, standing in front of Nirosh and Osana with serious faces.</p><br><p>They glanced at each other, then cast menacing glances at Osana, they realized that she had planned all this from the beginning.</p><br><p>However, before either of them could say anything, a shadow appeared behind them.</p><br><p>Zarot and Mariel instinctively turned around only to see Adam.</p><br><p>His eyes were aloof and empty, deep as the abyss, and his fingertips were trembling.</p><br><p>He turned to Zarot and Nirosh.</p><br><p>"You... You are of the Marzo Family. I want to know who I'm going to fight. I want it to happen as soon as possible."</p><br><p>Adam's voice grew quieter, filling with something sinister as his gaze when he saw Gladius's aura.</p><br><p>"I'm tired of waiting."
