            <br><p>During the battle against the Plague Reaper, Adam saw the External Artifact for the first time, but he didn't get a chance to interact with it, instead, the Plague Reaper did so.</p><br><p>Adam remembered it as if it happened yesterday - the Plague Reaper suppressed the Fume Throne with his power, gaining not only the stored energy but also full control over the Fume Cathedral.</p><br><p>It didn't matter that the Plague Reaper didn't use any of it, the point was that interacting with External Artifacts was possible.</p><br><p>And, now Adam was experiencing it for himself.</p><br><p>In some ways were the External Artifacts like people or monsters? Each of them needed a different approach.</p><br><p>Some recognized only power as the Fume Throne, while others wished to start with a conversation.</p><br><p>Adam blinked a few times in confusion looking at the nameless External Artifact.</p><br><p>"Your name...? Wait... Can you talk?"</p><br><p>Only one of the two questions was answered:</p><br><p>[Yes... My name is...]</p><br><p>But, they weren't the only ones here who could talk:</p><br><p>[Hahaha! Adam... Stop stalling in answering... Can't you see that it only makes it more afraid!]</p><br><p>Adam didn't know how, but he completely understood what the Evolution Tree was talking about, just a glance at the red crystal was enough for him to understand.</p><br><p>Even though it was neither human nor a monsters, he could easily sense its emotions and desires, although he couldn't do the same with his Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>It was like how an adult and experienced person understood everything just by looking at the expression on a child's face: joy, sadness, lies, or resentment, everything became clear at once because one had experience and the other had not yet learned to lie and hide emotions.</p><br><p>Sure, the External Artifact had no face, it was not a living being of flesh and blood at all, but there was a superior substitute - energy.</p><br><p>Whether it was because the External Artifact moved into Adam's inner space or Adam's experience was unknown, he felt as if he knew everything about this object.</p><br><p>Soon, Adam nodded deeply and clenched his fists tightly, directing his confident gaze at the crystal.</p><br><p>"Sure, speak up, no one will hurt you here."</p><br><p>At that moment, if the Evolution Tree could, it would have grinned widely, for a multitude of reasons.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With a slight shiver, as if embarrassed, the Outer Artifact replied:</p><br><p>[My name... or my title... is the Lone Blaze of the Fallen Serpent...].</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow. He was expecting to hear a real name like humans, but soon he just shrugged.</p><br><p>"Well, so Lone Blaze it is, fine."</p><br><p>[No... That's not my full name!]</p><br><p>However, Adam did not accept this protest and waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"It doesn't matter. Why are you in my inner space? Why are you so afraid? What do you want from me...?"</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree uttered:</p><br><p>[Adam... I think it's worth clarifying first... that we won't eliminate Lone Blaze.]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree's tone was such that Adam would agree with its opinion.</p><br><br><p>Adam rubbed his chin with a confused expression.</p><br><p>"What makes you think that? I don't mind getting something of value or simple energy. If that requires destroying the External Artifact then I'm ready."</p><br><p>Your next chapter awaits on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam stepped forward, stretching his right shoulder as if he were about to fight against Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>[No! No! No! Please stop...!]</p><br><p>Yet, it didn't help, Adam's gaze grew colder, he was completely serious, or at least doing his best to appear so.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree didn't know how to react but slowly began to guess what Adam's plan was.</p><br><p>Soon, Lone Blaze muttered in a sad voice:</p><br><p>[Although... Who cares... It would happen soon without your involvement... Make it quick...]</p><br><p>Lone Blaze was about to leave Adam's inner space, until at the last moment he shouted:</p><br><br><br><p>"You're afraid of what's in the depths of the fortress, aren't you?"</p><br><p>Lone Blaze said nothing but slightly bobbed up and down like a man nodding his head.</p><br><p>"Good, that's where I need to go. In fact, it wasn't part of my plans to meet you, though I won't deny it's a curious experience."</p><br><p>Lone Blaze remained silent, but Adam could sense that External Artifact was pleased when it heard his last words.</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand blithely.</p><br><p>"Look, I've seen that External Artifacts can offer something in return if you pass their test or something. I'd like to do similar stuff with you."</p><br><p>Then, before Lone Blaze could respond, Adam's gaze changed and his eyes became as cold as cruel blades.</p><br><p>"But, if you refuse, that's fine. In that case, I'll just destroy you for all the hardships you put me through with these fucking Commander, statues, and runes!"</p><br><br><p>A startled squeak spread around as Lone Blaze spun from side to side bouncing across the darkness, trying to think of something that could convince Adam to work together.</p><br><p>Adam furrowed his eyebrows heavily, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Do I have to wait a long time? Or don't you have an answer?"</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree watched silently, enjoying the scene. It thought Adam would need help, but he was doing fine on his own.</p><br><p>[Wait! I've got something....!]</p><br><p>Lone Blaze exclaimed, hoping Adam would listen to it.</p><br><p>[I was hoping we'd have a simple separation but... I guess I have no other choice...]</p><br><p>Then, Lona Blaze muttered like a displeased girl with cheeks puffed up in resentment:</p><br><p>[We can make a pact... The monsters in the fortress won't touch you anymore and I'll help you destroy what lurks in the depths... what I'm so afraid of...]</p><br><p>Adam listened attentively. He acted confidently, but he was a complete novice in this matter.</p><br><p>[Then... If we both stay alive... then upon completion of the pact, you will receive...]</p><br><p>At that moment, the Evolution Tree abruptly entered the conversation.</p><br><p>[That's enough, he doesn't need to know more for now...]</p><br><br><p>One of the snow-white roots headed forward pointing at the First Wall, this explained to Lone Blaze the situation.</p><br><br><p>After a few seconds, Lone Blaze turned to Adam.</p><br><p>[So... Are you ready to make a pact with me...?]</p>
