            <br><p>Whether it was Adam or any other Phantom, Phantoms were obligated to help each other in difficult situations. Sure, some might refuse like Iren since no one could force them to, but most Phantoms were willing to help any fellow Phantom in trouble.</p><br><p>Fred, Ester, and Romeo were here, and for the same reason, a few other K1-Squads that were near Iron Beacon or in the nearby ruins of Salt Village were on their way.</p><br><p>However... In especially dangerous situations, when a strong monster or aggressive Phantoms from the Lower Ring appeared, the Citadel would send help directly from the center. It was always a stronger Phantom.</p><br><p>Sometimes, it could even be someone like Damien, one of the Second Rank Phantoms, but it happened more on his whim, and only if the mission could be finished quickly, so he would not waste his valuable time.</p><br><p>This time, the dark fighter was quickly heading towards Iron Beacon. There was only one K2-Phantom inside, but that was more than enough for a mission like this.</p><br><p>No matter how strong Tirana and Olax were, they were no match for the K2-Phantom, especially considering Fred, Ester, and Adam were on the battlefield as well.</p><br><p>A man with calm eyes and short black hair looked at the rapidly passing clouds. Iron Beacon was about thirty more seconds away and he would be in position.</p><br><p>"Well... Who would have thought it would turn out like this?" Prago muttered, staring thoughtfully ahead.</p><br><p>It had been a while ago that they were fighting to the death, and now Prago was going on a rescue mission for Adam.</p><br><br><p>A massive rock with a sharp tip pierced the cockpit, killing the pilot and stopping the fighter.</p><br><p>Prago's eyes went wide as he abruptly stood up and opened the black case, pulling out his Nexus - a massive halberd with a sharp dark blue blade.</p><br><p>He hadn't expected someone to attack him directly into the fighters at all, but he had no time to waste worrying about it. The pilot was already dead, and the best thing he could do was get ready to fight!</p><br><br><p>Prago rushed forward, jumping out of the fighter. He turned back only to see dozens of rocks turn the fighter into nothing.</p><br><p>Then, Prago glanced down, meeting his gaze with a fragile-looking girl with two long scarlet pigtails and a confident smirk on her face. However, her muscles would be the envy of any man, they weren't massive, but they were tough and strong as steel twigs.</p><br><p>"Run if you want to live!" The girl exclaimed, pointing her hands at Prago. On her wrist was a black NEP - that was more than enough for Prago to realize what was going on here.</p><br><p>"Oh... I see..." Prago muttered, with a calm look while currents of wind lifted his long coat.</p><br><p>The girl gulped. She didn't hear what he said, the distance between them was too great, but she saw his lips move.</p><br><p>However, what alarmed her were his cold, serene eyes as if he didn't consider her a worthy opponent.</p><br><p>'Wait... What the fuck is going on here...? Isn't he the same K2-Phantom that's been sitting out all the time in the Citadel? Rumor has it he even lost a battle to three K1-Phantoms! He's supposed to be trash, isn't he?!' The girl inwardly exclaimed before her eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>The air in front of her trembled as a multitude of sharp rocks appeared out of nowhere, launching straight at Prago.</p><br><p>Prago couldn't seem to dodge as he was in the air, and he needed to stop his fall or he would risk breaking his legs on landing. If K1-Phantom had been in his place, that landing would have resulted in death, not broken bones.</p><br><br><p>Prago swung his halberd in front of him several times, smashing each of the rocks perfectly.</p><br><p>Then, Prago released his aura immediately with Second Stage Spirit, unleashing harsh pressure on the girl.</p><br><p>"Fuck... Looks like I'm out of luck this time..." The girl shuddered, gradually releasing her aura to deal with the pressure.</p><br><p>There was still their fight ahead, during which everything could change, but something was obvious - this was not the same Prago that had fought against Adam, Edir, and Kayla ten days ago.</p><br><p>Sometimes it took only one thing to get out of the deep hole that a man had driven himself into with his fears and insecurities - for someone from above to show him how much light and life he was losing by sitting in the dark pit.</p><br><p>Defeat for Prago was crushing, but it was through such defeats that one could change completely. It didn't take much time to become strong, and in Prago's case, he just needed to catch up, it took determination.</p><br><br><p>However, even if Prago was the winner, it wouldn't happen quickly, and moreover, anything could happen during the fight. Now, Adam, Fred, and the others had lost their K2 savior, but Tirana and Olax were in the same situation.</p><br><p>"Who's that little brat?" Tirana frowned, casting her gaze at Romeo.</p><br><p>Romeo stood in the distance, already ready to launch new arrows if necessary. He realized that from this distance Tirana could not hurt him.</p><br><p>In fact, Tirana was in a difficult situation, Ester and Adam together were strong enough to overwhelm her, even with Adam's exhaustion. Fred and Romeo could shoot at her at any moment and there was nothing she could do about it since they were out in the open.</p><br><p>"Should I deal with him?" Olax asked as black smoke began to cover his body.</p><br><p>Tirana shook her head as she looked towards the ruins that were about a kilometer away from them.</p><br><p>"No. The plan is still the same, just don't let him get away. Now, the situation has completely changed, because time is short for them, not us." Tirana said menacingly, pointing her sword at Adam.</p><br><p>"Agh? What the hell is she talking about?" Ester said, puzzled, rubbing the back of her head and approaching Adam.</p><br><p>Adam smiled as he waved his hand.</p><br><p>"It's been a while, hasn't it?"</p><br><p>Ester smiled bitterly as a flame reappeared in her eyes.</p><br><p>"Yes. Back in battle, as it should be!" Ester exclaimed vigorously.</p><br><p>Fred, who was watching them, shook his head.</p><br><p>'Damn, can't you be a little more serious? One day she's going to die because of this, it's bound to happen.' Fred pondered, preparing to fire, but something distracted him.</p><br><p>Soon, everyone was paying attention, not just Fred, as several dozen shadows appeared from the far ruins. It only took them a few moments to realize what Tirana was talking about, for now, they had to run again, not fight.</p><br><p>"We're leaving...?" Ester asked uncertainly, clutching her axe tightly. She was ready to fight, but not suicidal.</p><br><p>Adam wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by Silvana's harsh voice.</p><br><p>'Adam! Look at the top!' Silvana shouted.</p><br><p>Adam immediately did, only to see three huge vortices located right above their territory.</p><br><p>Lightning discharges were constantly appearing among the vortexes, powerful and aggressive, showing that it was electricity that was the main power here and not the wind.</p><br><p>Then, the vortexes descended to the ground with bright flashes in the center, creating some objects on the ground with a powerful, dense energy that only artifacts could possess!</p>
