            <br><p>The few surviving Light Yellow Threat monsters were doing the same as Katrin and Osana - they were watching Adam and Nessa try their best to deal with Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>Nessa was able to escape the black air with her powerful breath capable of causing a storm, but... it did not affect whether they would win or not.</p><br><p>Once Adam recovered from Plague Reaper's attack, their fight took the shape it should have.</p><br><p>Nessa and Adam attacked from all sides of their enemy, trying to overwhelm Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>A few minutes ago, Plague Reaper had tossed Adam aside to keep him out of this situation, but now he didn't need to do that.</p><br><p>Throughout the fierce fight and intense pressure, Plague Reaper had taken a few wounds from both Adam and Nessa, but this was happening less and less often with each passing second.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper like any monster and especially Crown Type could adapt quickly, he got used to the speed of his enemies, their abilities, movements, and fighting style.</p><br><p>Nessa's physical power was superior to Plague Reaper's, but she lacked speed and mastery, and most importantly had no abilities to suppress Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper blocked Nessa's attacks with his scythe since his coat couldn't stop her claws. He could no longer allow Nessa to reach his flesh once more.</p><br><p>Adam tried to take advantage of this, but... even if Nessa made Plague Reaper focus his attention only on her, Adam couldn't hurt Plague Reaper because of his coat.</p><br><p>No matter where Adam attacked, whether it was his shoulders, back, or legs, the jaws just appeared out of the thick darkness, blocking his needle and silver claws.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam's needle was strong enough as his claws to wound the jaws, broke a few fangs, but once they vanished and reappeared they were unharmed.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper took a deep breath before quickly turning around like a black whirlwind.</p><br><p>At the same moment, his foot plunged into Adam's stomach and the hilt crashed into Nessa's chest throwing them off in different directions like living projectiles.</p><br><p>Adam and Nessa smashed into the ground, rising quickly with faces contorted with pain and exertion only to rush back into the fray.</p><br><p>"No... This can't go on..." Katrin muttered biting her lip.</p><br><p>Osana nodded with a great frown.</p><br><p>"Yes... but there's nothing we can do. Though I won't lie, I know what you're talking about. The longer they fight, the better Plague Reaper understands what he has to do. Every move he makes, every attack he makes becomes more precise, faster, and proper." Osana noted.</p><br><p>Then, she looked closely at Adam and Nessa.</p><br><p>"Adam hasn't changed in any way, he continues to fight as well as before, he's even improved a bit, but that girl... Nessa... she's panicking more and more. She's frustrated because she can't win and that makes her weaker, while Plague Reaper is just getting better."</p><br><p>Katrin didn't say anything she just clenched her fists tightly with a quick glance around.</p><br><p>They needed some new plan, she realized that.</p><br><p>If Adam or Nessa fell, then Plague Reaper's victory would be inevitable. In that case, they would all die, only Plague Reaper would be left alive inside the ring of flames, everyone else would fall victim to his creepy scythe.</p><br><p>Then, Katrin looked up at the roof of the Fume Cathedral and her eyes went wide. She clearly had an idea, a dangerous but doable and realistic one.</p><br><p>"Hey, Silvana, you can hear me, right?" Katrin asked staring at Adam, who had Plague Reaper's elbow smashed into his face.</p><br><br><p>'Sure. I take it you want me to arrange something with Adam?'</p><br><p>"Yeah... And not just with him. Get in touch with this girl's Operator, she'll have to buy me and Adam some time."</p><br><p>'Hmm? What are you going to do?' Silvana asked with slight concern in her voice.</p><br><p>She realized that Katrin had some sort of plan, it was obvious from her tone that this was almost their only chance to win, but to do that they needed to make it as well as possible.</p><br><p>Katrin took a deep breath before slowly rising from the ground. With the pollen from her ability, she had regained some energy, though it was only enough for one use of the First Order, nothing more.</p><br><p>"Listen to me carefully. Adam and Nessa must do as I say. We will have to split the fight for a short period."</p><br><br><p>"Oh... Looks like we're about to see something curious." Refesa muttered watching Adam, Nessa, and the others move.</p><br><p>She was Nessa's Operator on this mission, so Silvana had told her about the plan.</p><br><p>"What do you think of it? Can they make it work?" Magnus asked raising an eyebrow before looking at Nessa with slight concern.</p><br><p>Refesa leaned on her hand, staring at the screen thoughtfully.</p><br><p>"Well... I do not doubt Adam, he will do whatever it takes to ensure this plan works. Katrin... before this mission, I didn't know she existed, but given her past actions and the fact that she came up with this plan, the odds of her screwing up are pretty slim."</p><br><p>Refesa said as she narrowed her eyes intently watching Nessa.</p><br><p>"So, it all depends on her. If she can hold out long enough for Adam and Katrin to do their part, they'll have one more fighter. The three of them will be able to crush Plague Reaper. After all, he's strong, but not invincible."</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Nessa's gaze became more serious.</p><br><p>A minute after Katrin had contacted Silvana, everyone was already aware of Katrin's plan and who was supposed to do what.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, because Nessa had superior physical strength and her claws could rip through a Plague Reaper's coat, she was the one who had the most difficult and important part of the plan.</p><br><p>'Fine... I didn't even realize they came here for this and it's come to this... Well, I can handle it. I only need to hold out against this bastard for a few minutes, maybe even less. If I can't do that, what's the point of my recent development anyway?' Nessa pondered before blocking the black blade.</p><br><p>Normally, in this situation, Plague Reaper would have been attacked by Adam. Nessa and Adam did this all the time, trying to clutch Plague Reaper from both sides, but this time Adam decided to pull back sharply.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper looked at Adam baffled, not realizing what he was doing. Instead of launching an attack, Adam was running towards Fume Cathedral.</p><br><p>This confused Plague Reaper greatly, but he was puzzled even more when he saw Adam's fiery, focused gaze. It showed that he wasn't running away, but moving with a clear purpose.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper didn't know it at the time, but that was the moment Katrin's plan came into motion.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>Before Adam reached Fume Cathedral he saw several spiky roots emerge from the ground next to the passage - the best Katrin could do in her condition.</p><br><p>The roots moved straight for the roof, wriggling quickly to reach their target.</p><br><p>Then, Plague Reaper's eyes went wide when he saw Scarlet Pyromancer lurking in the Fume Cathedral.</p><br><p>The realization was reflected in Plague Reaper's gaze, followed by a slight panic and fear that their plan could lead to his death. Stay tuned for updates on empire</p>
