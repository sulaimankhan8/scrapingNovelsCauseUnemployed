            <br><p>There was only one minute left until the end of the betting. By this time, most of the nobles had been decided.</p><br><p>No one else bet on anyone who was not in the top 10, as they realized that there was no point - their favorite would not be able to participate in the final battle anyway.</p><br><p>However, when there were only thirty seconds left, the guests bet only on the first three people: Adam, Reinz, and another young man from the Twelve Branches.</p><br><p>Silvana glanced at the chart, her eyes filled with sadness.</p><br><p>"Hmm... Looks like you won't be able to participate in the final battle. That's disappointing..."</p><br><p>"Yeah, I guess so." Adam nodded looking intently at his place, "Damn, that makes things difficult. I'll have to watch their fight and find out what to do next. Hopefully, after that, I can throw in a challenge that the administration won't cancel."</p><br><p>At first, Silvana and Adam were shocked by the amount of money they saw, the bets were too big, but now they were not surprised that Reinz had a total of 3 billion credits bet on him.</p><br><p>Sure, no one will win that money, because in this case, the bets were just a way to vote for the fighter they wanted.</p><br><p>The young man with yellow hair was in second place at 2.5 billion. He was behind Reinz but far ahead of Adam who had 2 billion.</p><br><p>The fourth place had no chance of catching up with them with only 850 million, which wasn't even enough to get the golden frame.</p><br><p>Ten seconds before the betting ended, the numbers stopped changing. Everyone had made all the decisions and the two finalists were obvious. Reinz and another nobleman from a great family.</p><br><p>Adam didn't know who the young man with yellow hair was or what great family he came from, but the attention to his person showed Adam that this young man was powerful.</p><br><p>"Agh, it's even kind of a shame that I'm 500 million behind." Adam scratched the back of his head with 5 seconds left before the betting ended.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, an alert rang out, amidst the silence, it was noticeable.</p><br><p>Then, everyone's eyes went wide as Adam's number began to change.</p><br><p>His 2 billion became 2.7 in an instant.</p><br><p>After that, the countdown came to an end.</p><br><p>"Distinguished nobles and guests - the betting period has been completed," observer no. 2 announced, yet even he couldn't hide his surprise, his voice trembling slightly.</p><br><p>"The two nobles, no... the two fighters that will take part in the final battle have been determined."</p><br><p>With a short pause, observer no. 2 exclaimed:</p><br><p>"Reinz Alderran and Adam Vinter will fight this evening at the North Arch!"</p><br><p>Observer no. 2, was obliged to act professionally and follow a plan, but the nobles had no such restrictions.</p><br><p>Bewildered whispers spread through the crowd, the nobles looking at each other, not understanding what had happened.</p><br><p>However, Adam and Silvana were in the same situation.</p><br><p>"Wait... The number has only changed once." Adam gulped, realizing what had happened, "That means that was one bet..."</p><br><br><p>"Fuck, someone bet 700 million on you just to see you in battle? Isn't that too much? A little more and it would have been a whole billion!"</p><br><p>"Yeah, I can't believe it either. From the moment I became a K1 and even more so a K2-Phantom, then I started earning very good money, but... 700 million?"</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Silvana, his eyebrow raised.</p><br><p>"700 million just for one bet...? I mean, it's one thing when it's your entire fortune, it's still crazy... but not as crazy as what just happened."</p><br><p>"But, who would bet that amount of money? Do you really have any fans among the nobles?"</p><br><p>It made Adam wonder, though he had no information about it.</p><br><p>"Maybe it's Damien, though... no, I don't think he cares about anything going on here. It has to be someone from the nobles." Adam pondered tapping himself on the cheek with a hard stare, "Kogen...? Nah, he's a nobleman but not like the others. Shit, I have no idea."</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Silvana's eyes sparkled. Unlike Adam, she knew someone suitable for this.</p><br><p>It didn't matter much now, though, because the fight was only a few hours away.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana had been in bed until almost lunchtime, so they barely had time for a short preparation.</p><br><p>The nobles went about their business as well. Until the fight between Adam and Reinz happens, the administration simply won't accept other fights.</p><br><p>At this time, the Twilight Palace became the most peaceful place in the world. The passageways were filled with conversations, but not battles, because there was no point in them without the opportunity to get twilight coins.</p><br><p>Moreover, the nobles couldn't ignore the fact that today was the so-called Final Battle. It was a rare event, especially this time.</p><br><p>"I can't believe that a commoner will fight against Reinz. This will be the worst battle ever!" the nobleman at the table inside the Amber Cloud exclaimed.</p><br><p>"Don't be so foolish," his interlocutor said coldly, "This is Adam Vinter, not some commoner."</p><br><p>"I agree," the girl nodded deeply, "Moreover, it's the decision of the elders. I don't know what kind of psycho put up 700 million at the last minute, but it's most likely someone from the very top."</p><br><p>"Considering the amount... Hmm..." the second one thought, scratching his chin, "Maybe it's one of the family heads. Could it be Erik Wurhen? As far as I know, he loves gambling more than anything."</p><br><p>The girl appeared puzzled.</p><br><p>"But... The Wurhen Family is in a difficult situation right now. It's unlikely we have access to all the secrets, but as far as I know, they don't have an official head right now."</p><br><p>"Hah," the girl chuckled, her voice full of arrogance, "I doubt someone like Erik Wurhen cares about the official part. After all, he's the strongest in the Wurhen Family."</p><br><p>"Sure," the young man confirmed, his hands folded into a lock, "But, what happened to the previous head? I have a very bad feeling about it. Things have only gotten worse in the last five years, it's impossible not to notice."</p>
