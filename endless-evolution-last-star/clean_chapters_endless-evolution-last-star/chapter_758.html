            <br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The darkness around Adam was actively shaking, forcing him to take one step after another, descending the old stairs to get closer to the blood circle, though... he didn't know which of the three options was his final destination.</p><br><p>"That's enough, I'm already here. There's only a little more to endure, I'm also already anxious to see what kind of opponent lies ahead of me..."</p><br><p>Adam's fingertips trembled in anticipation, with his next breath he clenched his hands tightly into fists, regaining control of the darkness. It took some resistance, but the darkness returned to the inner space, circling the First Wall like a pack of ghosts.</p><br><p>[No... You don't need to fight anyone... Just make them turn the ritual...]</p><br><p>Lone Blaze did not change its stance.</p><br><p>Yet, Adam answered nothing. He had the pact with Lone Blaze, but none of the clauses made him rush or follow Lone Blaze's orders. He had to win and not die, that was originally in his plans.</p><br><p>'Adam, look up, I think there's something wrong with these two...'</p><br><p>Silvana's voice made Adam raise his head, as his eyes went wide for a moment. Above the crimson crystal, two flesh clots dangled from the ceiling, the same as the ones behind the Serpent Gates, but... they were much larger, containing far too much energy for weak creatures like the Sacrificial Holders.</p><br><p>"I see... Well, either way, I have to stop the ritual, which means I have to kill every monster here, I don't know who or what's lurking there, but it won't be a problem."</p><br><br><p>With the next step, Adam's legs tensed up, he was going to tear forward straight towards the nearest monsters at the blood circle.</p><br><p>Their behavior was strange, they had clearly noticed Adam's appearance, he didn't try to hide, his aura was working at full power, but none were in a hurry to attack him.</p><br><p>Sure, they had to make sure that the dark rocks continued to absorb the blood and their energy, but... there were enough monsters that at least some of them tried to stop Adam.</p><br><p>It gave Adam no comfort, he didn't understand why the monsters didn't care, why they didn't act, soon his instincts shared his wariness.</p><br><p>With a whoosh of wind, the palm-sized crimson orb spun quickly, in a heartbeat, launching forward.</p><br><p>The sheer speed made the orb's outline distorted, it flattened slightly, the sound struggling to keep up with its speed, the orb had only one target - a lone Phantom with enough nerve to come here.</p><br><p>A chill ran down Adam's back as his body instinctively jerked to the side, moving out of the orb's trajectory.</p><br><br><p>The rapidly spinning orb swept millimeters from Adam's face, its sharp edges leaving a short cut on his right cheek, just as easily the orb could blow up his head on a lucky strike.</p><br><p>Turning sharply, Adam's eyes swept over the crimson orb to trace its direction. The orb's speed was tremendous, in a moment, it would be crashing into the nearest column.</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, the crimson orb stopped abruptly, almost touching the column, it shuddered slightly and quickly returned to the original point but on a different course. Someone had complete control of the crimson orb.</p><br><p>Soon, they showed themselves.</p><br><p>Two silhouettes appeared from the far walls, watching Adam closely as he passed through the ruined part of the temple, they took no action then, but now there was no other choice.</p><br><p>They couldn't let Adam break the ritual, or their long, painstaking work would be for naught.</p><br><p>But more importantly, in that case, they would fail to live up to their ruler's expectations, to them that was worse than death at the hands of the Phantom.</p><br><p>"What the hell...? Silvana, what are those monsters? They are... very different from all the others..." Adam gulped, feeling the powerful auras from the two silhouettes.</p><br><p>Soon, Silvana answered, her voice trembling slightly, she like Adam had not expected him to encounter such dangerous creatures.</p><br><p>"This is the Soaring Martyrs... And, Adam this is not a Mid Yellow monster... This is the Dark Yellow threat, there is no higher level for K2-Phantoms..."</p><br><p>The Soaring Martyrs, as their name said, floated above the ground, yet unlike the Vile Believers or Thirst Redeemers, they weren't creepy monsters with hideous appearance, since the Soaring Martyrs were the Crown Type.</p><br><p>Two maidens with pale, almost statue-like skin, the texture strongly reminiscent of stone, as if some sculptor had created them and animated them for his evil plans.</p><br><p>White wide cloths covered their torsos, descending from their shoulders and reaching to their knees, ending in tattered pieces. Their delicate legs were pressed tightly together, without a single speck of dirt as they soared a few centimeters above the ground.</p><br><p>Red ribbons ran down the Soaring Martyrs' arms, the sacrificial sleeves giving them strength from the blood. A dense black blindfold covered their eyes, contrasting with their snow-white hair falling down to their shoulders like deadly blades with sharp tips.</p><br><p>Three crimson orbs hovered around each of the Soaring Martyr, the maiden had only to wave her hand to make the last attack that nearly killed Adam, which would happen if he acted carelessly or in a hurry...</p><br><p>It was only after a few seconds that the meaning of Silvana's words reached Adam's mind.</p><br><p>"What...? Dark Yellow threat level? Isn't that too much? I mean... I haven't even broken the First Wall yet!"</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip, she didn't know what to answer. Running away was no longer an option, the Soaring Martyrs wouldn't let him go, and he had to fulfill the pact with Lone Blaze. However, K2W0-Phantom actually had little chance of winning against the Soaring Martyrs, the difference in levels was crushing.</p><br><p>Suddenly, someone else decided to respond without waiting for help from the timid Lone Blaze and the unsure Silvana.</p><br><p>[Hah... Is someone afraid?]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree's voice made Adam frown.</p><br><p>"Is that the best you could come up with?"</p><br><p>[Well... Stop whining, just go and kill them. You don't even realize how strong you've become this day... Your the Two Walls... they're fucking monsters just like you!]</p>
