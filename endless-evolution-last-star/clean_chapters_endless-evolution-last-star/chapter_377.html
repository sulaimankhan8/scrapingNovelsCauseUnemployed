            <br><p>Nessa was alive, this was no secret or surprise. With his most powerful attack, Plague Reaper was able to wound her badly, never in her life had Nessa faced such bloody and serious wounds, but the fact that she was a Hybrid saved her.</p><br><p>Her body was stronger than any K1-Phantom's, most likely even many K2-Phantoms would have died if they had been hit by the hail of red jaws that tore chunks of flesh from Nessa.</p><br><p>There were many ways to die, but being eaten alive was probably one of the most painful, but Nessa was lucky. She got her fair share of hellish pain, but not death.</p><br><p>Her weakened state had been taken advantage of by a random monster, one of the few Light Yellow Threat ones that still survived within the flame ring.</p><br><p>But... It was a fatal mistake.</p><br><p>Nessa was badly wounded, but she was not dead and remained conscious. She wouldn't have moved in any other situation, but her life was on the line when the monster attacked.</p><br><p>Gathering all her strength, she pounced on the monster, ignoring the pain burning throughout her body.</p><br><p>Her arms or legs were too weak to hold the monster or fight. The red jaws didn't just leave wounds on her body, they literally ripped parts of her muscles and tendons out of her body.</p><br><p>This was a significant weakening for someone who relied almost solely on physical power. The fact that she could move her arms and legs to pounce on the monster was already a miracle in itself.</p><br><p>However, some muscles were working properly, even though almost all the others were badly damaged. It was her jaw.</p><br><p>Normally she wouldn't take such desperate measures, but did she have any choice in her situation?</p><br><p>"RRROOOOOOOOOAAAAARRRR!!!!"</p><br><p>There was a furious roar, but not from the monster, but from Nessa, who seemed to be possessed by a true beast that knew no mercy.</p><br><p>Her gaze was half-empty, she acted on instinct. Her body couldn't let her die because of some simple monster, especially after all she had been through.</p><br><br><p>Nessa's teeth sank into the monster's shoulder, bursts of blood rushing outward. Clenching her jaws tightly, Nessa jerked her head sharply, tearing off a massive chunk of flesh.</p><br><p>The monster sank into a fiery pain that spread throughout its body, but Nessa wasn't going to stop. She had to tear the monster apart if she wanted to survive.</p><br><p>"Damn... Now she actually looks more like a beast than a human... It's a frightening scene..." Adam muttered, watching the scene from afar.</p><br><p>Katrin narrowed her eyes, watching intently as two more monsters headed towards Nessa. She realized that Adam was in no condition to help anyone, Nessa couldn't handle three monsters on her own, they would just kill her.</p><br><p>"Well, well, either way, we had to get rid of them before moving on to the main prize..." Katrin muttered before looking at Midnight Crystal which was still in the very center of the flame ring.</p><br><p>Midnight Crystal was an unshakable entity that didn't have any clear will or wishes, however, it aroused desires in others, causing monsters and Phantoms to fight each other to gain some of the power of this majestic entity.</p><br><p>'Katrin... What are you going to do?' Alan asked with obvious concern in his voice.</p><br><p>A slight smile appeared on Katrin's face.</p><br><p>"Don't worry about it. It'll just be a little test. I don't have much energy, I have a long way to go before I can fully recover, but..."</p><br><p>Toward the end, Katrin's voice became considerably quieter and more serious. Then, a flame flashed in her eyes. She had new abilities, a new artifact, and even a new nature as a Phantom.</p><br><p>In front of her were two brazen monsters attacking her ally. Could there be better circumstances for her to test her new powers?</p><br><p>Then, Katrin raised her hand, looking at her black coat that was almost no different from the one worn by Plague Reaper. There were slight changes in size and length, but nothing more.</p><br><p>"As in his case, it's not just clothes... Looks like my new Initial Gene used a new Order without my knowledge, it's probably one of the forms or something, right?" Katrin muttered, trying to make sense of the new information that was filling her mind.</p><br><p>She shook her head, shrugging nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Whatever, I know what I can do so, and for now, that's more than enough."</p><br><p>Katrin stepped forward, her coat shuddering, making her disappear like a shadow.</p><br><p>She appeared ten meters ahead before stepping forward once more.</p><br><p>After a few such leaps that happened almost instantly, she found herself next to Nessa, the two monsters already prepared to attack.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Katrin's coat trembled, like a hungry beast that had to use its last strength to fulfill Katrin's wish.</p><br><p>Then, she felt some energy drain out of her to restore her coat's reserves. It was an unavoidable cost as long as she used this ability.</p><br><p>"Wow... This is different from what I've done before. Moreover, it seems to be something rare, I haven't seen the other Phantoms I've gone on missions with have something like this..." Katrin muttered, amused.</p><br><p>She bit her lip while keeping the joy in her gaze. She realized that she would need to get used to using her new abilities, but she was ready for it. It was her wish, after all.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>To the thudding footsteps of the monsters running towards them, the first one collapsed to the ground, torn apart by Nessa.</p><br><p>Experience new tales on empire</p><br><br><p>The monsters roared furiously, about to attack them.</p><br><p>Nessa's body instinctively went into motion, but no sooner had she taken even one step forward than she fell to the ground, hitting her face in a puddle of her blood mixed with the monster's. Her body was simply incapable of following her will.</p><br><p>"Even though this is the first time we've met today, you're a frightening Phantom." Katrin smirked, standing up in front of her.</p><br><p>Following, Katrin took a deep breath, guiding her now single, left hand, forward.</p><br><p>Her eyes sparkled as her fingertips lit up with purple flames, quickly covering her hand like a veil.</p><br><p>The two monsters were running at the same speed, being right next to each other, this gave Katrin an idea.</p><br><p>"Nothing bad will happen from one extra step, right?" Katrin nodded speaking to herself.</p><br><p>Her coat shook again as she found herself not in front of the monsters, but to the right side of them.</p><br><p>The monsters quickly turned their heads, realizing that somehow, Katrin had drastically changed her spot.</p><br><p>But... it was already too late for them to do anything about it.</p><br><p>One vertical, one horizontal, Katrin made two swings of her arm, leaving a flaming cross in front of her.</p><br><p>For a moment, the cross hovered above the ground, causing dust particles to ignite like sparks before moving forward.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the flaming cross passed through the monsters, tearing them apart with ease, leaving a wide black trail of burning embers behind.</p><br><br><p>Massive chunks of flesh fell to the ground, their edges burned as if after a massive explosion or merciless fire.</p><br><br><p>Nessa coughed up blood, her eyes wide with pain, but she quickly regained her senses.</p><br><p>"Looks like I went a little over my limits, but it was worth it..." Katrin muttered looking at the two slain monsters in the distance.</p><br><p>She clenched her hand tightly into a fist with a happy smile on her face.</p><br><p>"This is it... This power, and... I finally have it..."</p>
