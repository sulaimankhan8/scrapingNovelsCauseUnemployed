            <br><p>"I see... So if I just show up at the wedding before The Rule of Power with Eight Blades, not only will I protect my family but I will improve the lives of literally hundreds or even thousands of people in the slums..."</p><br><p>Adam muttered folding his hands together, his pensive gaze directed forward.</p><br><p>Rosalind cast a glance at Franz.</p><br><p>"Sir... if you will allow me."</p><br><p>Franz nodded and took a sip of tea, he trusted Rosalind more than most people in this world.</p><br><p>"Mr. Adam, although the final decision rests on you, I would like to say that this is a really good offer."</p><br><p>Rosalind pointed at Franz.</p><br><p>"You must realize that to achieve our goal it is very important that Zarot knows we and the Balo Family are involved in the breaking up of the marriage between his son and Osana De Rouzet. That detail alone changes everything completely."</p><br><p>Adam rubbed his chin thoughtfully, he understood what Rosalind was talking about, but there was something else he wanted to figure out before making a final decision.</p><br><p>"You said you were angry at the Rouzet Family as well, what did they do? Did they have something to do with what happened to Nelya too?" Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>Franz sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"Well, I talked to those of them who were at that banquet. From the conversation, I figured out that they knew what Zarot was planning to do. Not only did they not stop him, but they wouldn't accept my demand to put the pressure on him by the two families and punish him."</p><br><p>Franz snorted irritably, taking another sip of tea.</p><br><p>"What was I even hoping for, though? Those two families are on very good terms with each other, especially their top ones. Obviously, they'll be covering for each other. That's good enough for me."</p><br><br><br><p>Neither Franz nor Rosalind was in a hurry to get Adam to answer. They gave him time to think it over properly.</p><br><p>"Fine, I agree. Rosalind is right, this deal is too good for me to pass up. However..."</p><br><p>Then, Adam's eyes grew colder and his tone harsher.</p><br><p>"If I find out you haven't kept your promises, I promise I'll find a way to hurt both you and the Balo Family."</p><br><br><p>"Fair enough, but you have nothing to worry about, I assure you."</p><br><p>Franz waved his hand, giving the order to Rosalind with a gesture.</p><br><p>She nodded and returned a moment later with a tray, a prepared document, a pen, and a seal.</p><br><p>Wasting no time Franz took the seal and put it in place of his signature, the seal was the same as his family's emblem but with his initials inside.</p><br><p>"Here." Franz handed the document to Adam, "You can read the whole thing. Don't worry, there will also be digital copies, we will send them to Silvana as soon as possible."</p><br><p>Adam nodded and immediately picked up his pen, not intending to read into the details. Though he didn't bother to do so, Silvana's eyes were intently scrutinizing every letter, so Adam was sure there were no traps in the document.</p><br><p>"Good, if you don't mind I'd like you to come here every day until the wedding. Rosalind will teach you the basic etiquette of nobility, more specifically how you should appear at the wedding as well as..."</p><br><p>Franz ran a glance over Adam's suit.</p><br><p>"To find you more appropriate clothing. Who put you in that suit anyway? You don't look so formal and austere."</p><br><p>In response, Adam silently pointed at Silvana sitting next to him.</p><br><p>Silvana looked away with her chin tucked up.</p><br><p>"Pffft, this makes Adam look much more serious. We were going to a banquet, not a masquerade party so I think it was a great idea!"</p><br><p>Franz smiled bitterly, glaring at Silvana.</p><br><p>"Hah, you picked a different one for yourself. Hahaha, well, Adam you don't have to worry, me and Rosalind will find something outstanding for you, you can consider it a little bonus."</p><br><br><p>He wasn't much interested in dressing up or creating some sort of image. In fact, the only time he'd ever picked out clothes happened in the Fall Hill Prison.</p><br><p>'Hmm... If you think about it, what I picked out then was pretty good. Maybe Franz and Rosalind can impress me?'</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply before standing up.</p><br><p>"Alright, I'll take it. The wedding is only a few days away. I don't have anything important planned until then, so I'll just have to come here anyway." Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>Franz nodded and folded his arms into his wide sleeves.</p><br><p>"Good, in that case, I'll wait for you. Rosalind will pick you up every day. You're going to stay at the Gray Castle for the rest of the term, right?"</p><br><p>Adam's eyes narrowed. He didn't realize Franz knew about his training, but it didn't surprise him much since Franz had no trouble finding out about his arrangement with Osana.</p><br><p>"Yeah... I still have some unfinished business, even though I've already gone through the training." Adam said slowly and waved his hand, "Come on Silvana, time to go back."</p><br><p>"Sure." Silvana nodded and followed him.</p><br><p>Before she left she turned to Franz and bowed low: "Thank you for the invitation and the tea. I hope this is not our last meeting."</p><br><p>In response, Franz only picked up his cup of tea, nodded, and took a sip as he watched Adam and Silvana walk out of his mansion.</p><br><p>Rosalind glanced at Franz.</p><br><p>"I take it you are pleased with the result?"</p><br><p>Franz smiled before finishing his tea.</p><br><p>"Yeah, although I had to tell a little more than I planned, but in the end it only went to the good."</p><br><br><p>The next day, the first thing Franz and Rosalind did was wake up and have a cup of coffee with some gourmet desserts. Explore more adventures at empire</p><br><p>It was his typical breakfast that he preferred to share with Rosalind.</p><br><p>"The sun came up only recently and the weather is just perfect, shall we go for a walk? I think Adam and Silvana won't be here until the afternoon or later in the evening." Franz suggested with a slight wave of his hand.</p><br><p>Rosalind nodded, her face calm.</p><br><p>"Sure, give me one minute before I clean everything up."</p><br><br><p>The door opened as Franz and Rosalind walked out of the mansion, heading deep into the woods on a stone path gradually changing to a simple path.</p><br><p>They only occasionally exchanged phrases, enjoying the weather and the tranquility that the forest and nature itself offered them.</p><br><br><p>A strong gust of wind passed through, making Franz's long purple hair flutter, and for a while the tips of his hair rose above the ground, moving slightly upward to downward.</p><br><p>He looked towards the forest with a slight smile on his face before turning towards the path.</p><br><p>Franz stopped abruptly, his face went pale and his eyes went wide.</p><br><p>In front of him stood a tall man with short black hair, attractive facial features, and eyes as blue as the ocean who appeared out of nowhere.</p><br><p>His suit was so exquisite that compared to it, Rosalind's clothes seemed faded and unworthy of attention.</p><br><p>"Nice weather today, isn't it?" Gladius said with a calm voice, a slight smile on his face that did not portend a threat.</p>
