            <br><p>Previously, Adam could barely block Damien's attack thanks to the threads from his Second Order, but... when Damien started using energy everything changed.</p><br><p>His threads were unable to absorb the amount of damage contained in just one quick attack, the task was too heavy, and the speed was too fast.</p><br><br><p>The ground beneath Adam cracked, but there was no sign of pain on his face, and his body didn't even flinch.</p><br><p>Damien stared at Adam's hand, it seemed as if Adam's grip weighed several tons, wanting to pull the black rod towards the ground.</p><br><p>"Oh... This is something interesting, something new..." Damien muttered with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><br><p>Adam jerked his wrist, flipping Damien around as if he were a lightweight puppet.</p><br><p>If Damien had been focused, he wouldn't have let Adam do it, but he was too fixed on Adam's new ability, staring curiously at Adam's hand.</p><br><br><p>Damien's shoulder touched the floor, followed by his back lying on the cold stone slab.</p><br><p>"Hey, you're suddenly become so much stronger physically... But, how long will your body be able to withstand that kind of force?"</p><br><p>Damien asked with an evil smirk on his face. He knew better than anyone that great strength had a price to pay, either in health, energy, or time.</p><br><p>"Agh..." Adam took a deep breath, "Even if you're right, I can still do it..."</p><br><br><p>Adam clenched his fist tightly as purple energy streams reappeared, enveloping his wrist and moving towards his hand.</p><br><p>Damien was in no hurry to dodge, he lay on the floor, curiously watching Adam's slow but truly formidable actions.</p><br><p>"Hmm... The lightning bolts are an effect of his artifact, so... is it his Elemental Root?" Dahla said thoughtfully before turning to Silvana.</p><br><p>Silvana glanced at her, puzzled, but soon, she realized what Dahla wanted from her.</p><br><p>"Yes." Silvana nodded quickly trying to hide her delay, "It's the gravitation element that takes up most of his Elemental Root. But, it didn't give him any active ability before, just a balance enhancement and a slight physical gain."</p><br><p>Dahla was silent for a while, gently gripping her chin, her gaze fixed on Adam, who was making his attack.</p><br><p>"I see. Well, I wouldn't call it an active ability, it's more like a short boost with a serious side effect, but... it's a decent ability."</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes slightly, slowly turning her head and looking coldly at Dahla.</p><br><p>"Hm? What are you talking about?"</p><br><p>Dahla reached forward, pointing at their fight.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, purple energy flared brightly, as if Adam was clutching the star tightly in his fist.</p><br><p>But... in the next heartbeat, all the energy and light disappeared, seemingly leaving Adam's attack without any additional power.</p><br><p>That was a mistake. Sometimes, silence and serenity could bring the greatest destruction, since behind their veil they hid true power.</p><br><p>"Hehehe, unbelievable." Damien smirked.</p><br><p>Damien's green eyes went wide, he watched curiously as the air around Adam's fist shook as if adjusting to the changes in gravity.</p><br><p>To affect gravity all that was needed was mass, the higher the mass the greater the change. Then, with speed, mass became a brute destructive force.</p><br><p>Obviously, Adam's fist wasn't heavy enough to cause changes in gravity, for that would require objects with much greater size and density. Well, he wasn't an ordinary human, but a Phantom, so he had the energy to do impossible things.</p><br><p>'Fine, the viewing is over, it's time to leave.' Damien thought, about to bounce to the side.</p><br><p>He was curious to see what Adam's punch was capable of, but he didn't want to test it by getting hit.</p><br><br><p>'What...?' Damien's eyes went wide when he realized he couldn't move freely.</p><br><p>The energy coming from Adam's fist pushed him to the ground like an invisible barrier, causing the gray concrete to crack, making Damien's situation even more difficult.</p><br><p>"Hah, not bad Adam, too bad your opponent is me!" Damien shrieked with excitement, channeling his energy to his legs and arms.</p><br><p>At the last moment before Adam's fist was about to come down, Damien slammed his palms into the ground and jumped aside.</p><br><p>He tried to retrieve his rod but failed as it was pinned tightly to the ground by the powerful pressure.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Damien found himself dozens of meters away from his last spot, but Adam was not going to stop, he had put too much power into this punch.</p><br><p>Moreover, he had another target besides Damien.</p><br><br><p>Adam's fist crashed to the ground, right into the center of the black rod.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The chamber shuddered like an earthquake, a trembling far more active and powerful than coming from Damien's energy attacks.</p><br><p>Wide cracks spread rapidly from the center, breaking the thick stone slabs apart and separating them from each other, reaching the ground level that was several meters below.</p><br><p>The stone fragments closest to the impact simply turned to dust under the intense pressure.</p><br><p>There were no explosions or energy bursts, it was pure physical power amplified by gravity, producing a monstrous force.</p><br><p>Douglas watching this could only shake his head with a great frown.</p><br><p>"Agh... This isn't an arena... Damn, the chamber isn't built for this... The fight is certainly curious, but every action they take makes my next few days more complicated."</p><br><br><p>Adam slowly pulled his fist from the ground, struggling to unclench it, his fingers were shaking, he needed time to regain control, but a satisfied smirk appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"Hey Damien, what do you think... can that count as 3:2?" Adam asked pointing at Damien's black rod that lay in the depths of the crater.</p><br><p>Damien directed his gaze only for his eyes to go wide. There was a similar reaction from everyone else. They couldn't believe what they saw.</p><br><p>The rod was broken into two even pieces.</p><br><p>"You broke my needle, so... I did the same with your weapon." Adam took a few steps back with a weak look.</p><br><p>He wanted to raise his hands, but he couldn't do it, his hands just didn't obey him, they went limp, and he could barely move his fingertips.</p><br><p>"Oh..." Adam took a deep breath, lowering his gaze, "So that's the recoil and that's with my hands protected by my Nexus. Well, I guess that's pretty fair."</p><br><p>In response to Adam's suggestion, Damien smirked and ran forward.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, he thought Damien was going to attack.</p><br><p>But, just as Damien reached the crater, he took his black rod, or rather there were two, but they were much shorter with sharp ends, then he bounced back.</p><br><p>"3:2, right? Fine, I agree. After all, you broke my weapon, to some extent, it can be considered as a defeat." Damien shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>Adam smiled, hearing praise from Damien would be nice for anyone.</p><br><p>Then, he turned back, glancing around.</p><br><p>Almost half of the chamber was destroyed, there was a crater in the center, holes in the walls from Damien's attacks, many cracks and cuts.</p><br><p>"Damn... We did some serious damage to this place." Adam said awkwardly, scratching the back of his head.</p><br><p>Damien waved his hand with a loose smile.</p><br><p>"Don't worry about it. The military will rebuild everything, even if we destroy the whole place."</p><br><p>Adam nodded, in a way as if Damien's words gave him permission, but to do what?</p><br><p>"In that case, I'll do it without regrets."</p><br><p>Damien tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><br><p>Adam smiled and got down on one knee, leaning toward the ground. He put his palms to the floor as his eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>Then, the threads on his gauntlets trembled.</p>
