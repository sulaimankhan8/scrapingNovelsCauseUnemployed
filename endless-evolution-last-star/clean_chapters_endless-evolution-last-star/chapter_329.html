            <br><p>Katrin was amazed as she watched the amazing scene developing in front of her. Two Auras and two Spirits were able to work together, thanks to Osana's actions.</p><br><p>'Bitch... She's the support, when did she manage to develop her aura to this level? I gave it a lot of attention and effort, but all I was able to achieve was first-stage Spirit.' Katrin bit her lip, with obvious envy towards Osana.</p><br><p>But... she couldn't help but admit that it was beautiful.</p><br><p>Adam's Spirit, which had looked majestic on its own, now resembled a true warrior who used his partner's power to protect them and everyone else.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The needle filled with bright light and pink streams of aura, becoming much larger and acquiring an outer plume of two colors that covered the needle like the tip of a broad lance.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's eyes filled with curiosity. Despite its intimidating power and history, he had yet to see something like this.</p><br><p>Never once had he lost in a battle of auras, and this time was to be no exception. Erla and Lero couldn't use The Will at all, and Katrin and Oskar weren't strong enough to resist it.</p><br><p>Their first-stage Spirits would die in just a few seconds in a direct collision against Plague Reaper's second-stage Spirit. This was obvious after Oskar's golden sword broke from the black flames.</p><br><p>And... even Adam wasn't strong enough to face an opponent like Plague Reaper. The reason was the difference in their strength and the nature of Plague Reaper's aura, which behaved like a plague that sought to consume and destroy everything in its path.</p><br><p>But... after Osana appeared everything changed dramatically, and not because she was the second wielder of the second stage Spirit.</p><br><p>Her healing effect and extra aura could only delay the inevitable because sooner or later, the Plague Reaper's aura would do its job and devour them all.</p><br><p>Osana waited until it was clear that Adam was able to withstand the dark flame attack, which meant that with her help, he could switch from defense to assault!</p><br><p>'Good... With your ability to pierce any armor, we'll definitely manage to show that we're not victims trapped here.' Osana smirked before walking over to Adam and hugging him tightly, just like her Spirit did with Adam's.</p><br><p>Adam was a bit puzzled, but he quickly came to his senses continuing to build up the aura in his Spirit's needle. He didn't care what Osana's motives were, the most important thing right now was to win the battle of auras, otherwise, they wouldn't even have a chance of winning the actual fight.</p><br><p>Osana's corners of her mouth lifted, forming a sly, slight smile, her gaze looking around.</p><br><p>'To the Phantoms, monsters are victims like beasts are to hunters. However, Plague Reaper is not a victim in the same way we are. We must show that we are worthy opponents.' Osana pondered before taking a deep breath and closing her eyes.</p><br><p>For some reason, Adam felt that his strength had just doubled. It was an illusion, for it was not his strength that had increased, but he had gained complete control over Osana's aura.</p><br><p>He could willfully control her pink aura as he wished and it gave him a feeling of superiority.</p><br><p>"Hah... Thank you." Adam said sincerely, clenching his fist tightly, "With this kind of power, I'm sure I can tear that disgusting black flame apart!"</p><br><p>It was unknown if Osana heard him, she seemed to be asleep and her only task was to hug Adam tightly.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The needle began to shake vigorously as well as Adam's Spirit arm. A little more and too much aura would accumulate in one place, so much so that Adam would no longer hold it back in such a density.</p><br><p>It was an indication that the moment had arrived.</p><br><br><p>Adam pointed directly at Plague Reaper and his Spirit immediately threw its needle straight at the monster. It was only a representation of an aura, so the rules of Adam's actual needle, which had to be attached to his arm by at least one thread, didn't work for Spirit.</p><br><p>The massive needle from the aura, now looking more like a real lance, effortlessly destroyed the first layers of black flames, quickly advancing.</p><br><p>Moreover, as it continued to spread, the lance left behind a white-pink plume that grew ever wider and developed a cone-like trajectory, pushing the death aura back.</p><br><p>The tip of the needle shone brightly as pink and white streams of energy flowed downward like currents, unleashing the full power of Adam's aura amplified by Osana.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper frowned for the first time in ages. He saw that his aura could not resist this power. Adam's aura was effortlessly destroying the dark aura, shattering it like solid armor and Plague Reaper could do nothing about it.</p><br><p>Distant parts of the black flames tried to dive back into Adam's aura and start destroying it, but the pink streams quickly repaired the damage and gave the white flames a new wave of power.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper reached forward, forcing his Spirit into the battle. All the black flames gathered in the scythe, blazing brightly.</p><br><p>Then, Plague Reaper's Spirit, surged forward, unleashing its scythe directly at the needle that had already approached Fume Throne.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A bright flash of light covered the entire Fume Cathedral, illuminating it in three streams of pink, white, and black. They diverged in different directions from one point, trying to suppress each other and destroy the alien aura.</p><br><p>But... As anyone who knew how to use The Will was well aware, for one aura to defeat another, there had to be a serious difference in strength, and... this was clearly not the case.</p><br><p>With a final flash, all the auras disappeared, turning into nothing.</p><br><p>Only a few particles of different colors remained at the point of collision, which quickly dispersed and turned into nothing.</p><br><p>Then, Osana opened her eyes and stepped away from Adam, looking calmly at Plague Reaper, who was staring at them with obvious confusion.</p><br><p>He couldn't believe that just two Phantoms who were on the same level as him could stop him. Moreover, he was the one who had to defend against their attack with his aura, not them.</p><br><p>"Agh... It wasn't easy, but we managed. I've never had such a difficult battle of auras before..." Adam muttered letting out a heavy sigh.</p><br><p>Osana glanced around, staring at the monsters that were hiding behind them.</p><br><p>Seeing that she was annoyed, the monsters decided to retreat and stay out of their way. Now that the monsters saw that Adam was able to stop Plague Reaper, they realized that they had no place here.</p><br><p>If they pissed Osana off even more, then they would be noticed by Adam and then only death would await them. That's how the monsters thought, their feelings were driven by instinct.</p><br><p>Monsters liked to fight, but they were not suicidal.</p><br><p>"Great. But, now we'll have to get to the actual fighting..." Katrin bit her lip staring at Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>"Yeah, but he'll get his reward first." Osana said coldly, looking at Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>No one understood what she was talking about, but then Fume Throne began to actively shake, once again.</p><br><p>Trying to defend themselves from Plague Reaper's aura, they had completely forgotten that Plague Reaper had defeated Fume Throne's aura and thus was worthy of receiving the reward as the new lord of this throne.</p>
