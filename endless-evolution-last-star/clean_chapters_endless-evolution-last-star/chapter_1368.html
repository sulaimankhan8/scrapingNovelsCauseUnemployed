            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1368: Darkness and Threads</strong></p><br><p>From the top of the gray tower, which offered a view of the entire island, a new detail became apparent — a dark dome covering the far part of the island, which had not been there a few minutes earlier.</p><br><p>Both the Silver Beacon and Mona were seeing this for the first time, but they both immediately sensed the ancient aura of the White Spire. It was not as powerful as that of the Silver Beacon, for the White Spire had long since perished, but its depth and age were clearly on another level.</p><br><p>“What is this…?” Bertrada muttered with a tremor as she looked at the dark dome. “Is there something left of the White Spire on this island? But what is its purpose?”</p><br><br><p>Mona stepped forward as her large eyes darkened.</p><br><p>“Mistress… I think there is no change in this.”</p><br><p>“Agh? What are you talking about?”</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a light soared above the dome, forming the silhouette of a monster with menacing fur and silver threads running along its paws. This image had been on the dark fragments from the beginning, but without the energy from the ruins, it was impossible to see, even when looking closely at the seal.</p><br><p>“Adam came here with one goal — to achieve what he desired,” Mona began. “Obviously, only the White Spire can do that. After all, everything here belongs to him.”</p><br><p>Bertrada frowned, but she did not deny it. She was satisfied with her position, and although she wanted much more, she understood that she would need hundreds of years of energy accumulation to approach the White Spire’s former greatness.</p><br><br><p>Mona and Bertrada didn’t know what would happen next, but all they had to do was watch, unlike Adam, who was about to face the most important monster in his history once again.</p><br><p>Adam stared at the Silver Weaver, remembering how he looked on his first day and also in the laboratory where Damien and Douglas were studying the Silver Weaver, who was already dead, floating in a tank.</p><br><p>After all, until that day, until the World Wipe, no one had ever encountered this monster at that point. Adam became the first, and along the way, he realized that it was mostly a matter of luck.</p><br><p>The more Adam learned about the world and the threats that were sure to come, the more he realized that his only chance to make a difference was to become a Phantom. That happened when Adam killed the Silver Weaver and absorbed his genes.</p><br><p>This was the beginning of everything: his Evolution Tree, his energy, his abilities, and even his choice of artifact, as he was a Natural Phantom.</p><br><p>“Silvana… Can you see that?” Adam asked, as if he couldn’t believe his own eyes.</p><br><p>“Yes…” She nodded slowly. “That’s definitely the Silver Weaver. Sure, it’s not real, because you killed him, but still… If this is a real trial from the White Spire, it will be difficult to overcome.”</p><br><p>When Adam faced an opponent, he had only two moods: either detached coldness, because his opponent was too weak, or fiery excitement because his opponent possessed great power.</p><br><p>But now… Adam didn’t understand what he was feeling.</p><br><p>So much time, so many battles, and so much reflection had passed since that day that Adam no longer saw the Silver Weaver as the terrifying monster that had nearly ended his life a year and a half ago.</p><br><p>He saw in the Silver Weaver only an old opponent, almost a friend, and a warrior like himself who wandered this world hoping for the best.</p><br><p>“You… Hah.” Adam’s voice trembled. “I’m so glad to see you. Even if you’re not real. It’s still incredible…”</p><br><p>Slowly, the Silver Weaver moved closer, and with each step he took, the darkness dissipated, replaced by gray, lonely sand.</p><br><br><p>A gust of wind appeared out of nowhere, carrying grains of sand close to Adam’s cheeks.</p><br><p>Something caught the corner of his eye, causing him to turn back.</p><br><br><p>He looked at a gruesome tar lake, full of dirt and debris, with a dark red container at the edge.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Adam’s heart began to beat faster as the events of the first day rushed through his mind.</p><br><p>It was the container where Adam ended up after Aiden Henk threw him out of his observatory like trash. In just a few minutes, the Phantom was supposed to arrive and save Adam from the Two-Clawed Cat.</p><br><p>But… that didn’t happen.</p><br><p>This place was not only his memories, but also the arena for his battle.</p><br><p>Perhaps his last one.</p><br><br><p>Adam flinched when a deep voice, unlike that of a human or a monster, sounded from above.</p><br><p>Most of all, this voice resembled the Evolution Tree, but it was obvious that it was someone else.</p><br><p>[I’m sure you’re puzzled… But, you gathered the seal and came here of your own free will… just like you came to this island…]</p><br><p>“Y-You!” Adam exclaimed. “Are you the White Spire?”</p><br><p>[Not exactly… Unfortunately, the White Spire is dead, although your assumption is not entirely wrong.]</p><br><p>After a few moments, the voice continued.</p><br><p>[This entire island… the White Spire’s body and rules are still here because his energy still fills these lands… I am that energy… You can consider me a part of the White Spire… but I am only a branch that managed to survive after the great tree fell…]</p><br><p>Adam gulped as he nodded deeply. It was logical, because the Silver Beacon only used this place, but did not rule it. She was not the owner, but rather a temporary administrator, nothing more.</p><br><p>[This trial has remained hidden for a long time… it was created only for those who want to achieve their goal, whatever it may be… Since you are here, you have such a goal. Isn’t that right?]</p><br><p>“Yes. The Desire of Beyond, I need it to become stronger!”</p><br><p>[Hmm… How interesting… It’s possible, but I must be sure that you are worthy.]</p><br><p>Soon the voice returned:</p><br><p>[Tell me… What is your ultimate goal, because becoming stronger is only one step for you, right?]</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand before exclaiming from the bottom of his heart.</p><br><p>“The World Wipe! I want to stop it, at any cost!”</p><br><p>[Ha… Ha… Ha… I expected a lot, but not this… In that case… as part of the White Spire, I will do everything in my power to make this trial the most difficult one in your bright life…]</p><br><p>The voice disappeared, and with it, a white aura burst out of the Silver Weaver, covering the monster with energy.</p><br><p>Adam immediately understood what was happening.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver is evolving — going through many stages at once.</p>
