            <br><p>Every warrior had to have either a tactic, a favorite strategy, or especially a sense of combat, to know how to fight and how to come to victory was the most important thing.</p><br><p>Certain tactics were usually used by the calculating or those who were slightly weaker than their opponent, and Jade Lady fit those criteria perfectly.</p><br><p>Her position was lower compared to Thunder Demon, and considering it was Top-2 and Top-3, the difference was significant. The monsters from the Top-99 and Top-100 were almost equal in strength, but the higher up, the more each position in the rankings mattered.</p><br><p>Moreover, the Conqueror Type couldn't directly fight against Prime, Crown, or Essence Types. In a 1 vs. 1, the Conqueror Type was the weakest, but that was the specialty of this Type because only they had subordinates they could empower.</p><br><p>Jade Lady's tactic was quite simple but effective - she was going to drain Thunder Demon, and her subordinates were the best way to do that.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>As soon as the golden glint coated Jade Lady's sword, the shattered Ladies began to regenerate. Parts of their bodies attached themselves, bonding with a bright light before becoming one piece again.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon only smirked, he didn't even look at the Ladies, for he didn't consider them worthy opponents. He was watching someone who he thought was quite interesting.</p><br><p>Whoooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>Hundreds of dark crystals, like indestructible blades, spun at tremendous speed, leaving hundreds of tiny cuts on Jade Lady's perfect, pale skin.</p><br><p>Jade Lady's eyes went wide as she swung her arm, trying to stop the spinning disk, but... she didn't have enough strength to do it.</p><br><p>The Obsidian Armadillo only accelerated, causing Jade Lady to flap her wings and fly high up, fleeing the encounter in shame.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, all of her wounds were actively healing, she was able to restore her protective jade layer as long as she had the energy to do so.</p><br><p>Jade Lady looked at Thunder Demon and swung her sword, ordering her subordinates to step back and stand in front of her like her personal army.</p><br><p>"Rgha... Rgha... Rgha..." Thunder Demon made a strange sound similar to laughter, but not human, but a monster, with an obvious wheeze, and part of a menacing roar.</p><br><p>Jade Lady frowned, she felt that Thunder Demon was mocking her.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Obsidian Armadillo unfolded, standing up on the ground and looking at his would-be opponents. They had all come here for one purpose - to fight, so they had to be prepared to die.</p><br><p>It was unknown how long these three would look at each other before they began to fight, but this was an opportunity for the Phantoms to take a break. But... was that really the case?</p><br><br><p>A man with a long dark blue coat jumped onto the ruins, heading towards Adam and Fred with a confident stride.</p><br><p>They hadn't noticed him yet, for their gazes were fixed on the three monsters that could start fighting at any moment.</p><br><p>"Hey, what the hell are you doing here?" Prago said menacingly, rising behind Adam.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam's eyes went wide when he heard the familiar voice as he abruptly turned around only to meet Prago's cold gaze.</p><br><p>"Prago...?" Adam muttered, puzzled. He didn't know which particular K2-Phantom had rushed to their rescue, and in fact, he had already forgotten about it. There was too much going on for him to remember such a small thing.</p><br><p>Prago nodded deeply, looked closely at Adam, and said:</p><br><p>"And? You've clearly fought, I can tell by your tired look and a few wounds, but... unlike them, you can still fight, can't you?" Prago frowned, pointing at Ester and Romeo lying on the floor.</p><br><p>Adam didn't answer anything, he just stared at Prago, not understanding what he wanted from him.</p><br><p>The first thing Adam thought was that Prago wanted to get him in trouble for what had happened at Fall Hill Prison, but he quickly realized from Prago's gaze that it was something else entirely.</p><br><p>There was no anger in Prago's eyes, only irritation and obvious disappointment... in Adam, the one who had helped him get back on track.</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Fred and hesitantly said:</p><br><p>"We... We're waiting for help to arrive! There are dark Phantoms and three Top-5 monsters here! Even if I wasn't injured and weakened, I'm not an idiot to fight them!" Adam waved his hand, seeming to realize what Prago was getting at.</p><br><p>Fred wanted to say something, for he was in complete agreement with this plan. It was pragmatic and most importantly - safe.</p><br><p>In their situation, the most important thing was to survive, wasn't it?</p><br><br><p>Prago abruptly grabbed Adam by the collar, pinning him forcefully against the wall with a deadly serious look.</p><br><p>Adam tried to free himself from Prago's grip, but he simply didn't have enough strength to do so. After all, Prago was a K2-Phantom and was physically stronger.</p><br><p>"What the hell did I just hear?!" Prago shouted like a fan genuinely disappointed in his idol, the sincerity was visible in every detail.</p><br><br><p>"Afraid to fight monsters? You? Dark Phantoms? Fuck you!" Prago growled as he slammed his fist into his own chest, "You're fucked up and confident enough to fight against a K2-Phantom, against me, and win!"</p><br><p>Prago continued his righteous speech:</p><br><p>"After you beat me, humiliated me, and destroyed my old world, I was finally able to come back and become Phantom again. I thought that when I came here, I would see you standing in the middle of a sea of blood, tearing monsters apart, but... I only met disappointment!"</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide as something deep inside him clicked, and his gaze slowly began to change.</p><br><p>"I won't hide it, it was difficult, admitting defeat. I took advantage of my status and found as much information about you as I could. You never ran or hid. Shit, you killed a Steel Knight when you were almost a rookie and chopped apart Dark Phantoms even though you said you didn't fight humans before!" Prago uttered, with a hard stare.</p><br><br><p>Prago tossed Adam aside, pointing his halberd at him, a dangerous glint running across it.</p><br><p>"Nothing stopped you before! You did what had to be done! Needed to kill a monster - you killed! Had to slash Dark Phantoms - you slashed! Had to defeat a K2-Phantom to get out of prison - you won!" Prago shouted, his hand shaking slightly.</p><br><p>Prago bit his lip, clenching his fist tightly.</p><br><p>"Tsk. You are not the Adam Vinter I fought against. I don't see you as the light that helped me out of the hole I put myself in! I see only the same dark, fearful blur I've been all along!"</p><br><p>Prago was silent. At that time, Adam rose slowly and walked toward him.</p><br><br><p>Adam passed Prago, stopping at the edge of the ruins and staring at Thunder Demon, Jade Lady, and Obsidian Armadillo.</p><br><p>'Adam! Don't even think about it! It's too dangerous! Prago's offer will only lead you to death!' Silvana exclaimed in panic, realizing that Prago's speech was having its effect.</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam touched his earbud and said:</p><br><br><p>Silvana's face turned pale with shivers all over her body.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam's eyes filled with blood, and all of his veins swelled violently. His Evolution Tree was trembling vigorously, preparing to fight to the limit.</p>
