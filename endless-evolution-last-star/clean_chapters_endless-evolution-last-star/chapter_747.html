            <br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>For some time, hundreds of monsters and Phantoms watched the battle between the two strongest fighters in the armies unfold.
</p><br><p>The local battles for this period did not stop, but everyone realized that a lot depended on three factors that could happen soon:
</p><br><p>Katrin could win and for the Phantoms and the monsters of the fortress it was the best option, but unfortunately for them, the chances were not even close to 50%.
</p><br><p>The second best option for the monsters both in the fortress and outside the walls was the death of both Katrin and the Dormant Lord, this would remove the threat to the walls and also open up the possibility for other monsters to get more resources since there would be no the Dormant Lord. However, this was definitely the outcome with the lowest probability, almost impossible.
</p><br><p>For two fighters to die from each other in a bloody battle, their strengths should have been as equal as possible, and... this was clearly not the case.
</p><br><p>The last and most likely outcome was the victory of the Dormant Lord. It wasn’t the best option for the monsters, but it wasn’t the worst either. With the victory of their strongest fighter, the Eclipse monsters would guarantee themselves a complete takeover of the fortress and victory over the Phantoms.
</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord would take Most of the resources, but such a victory was far better than the defeat that awaited the Phantoms in the event of Katrin’s defeat.
</p><br><p>Sure, the fortress had many strong Phantoms, but they were no match for the Dormant Lord.
</p><br><p>Thus, Katrin’s victory was the only option that allowed the Phantoms to survive this night.
</p><br><p>Everyone realized that, including the One-Eyed Serpent Archers, the Phantoms might fight against them later, but it was far better than trying to defend themselves against the Dormant Lord during the eclipse.
</p><br><p>Simultaneously, acting in sync as a single mechanism, the archers created arrows, pulling the bowstrings of their massive bows to the limit.
</p><br><p>Their eyes stared at the black and white flashes crashing into each other at breakneck speed.
</p><br><p>Katrin and the Dormant Lord collided several times a second, their bodies at the limits, giving them all the power available to them. Yet, even though Katrin had two swords, she could barely keep up with the Dormant Lord’s pace.
</p><br><br><p>The Dormant Lord appeared to her right, in a heartbeat her first sword blocked his fist, a fist, but her eyes already reflected his second fist coming straight for her face.
</p><br><p>She blocked it with her second sword, but the next moment she had to do the same, bouncing back each time.
</p><br><p>Katrin was also making attempts to attack, but she was having a hard time doing so. The dark jaws were afraid to approach the Dormant Lord, the vibrant light giving them only a few seconds to attack before they disappeared, burning into embers.
</p><br><p>The crimson energy on her sword was a very powerful ability affecting an enemy of any power, but it took a short amount of time. Katrin would need one second for her sword to absorb the Dorman Lord’s power, but he didn’t give her that luxury.
</p><br><p>The second ability of her Nexus, made her much faster and stronger, allowing her to use a second sword that had all the properties of the first sword and the plague effect if she wanted it.
</p><br><p>However, all of this crumbled before the Dorman Lord’s fists were covered in powerful, dense light. He didn’t use light blades or plasma spears, his energy was enough to turn his fists into full-fledged weapons that scared away darkness and wreaked havoc.
</p><br><p>At the next clash, a purple light reflected in Katrin’s eyes. She was afraid that the archers wanted to kill her, but she quickly realized that their target was the Dormant Lord.
</p><br><p>’Katrin, you need to stall him somehow, if only for a second.’ Alan said quickly realizing what the archers wanted to do.
</p><br><p>"Sure... but it’s not easy at all..."
</p><br><br><p>With a serious look, Katrin lunged forward, coming right under the Dormant Lord’s fist. However, her coat blocked the blow, turning into a thick black mass in front of her.
</p><br><p>Part of her coat immediately began to burn from the bright light around the monster’s fist, but that was just the beginning.
</p><br><br><p>Under Katrin’s shout, all the dark jaws came out of the walls, raining down on the Dormant Lord from all sides. The scorching light would quickly turn them into nothing, but Katrin didn’t need much time.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, Katrin bounced back, but her entire left arm from shoulder to wrist remained at the Dormant Lord’s side.
</p><br><p>A piece of dark coat, quickly jumped onto the monster’s chest, covering its shoulders and waistband like many chains.
</p><br><p>When the Dormant Lord was surrounded by Katrin’s spawns, the One-Eyed Serpent Archers realized that this was their only chance.
</p><br><br><p>With a slight flick of the hand, four arrows flew off the bowstring, whistling through the wind currents with a deafening whistle.
</p><br><p>Seeing the arrows reach the black mass, her eyes lit up with bright flames.
</p><br><p>’Yes!’ Katrin inwardly exclaimed, clenching her fist tightly.
</p><br><p>But... soon the joy drained from her face, replaced by a lost look.
</p><br><p>For some reason, the four arrows stopped a few centimeters away from the Dormant Lord’s back. The arrows shook vigorously, electrical discharges surging outward in a desperate attempt to reach their target, but the invisible wall ahead just wouldn’t let that happen.
</p><br><p>"What’s going on..."
</p><br><p>Katrin’s voice shook, there was nothing like this among the Dormant Lord’s abilities, he had no way to defend himself other than a bright light.
</p><br><p>And... neither Katrin nor Alan, none of them were wrong, the Dormant Lord didn’t use any abilities. Continue reading at NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The layer of darkness shuddered, exploding in the moment, all dark jaws and Katrin’s sleeve turned to nothingness under the scalding light.
</p><br><p>It was expected, but the light should have had no effect on the arrows, and it did not.
</p><br><p>Katrin’s eyes went wide as she saw a small, dense disk the size of a palm hovering behind the Dormant Lord, it was this disk that kept the arrows from traveling further.
</p><br><p>Except for objects filled with energy, only other energy could stop energy, even in its pure form, which was exactly what the Dormant Lord did.
</p><br><p>The white disk was his energy condensed into a single point thanks to Energy Control, as could be seen by the thick streams flowing towards it.</p>
