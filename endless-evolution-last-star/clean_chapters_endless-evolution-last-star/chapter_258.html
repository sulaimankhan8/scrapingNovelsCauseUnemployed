            <br><br><p>Magnus ran quickly, holding the bleeding Nessa in his arms. Sure, he might not waste time examining her, but... if there wasn't a crazy idea in his head after her words, he wouldn't have been in such a hurry.</p><br><p>In fact, although Magnus could get some bonuses from treating the injured slum dweller, it would hardly make him speed up his step.</p><br><p>He was a pragmatic bastard and that was why he was where he was now. However, now he was running faster than ever with an excited grin forming on his face.</p><br><p>Soon his legs began to ache, Magnus would never let that happen, after all his comfort was above all else. Some slum girl's life wasn't worth his exertion. Yeah, Magnus's selfishness and heartlessness were astounding.</p><br><p>However, there was something more important in this world than Magnus's comfort - his ideas!</p><br><p>If he had an idea in his mind that he thought was worthy, his well-being and anything else that was even remotely important took a back seat.</p><br><p>Perhaps that was the kind of person one had to be to become a free scientist at such a young age. An idea, a desire to create a masterpiece, something unique and unrivaled - for this Magnus was even ready to die and kill millions.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, don't you dare die child! You will become my masterpiece! Don't you dare take this opportunity away from me!" Magnus exclaimed running up to the lab.</p><br><p>While at first he only had a nascent plan of action on how to cure Nessa, now he was completely confident in his actions.</p><br><br><p>As soon as the sensors detected Magnus, all doors immediately opened in front of him, though other scientists had to be checked in order to do so.</p><br><p>Descending to the lower floor, Magnus quickly ran forward into his private part of the lab, forbidden to others.</p><br><p>"Mr. Magnus! This girl needs medical attention immediately! You must carry her to our sector where we heal the sick!" A man in a white coat, with aging gray hair and a short beard said, standing in the aisle Magnus ran past.</p><br><p>Magnus stopped abruptly as he glanced at the man. The man was one of the respected researchers at Miracle Observatory, with a wealth of experience and voluminous knowledge.</p><br><p>"Quick, if her heart is still beating we can save her. The wounds are serious, but it looks like we still have a chance." The man reached out his hand about to take the girl.</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Magnus's foot plunged into the man's stomach, throwing him aside. The man's back hit the wall with obvious confusion.</p><br><p>"First of all, this isn't your sector or department or anything. Everything here belongs to me! This land, all the equipment, the employees, you and that girl! You're all fucking mine and only I decide what to do and how to do it!"</p><br><p>Magnus waved his hand.</p><br><p>"If I wanted to just save her I'd have called the regular doctors. Get the fuck out of my lab you piece of mediocrity!"</p><br><p>Before the man could realize what was happening, Magnus gritted his teeth and ran on. He couldn't afford to lose another second.</p><br><p>Upon entering one of the many rooms.</p><br><p>Magnus immediately placed Nessa on the operating table, picking up a scalpel and other instruments. Despite his aggressiveness and arrogance, Magnus's skills could allow him to act even prouder.</p><br><p>Within moments, all the metal shards were removed from Nessa's back. Sure, Magnus didn't care at all if she was hurt or not, for it didn't matter now - she was dying!</p><br><p>"Fine, let's see how bad it really is. Normally I would do this in a more technological way, but we don't have time, you know?" Magnus uttered before flipping Nessa over onto her back and slashing her stomach with a sweep of his hand.</p><br><p>A few more precise cuts and the full picture were revealed to Magnus. Several vital organs, namely the kidneys and liver were severely damaged, they had practically become a bloody mess.</p><br><br><br><p>"Well, if you were Phantom I would suggest you try my new method. However... if I give you a piece of the regenerative monster, even the weakest of them will kill and consume you. You don't have the energy to have any chance of success." Magnus pondered rubbing his chin.</p><br><p>Then, a sly grin appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"However, I wouldn't have brought you here if I didn't have another idea. You have no energy, after all, you are a simple human, but... monsters differ from humans first of all on a physical, or rather biological level, only then does energy come into play."</p><br><br><p>"Claws, tough skin, fangs, extra body parts, and organs, all of these things contain energy, but they didn't come about because of it. I can't make you change with monster energy, you'll just die, but I can change you biologically. That's what I was thinking when you said monster." Magnus spoke as if he was having a conversation with Nessa.</p><br><p>However, she could barely hear anything and could hardly see anything. There wasn't much time left before she would close her eyes forever because of the heavy bleeding.</p><br><p>Though stopping the bleeding wouldn't solve anything, her wounds were too serious, and most importantly...</p><br><p>Nessa's body was too weak at the moment. If someone tried to heal her in the usual way, even with the best equipment, her body simply wouldn't be able to withstand it.</p><br><p>"Agh... right, you can't answer me." Magnus muttered, rubbing the back of his head.</p><br><p>Then, Magnus waved his hand and walked over to a white case, inside of which were several syringes filled with blood, but not human blood but monster ones.</p><br><p>Magnus took a syringe, previously this blood belonged to a Crown Type monster.</p><br><p>There was no energy left in the monster meat, especially after a few days, only physical cells that could begin to metamorphose into a human body if too much of it was consumed like what happened to Kai's sister at Red Feast.</p><br><p>But... what about the blood? It's filled with energy, but when the blood is flowing inside a living monster rather than staying for a long period in some syringe.</p><br><p>Well, that was the whole point. The blood in the syringe was maximally compressed, consisting almost of cells that were once full of energy instead of liquid.</p><br><p>It was like a nuclear bomb, each cell was a tiny nuclear bomb whose core had long ago lost its energy, but... the physical material remained and it could be used for something.</p><br><p>What if you put these bombs into a mechanism that could use them even if they were deprived of power?</p><br><p>Not for an explosion as powerful as a nuclear one, but something simpler, like a battery or keeping something powered, since the material was still there, it just wasn't fit for its original purpose anymore.</p><br><p>Yeah... that was exactly what Magnus was about to find out now.</p><br><p>Either Nessa's body would find a way to utilize the monster's thick blood, its exhausted cells, or she would die like the millions of people who had once tried to drink the monster's blood - their bodies would simply be torn apart.</p><br><p>"I don't know if it matters, but Crown Type is the best option for this situation..." Magnus muttered approaching Nessa.</p><br><p>"Normally I'd have to inject a syringe into your vein or let you drink it, but... you're in no condition to swallow anything and we don't have time. There's a more drastic way." Magnus's look became more serious than ever when he thrust the syringe straight into Nessa's stomach, injecting the monster's blood inside her.</p>
