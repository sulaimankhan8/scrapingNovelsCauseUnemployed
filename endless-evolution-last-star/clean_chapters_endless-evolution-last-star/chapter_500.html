            <br><p>Silvana was stunned.</p><br><p>However, it wasn't the events of the fight between Adam and Tron that caused such a reaction, but Tron's gaze fixed on Riska.</p><br><p>'Oh... How unusual. Even though it wasn't the best situation right now, it's amazing that he realized everything in an instant. It was enough for him to just see the expression on Riska's face.' Silvana pondered, feeling a little envious of Riska.</p><br><p>Silvana didn't know if Adam could understand her at a glance, especially in a situation like this. It was a level they hadn't reached yet.</p><br><p>Then, Silvana shifted her gaze from Tron to Riska.</p><br><p>She usually looked kind, smiling, and rushing to help and comfort everyone. If Riska wasn't an Operator but a simple person, she would be the perfect mother and wife.</p><br><p>Now, all her good qualities hadn't gone anywhere, but there was no longer a smile on her face, and her eyes were downcast, filled with guilt.</p><br><p>Sure, it couldn't be called a serious mistake or misdemeanor, but Riska understood that he couldn't keep such a simple secret.</p><br><p>Tron shook his head, then back to the battle, he had other things to do now, Riska's turn would come a little later.</p><br><p>Dahla noticed the situation, but even for her to interfere in their affairs in this case would be too much.</p><br><p>"Well, it's time to bring you back to your senses." Dahla uttered, picking up Adam's right hand from the ground.</p><br><p>She walked over to him, looked at his wounds, and put her palms together, then her eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>A small amber star appeared above Adam, lowering its glowing beam onto his body. His wounds were recovering quickly, from small cuts to his severed arm that was actively fusing with his body.</p><br><p>If Adam were a K4-Phantom then Dahla would have to put a lot more energy into healing at least some of his wounds, but since there was a difference of two levels between them, it wasn't a problem.</p><br><br><p>Adam's fingertips came into motion as he slowly opened his eyes.</p><br><p>The first thing he saw was Dahla's annoyed expression, her arms were crossed over her chest, and her gaze was looking down at him.</p><br><p>"Hah... Not the best thing to see after a nap, but not bad either." Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>Dahla frowned as she raised an eyebrow menacingly.</p><br><p>"What did you say? You should be crawling at my feet for spending so much energy on you and healing you all the time. This is the second situation like this!"</p><br><p>Adam made a strange look on his face, stood up, and glanced away.</p><br><p>"Damn... It's one thing to ask for thanks but to crawl at your feet... You're turning out to be a pervert..." Adam muttered, walking past Dahla.</p><br><p>For a moment Dahla's cheeks flushed as she realized what she just said, but then her face twisted in anger.</p><br><p>"Fuck! I'm not a pervert!" Dahla exclaimed, her voice spreading throughout the training hall, "How can you be so stupid and take a phrase like that literally! Damn it!"</p><br><p>Silvana, watching this scene got an ambiguous expression on her face.</p><br><p>'Well... She's right and wrong at the same time... Although I didn't expect that from Adam either. It was just an arrogant phrase from Dahla. If I heard that, I wouldn't even pay attention.'</p><br><p>Silvana's musings brought her to the point where she stared at Adam with wide-open eyes, then her eyes narrowed as if she was trying to see something or read his mind.</p><br><p>"Enough." Tron said calmly, but his tone showed that he wasn't going to tolerate this anymore.</p><br><br><p>Tron swung his blade, pointing at the spectator room.</p><br><p>"Dahla, exit the arena and return to your seat. And, watch what words you choose. You have the highest level among us, you should be showing an example to young Phantoms like Adam."</p><br><p>Dahla snorted as she strode menacingly towards the spectator room.</p><br><p>"Watch what you say? Fuck it. I'm getting annoyed with the whole thing. No respect or understanding. Everyone is just minding their own business!" Dahla muttered like an old man, she crossed her arms over her chest and leaned slightly forward with narrowed shoulders.</p><br><p>Even Tron was puzzled by this reaction.</p><br><p>He scratched his cheek as he watched Dahla walk through the amber barrier.</p><br><p>'Oh, it looks like it's something more than simple displeasure this time. Is she disappointed about something? We'll have to ask Riska about that, she's always had a much better judge of people than I.' Tron pondered.</p><br><p>He nodded his decision and shifted his gaze to Adam.</p><br><p>While everyone was busy watching Dahla's grumbling, Adam concentrated on himself.</p><br><p>Adam did a short warm-up and was now hopping in one place, preparing for round two.</p><br><p>Tron's eyes got a little wider when he saw that Adam's right hand was empty.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Where's your needle? Are you really going to fight me without your weapon?" Tron asked, with slight disbelief.</p><br><p>He realized that Adam wouldn't underestimate him, which meant Adam did it on purpose.</p><br><p>"Hey, Tron, Dahla, I have one question for you." Adam asked, continuing to low-hop in one place.</p><br><p>Dahla turned around sharply, looking at Adam through amber.</p><br><p>"What do you want brazen?"</p><br><p>Adam glanced at his hands and asked in a nonchalant voice: "Your powers restore my energy too, right?"</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, it's not as quick and easy to do as healing your wounds, but because of the difference in our levels I can easily restore your energy."</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a calm expression, then a sly grin appeared on his face.</p><br><br><p>Adam confidently slammed his fists against each other, sparks flying from his gauntlets before his eyes.</p><br><p>"Tron, I have one guess, but I'm not completely sure about it. However, I know how to check and see if I'm right or not."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Tron raised an eyebrow with faint curiosity.</p><br><p>"If I have infinite energy, then I don't have to worry about some of my abilities taking up too much power. Dahla will fix that."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam's eyes flashed with an unusual violet light, and the air around his hands shook as if for some reason his fists became a few hundred times heavier.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, sending shivers throughout the training hall like a massive giant before leaping forward, folding his fists up, like hammers.</p><br><p>Tron raised his head.</p><br><p>"Oh... My glass sure won't help against something like that. Good thinking, praise." Tron muttered as his eyes grew deeper.</p>
