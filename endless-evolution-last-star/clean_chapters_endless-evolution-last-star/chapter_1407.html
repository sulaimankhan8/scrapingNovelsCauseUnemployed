            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1407: Rule of Blood</strong></p><br><p>From the very beginning, Xander appeared to Adam as a wise leader who knew a lot not only about Izardo and the world, but about the Hybrids as well. This created a stark contrast with Erada, who behaved like a disobedient child and seemed never to want to grow up.</p><br><p>This was clearly evident when Adam told her about his goal.</p><br><p>Of course, the Hybrids knew what the Dark Heart was and that some Phantoms needed to obtain one to become stronger. However, they viewed the Dark Heart from a different perspective and had a different name for it that reflected its essence.</p><br><p>While Xander reacted calmly, as if he had expected this from Adam, Erada couldn’t shake the shock covering her face for a long time.</p><br><p>“Dark H-Heart…?” Her voice trembled. “Do you even understand what you’re asking for?”</p><br><p>Adam looked up as he slowly chewed a piece of meat before swallowing.</p><br><p>“In fact, not completely. That’s why we came here to talk. When I first learned about the Connected Heart and Dark Heart, I was sure I had to kill my opponent, but it turned out that wasn’t the case, at least with the Connected Heart.”</p><br><br><p>Xander put his knife aside and picked up a piece of crispy toast, slowly breaking it apart.</p><br><p>“So, you want to know if you need to kill a Hybrid to get the Dark Heart, or if there’s another way to gain power?”</p><br><p>Adam nodded, giving him a silent answer.</p><br><p>“What? Aren’t you Adam Vinter?” Erada exclaimed. “Why are you suddenly concerned about such things?”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam tilted his head back. “What do you mean?”</p><br><p>“Agh? When I heard your name, I imagined a crazy, bloodthirsty Phantom hungry for battle, just like me!”</p><br><p>Erada’s complaint was strange, but oddly understandable to everyone at the table.</p><br><p>“Instead, you’re sitting at the table with us, eating, and discussing completely different things!”</p><br><p>In response, Adam just yawned demonstratively. “Well, maybe I’m not as much of a battle psycho as you thought. Or… maybe I don’t want to fight a child?”</p><br><p>Erada frowned as her teeth began to grind. She genuinely couldn’t understand whether Adam was mocking her or if he really didn’t love fighting as much as she had heard. It annoyed her greatly, as did the fact that there was nothing she could do about it. At least for now.</p><br><p>“Answering your question, Adam.” Xander continued, ignoring Erada’s complaints. “As with the Connected Heart, directly killing a Hybrid isn’t the only option.”</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, listening intently to Xander.</p><br><p>“Sure, you can kill a Hybrid and absorb its energy. That way you’ll get the Dark Heart, but I don’t think you’ll want to do that. All the Hybrids of Izardo will hunt you down because they’ll know that the only reason you killed one of us is simply greed for power.”</p><br><p>“But?” Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>Xander dipped a piece of meat in the sauce. “There’s another way that Hybrids, at least the Monster Ones, use quite often. When there’s some kind of conflict between Hybrids and even the elders can’t find a solution, we use this method.”</p><br><p>“Pfffft! All these rules and traditions are pretty lame! Why can’t we just fight like the monsters do at lower levels?”</p><br><p>“Because there are so few of us, Erada.” Xander replied sternly. “You should know that better than anyone. If we risked our lives every time there was a conflict or an encounter with the Phantom, we would have disappeared hundreds of years ago.”</p><br><p>She puffed out her cheeks but didn’t argue with him.</p><br><p>“What kind of method is that?” Adam asked with mild interest. “Am I going to have to fight in front of an audience again?”</p><br><p>Xander shook his head. “You’re going to have to fight anyway, but how it happens is up to you and your future opponent. The method I was talking about is called the Rule of Blood.”</p><br><br><p>“Yes. You and your opponent, Hybrid, will have to exchange blood and make a contract through your energy. The loser will be obliged to fulfill any one wish of the winner. That’s how we resolve our conflicts when there is no other way.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded weakly. He understood the rules until he realized that one important detail was missing.</p><br><p>“Wait, what about the Dark Heart? How do I get it? When I fought last time, the Connected Heart was like a prize for winning.”</p><br><p>Xander put the knife aside.</p><br><p>“This time it will be a little more complicated. Even if you use the Rule of Blood, you cannot force the Dark Heart to appear. However, it can happen during a fight, it has to happen.</p><br><p>“It’s a process like an exchange of blood and energy, from the winner to the loser. Only when your minds recognize who is in what position will you be able to get the Dark Heart. In general, you will understand what you need to do, you can be sure of that.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam nodded as he crossed his arms over his chest.</p><br><p>“From what I understand, I have to find a suitable Hybrid for battle who wants to use the Rule of Blood and against whom I can obtain the Dark Heart, right?”</p><br><p>Xander nodded deeply. “Pretty much yes. For that reason, I advise you to choose your opponent carefully. If the victory is too easy for you, you will be able to make a wish through the Rule of Blood, but you will not obtain the Dark Heart that way.”</p><br><p>Helasa, who had been silent for a long time, looked at Xander. “What’s in it for you? You’re being too friendly with a Phantom who wants to fight one of you.”</p><br><p>“There’s no secret here. A fight of this level will be useful for every monster or Hybrid. When will someone like Adam come to Izardo again? Why should I miss such an opportunity?”</p><br><p>Helasa snorted, but did not argue.</p><br><p>“So, Adam. If you want, I can show you some worthy candidates. A battle of this level should be beneficial for both sides.”</p><br><p>A gleam flashed across Xander’s eyes.</p><br>
