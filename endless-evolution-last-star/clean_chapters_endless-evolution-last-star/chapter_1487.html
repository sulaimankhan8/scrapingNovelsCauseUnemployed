            <br><p><strong>Capítulo 1487: Ancient Ice</strong></p><br><p>About fifteen minutes after Alexia and Louis arrived at Adam’s house, his family arrived.</p><br><p>Leona, Gary, and Trici knew they were going to visit their son and older brother, who had bought himself an apartment at the top of a skyscraper. But when they saw it with their own eyes, they simply couldn’t believe it.</p><br><br><p>“Brother!” Trici ran out of the room on the second floor of the penthouse, pointing toward the terrace. “You have a pool on top of the tower? That’s so cool!”</p><br><p>“Ahem.” Leona, who was sitting at the table, slowly cutting her steak, frowned. “Trici, take your seat and don’t embarrass your brother.”</p><br><p>“But! It’s a super cool place!”</p><br><p>Leona said nothing, but her sharp gaze made Trici flinch as she quickly went downstairs.</p><br><p>Before she could reach the table, Adam shouted:</p><br><br><p>Trici looked up as a soda can flying toward her reflected in her eyes. It took her a split second to realize what the soda can was. She didn’t even realize how her hands reached out to it, catching the soda can right in the air.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, joy covered her face. She looked at the simple soda can as if it were a treasure.</p><br><p>Well, for each person, the treasure was different.</p><br><p>And, it was much better for a child to consider a rare soda can a treasure than a gold bar or a luxury watch.</p><br><p>“Wow! Bro, where did you get this?!” She asked with shining eyes.</p><br><p>In response, Adam pointed to Louis.</p><br><p>“You should thank Louis. I have a feeling he can get anything if necessary!”</p><br><p>“Louis…?” Trici muttered, looking at the majestically handsome young man. “Thank you! This is so cool!”</p><br><p>Taking a sip of wine, Louis nodded slightly. “It turned out to be more difficult than I thought, but I was able to find one place where they could still be ordered.”</p><br><p>Leona, as an experienced woman, both as a mother and a wife, couldn’t help but notice how unusual the couple between Louis and Alexia was. Naturally, this aroused her interest.</p><br><p>“Louis, you mentioned that you come from a wealthy family, didn’t you?” she asked.</p><br><p>“That’s right. I won’t hide the fact that a wealthy life has its drawbacks, but the advantages more than outweigh them. You especially begin to appreciate your position when you learn about other people’s lives.”</p><br><p>Leona coughed. This was especially true for their family. They had moved from the slums to the First Ring in just over a year.</p><br><p>“May I ask what your father does?”</p><br><p>“Sure, he’s a shareholder, but he started out as a journalist. Then, he became a reporter, founded his own company, sold it, made a few successful investments, and since then, he’s only been increasing his capital.”</p><br><p>“Pffft!” Alexia snorted. “Who needs all that? Investments? There are bags of gold walking around the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>You just need to go and kill them.”</p><br><p>Louis frowned. “Alexia, there’s a child at the table, and—!”</p><br><p>“Wait!” Trici exclaimed, slapping her palms on the table. “I want to know more! My brother hardly ever mentions the Dead Lands. Tell me about the monsters!”</p><br><p>Perhaps if it had been any other Phantom, Leona and Louis would have been able to stop this situation, but Alexia’s smirk showed them that they didn’t stand a chance.</p><br><p>“You want to know about the Dead Lands? Fine, I’ll tell you, but don’t complain later.”</p><br><br><p>The next few hours were fun. Well, at least for Alexia and Trici. Despite the significant age difference between them, and Alexia being more like an older sister to Trici, they easily found common ground.</p><br><p>Adam, Silvana, Louis, Leona, and Gary basically formed a separate group while Alexia answered Trici’s endless questions.</p><br><p>“Hey, are you sure this is a good idea?” Gary scratched the back of his head uncertainly as he looked at Trici.</p><br><p>“Well…” Adam lingered. “I don’t know if it’s a good idea or not, but Trici would find out about it soon anyway. You could say that she’s now getting a unique experience interacting with a K4-Phantom.”</p><br><p>Leona waved her hand as she took Silvana and Gary by the hands and headed for the kitchen.</p><br><p>“Come on, you two. You need something to drink with me!”</p><br><p>Silvana turned to Adam, but he gestured that everything was fine.</p><br><p>When Louis and Adam were left alone, Louis’s tone and gaze changed, becoming more serious.</p><br><p>“So, Adam. Feeling your aura, I can guess that you recently revealed your next Grand Star, right?” He asked in a low tone.</p><br><p>Adam nodded confidently.</p><br><p>“Yes. The Third Grand Star. What stage is Alexia at?”</p><br><p>“The same. In fact, she would have returned to the Dead Lands long ago to fulfill the conditions. But the wedding and honeymoon, along with the vacation, took much longer than we expected. I’m not complaining, but Alexia hasn’t stayed at the Citadel this long in a long time.”</p><br><p>“Hah.” Adam chuckled. “That just means our situations are more similar than I thought.”</p><br><p>Louis sighed deeply.</p><br><p>“I understand that your conditions weren’t the easiest either, right?”</p><br><p>“Yeah, nothing is certain. Silvana and I have a few ideas about one of the three conditions, but everything else is too vague.”</p><br><br><p>Louis turned to him.</p><br><p>“Have you decided on your next mission? When are you going to return to the Dead Lands?”</p><br><p>In response, Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>“No. Not yet. First, we want to meet with Damien. Last time, he helped me understand how to get some of the conditions for the Second Grand Star.”</p><br><p>“I see. Would you mind if we joined you?” Louis asked with a hint of hope in his voice.</p><br><br><p>“Sure. Why not. In fact, it would be nice if we could help each other. Which condition is Alexia going to fulfill first?”</p><br><p>“Hmm… It’s called the Ancient Frost. That’s the title of one of her conditions.”</p><br><p>“Hah. Yeah, it’s just as incomprehensible as mine, but it suits her abilities, the kind of Phantom she is.”</p><br><br><p>“If you don’t mind, what do you think is your most difficult condition? What is it called?”</p><br><p>Adam looked at Louis for a moment, wondering if he should answer.</p><br><p>“That’s my biggest problem, Louis.”</p><br><br><p>“I’m not even sure if it’s the most difficult, but I’ll answer, it’s the Blood of God. And I have no idea where to get it.”</p>
