            <br><p>Earlier, on the battlefield inside the purple flame ring, the black and blue flashes fought to get a chance to capture the white flash - Midnight Crystal.</p><br><p>But... after literally descending from the sky, losing one clash but quickly returning with renewed strength, they were joined by a new flash - an amber one. Despite its calm, noble color, the amber flash was the most aggressive and wild, like a true beast unleashed from its chains.</p><br><br><p>Nessa's long claws slashed into the black blade, releasing outward cascades of sparks flying before Plague Reaper's focused eyes.</p><br><p>He quickly set the bone hilt to strike before glancing at the blade of his weapon, in the reflection, he saw a silver needle coming straight for his neck.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper narrowed his eyes before turning around sharply, raising a cloud of dust around him with the tip of his foot.</p><br><p>'What the hell...?' Adam internally muttered when a smoke screen appeared in front of the tip of his needle.</p><br><p>A second later, he pierced through the billow of smoke, but Plague Reaper was no longer in that spot.</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could realize anything, a black blade appeared before his eyes, slicing through his chest in a wide sweep.</p><br><p>Neither Katrin's roots nor Osana's airflow could protect Adam from this attack. Plague Reaper's scythe, left a deep cut on his chest, dark blood rushing out, flying in front of Adam's shocked eyes.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper's boot smashed the drops of blood, crashing right into Adam's lost face.</p><br><p>He didn't have time to react or somehow block this attack, taking full damage.</p><br><p>The impact, threw him truly far away, causing him to spin in mid-air, splattering the ground with blood from his broken nose.</p><br><p>The Plague Reaper nodded slightly. It was unclear from his movements, but it was difficult to do something like that, it took all of his mastery to do it. He couldn't allow himself to be trapped between Adam and Nessa, it was too dangerous.</p><br><p>"You piece of shit, look at me!"</p><br><p>Nessa exclaimed furiously, sinking her claws into the Plague Reaper's shoulder.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's coat shuddered vigorously, a jaw emerging from the thick darkness, eager to stop Nessa's claws.</p><br><br><p>The long claws emitting amber streams of energy simply tore the jaw apart, passing through the coat and digging into the Plague Reaper's flesh.</p><br><br><p>For the first time, Plague Reaper let out not a heavy sigh, but a growl filled with vivid pain. Nessa's claws sliced through his flesh, going down quickly, leaving four bloody streaks running from his shoulder to his shoulder blade.</p><br><p>It was a real success for Nessa, but the Plague Reaper wouldn't be able to reach his current level of strength if a simple wound could disable him.</p><br><br><p>Undeterred, Plague Reaper changed his grip and quickly swung his scythe, blocking Nessa's claws.</p><br><p>"You're the second person who dared to look at me with that arrogant gaze..." Nessa said furiously, gritting her teeth.</p><br><p>Her amber eyes with vertical pupils were burning Plague Reaper through. She wanted to tear him apart, she was willing to do whatever it took to do so.</p><br><p>"I'm still pretty pissed at the first one of you, but since he saved my life, I'm definitely not going to kill him." Nessa growled, referring to Adam, "But... You'll be another monster I'll chew to death!"</p><br><p>Suddenly, Nessa stopped using her claws as blades. They were strong and sharp, but not so long that she couldn't clench her hands into fists.</p><br><br><p>Her hands clenched tightly around the bone hilt of the Plague Reaper's weapon. She began to put pressure on the Plague Reaper, about to bring him to the ground.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper fought back, struggling to hold against Nessa's push since entering her fighting form, her physical strength far exceeded Plague Reaper's capabilities.</p><br><br><p>Nessa stomped her foot, using the ground as her base. Her muscles emitted hot steam, straining to the limit.</p><br><br><p>Eventually, Plague Reaper couldn't stand, his legs shaking, betraying him and dooming him to fall.</p><br><p>As soon as his back touched the cold ground, Nessa's jaw began to close in front of him. Sharp fangs strove to reach their target, which was very near.</p><br><p>Then, Plague Reaper's eyes went wide, realizing that just a little more and Nessa would just rip his face off!</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's hands trembled, Nessa pressing harder and harder using her superior position.</p><br><p>With each heartbeat, scythe's hilt moved closer to Plague Reaper's chest as well as Nessa's jaw, like a wild piranha seeing its prey.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper growled, plunging his feet into Nessa's steel abs. Despite the force of the kick, Nessa flew only a few meters away, quickly doing a somersault in the air and standing confidently on her feet.</p><br><p>Nessa was ready to attack again, but the Plague Reaper was no longer going to let her get too close to him.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's mouth opened slightly as if he were going to whistle, but instead of whistling, a large amount of black air came out. It was like a cloud covering everything ahead, moving quickly towards Nessa.</p><br><p>Then, watching their battle, Katrin and Osana realized something. Unlike them and Adam, Nessa was not protected by the wind veil! She had joined their fight quite late, and Osana simply didn't have a chance to protect her. Explore more stories at empire</p><br><p>"NO! Run away! Dodge!" Osana exclaimed, realizing that they couldn't lose Nessa because of such a stupid mistake.</p><br><p>Nessa threw a scornful look at her, but she didn't move away, she didn't take a single step out of her seat at all.</p><br><p>"Run away? Do you really think I'm afraid of this air? Even if it is deadly, I just need to get rid of this cloud of death!" Nessa snorted before opening her mouth wide, taking a deep breath.</p><br><p>Her lungs expanded, allowing her to suck in an abnormal amount of air. She absorbed all the clean air around her, practically creating a vacuum.</p><br><p>"Agh...? What the hell is she doing?" Katrin tilted her head in a baffled manner.</p><br><p>Osana's eyes went wide when she realized what was going on there.</p><br><br><p>Nessa bent forward, at once letting out all the air. It was like a real storm, sweeping away everything in its path, whether it was black air, dust, or small stones on the ground.</p><br><p>Nessa's breath cleared everything, causing Plague Reaper to cover himself with his hands and lean on his scythe to keep the airflow from blowing him away.</p><br><p>Magnus, watching this, chuckled evilly.</p><br><p>"Hehehe, good, she's getting better at realizing how her inadequate physical strength can be used."</p>
