            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1344: It’s Not That Simple (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>The Knight of the White Spire had an important but rather simple job — he had to make sure that any contender wishing to enter the Silver Beacon was worthy of it.</p><br><p>It wasn’t just about strength, through the silver wing signs, he could become much stronger than most of the contenders who had come here throughout history.</p><br><p>Often, those who passed through the barrier were unable to impress the knight, and they had to return. The particularly stubborn ones even faced a deadly outcome.</p><br><p>However… this was one of those rare occasions when the knight underestimated a contender, not a great monster but a young man who seemed simple at first glance.</p><br><br><p>With a clap of thunder, the thunderbolt struck the knight, leaving him no chance of an equal fight.</p><br><p>In fact, Adam did not hold back his strength, and the power of his attack could have been enough to wound or even kill the knight.</p><br><p>However, fortunately for the knight, he was not the strongest creature at the Silver Beacon. Perhaps that was his salvation.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s eyes reflected a bright light as the barrier covered the knight, throwing Adam aside and preventing the thunderbolt from striking the knight with its full force.</p><br><p>Adam wasn’t ready for this, but he landed on his feet with ease, watching intently as the electrical discharges ran through the knight’s frame, heading towards the ground where their power dissipated.</p><br><p>The knight could have continued to attack, especially after he had become stronger through the silver wing sign, but it was obvious to everyone that there was no point in doing so.</p><br><p>Adam had won, and the knight was only alive because someone had protected him. That was all.</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam looked toward the white gate.</p><br><p>“I understand that I can move on, right? Although if you want to fight again, I’m ready.”</p><br><p>Deep down, the knight wanted to respond to this challenge and show what he was really capable of, but that would have been a pathetic attempt to hide his failure and nothing more.</p><br><p>“No.” The knight shook his head. “I have no intention of fighting you to the death and turning this place into a battlefield. I disagree with your judgments, but everyone is entitled to their opinion.”</p><br><br><p>“Everyone, or only those who are strong enough?”</p><br><p>The knight frowned but did not respond.</p><br><p>Instead, he pointed his axe toward the gate.</p><br><p>“You should channel your bold energy in a different direction to prove not only to me but to my lady that you are worthy of being here and getting what you want.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply. He could joke about the knight all he wanted, but the real deal was at the Silver Beacon, and only there could he obtain the Desire of Beyond. At least in his case, that was the best option.</p><br><p>“I see. Well, I hope the next time we meet, you will be stronger.” Adam shrugged and headed for the gate.</p><br><p>“Pfffft!” The knight snorted. “Why? My strength is enough to serve my mistress. As long as I can fulfill my duties, I am completely satisfied with my state.”</p><br><p>However, Adam didn’t believe his words for a moment.</p><br><p>“Even though your helmet hides your face, your words are enough for me to understand that you are lying, or simply don’t believe your own words.”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes deepened as he placed his palm on the gate.</p><br><p>“Everyone has ambitions, me, your mistress, and you included. Your words will not change how you truly feel. I think you understand that well.”</p><br><p>Before the knight could respond, Adam opened the gate as a bright, white light engulfed him, leaving the knight alone in the snow-white field.</p><br><p>It is unknown how long it will be before Adam leaves the Silver Beacon and when the next contender will arrive to challenge the knight.</p><br><br><p>Instead of his usual upright stance, the knight collapsed to the ground, with a deep, slightly sad look in his eyes.</p><br><p>He did not expect that a young man who had lived several times less than he would be able to put him in such a position.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Adam finally managed to get to the Silver Beacon, or at least so it seemed to him.</p><br><p>“W-What?” Adam gulped in disbelief. “Where the hell am I?”</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam thought he had closed his eyes and entered his inner space, because everything around him was empty.</p><br><p>However, in his inner space, everything was endless darkness with his Evolution Tree and Path Construct in the center, but here everything was white.</p><br><p>After a few moments, the outlines of platforms appeared in the emptiness in front of Adam, wanting to guide him forward. They looked as if they had been there from the beginning, and the outlines simply helped Adam notice them.</p><br><p>‘Hmm…’ Adam hummed as his gaze turned downward. ‘There’s nothing beneath me, but I’m not falling even though I’m not using energy. This is actually very similar to my inner space.’</p><br><p>Adam could just stand and look around for hours, but until he took a step forward, nothing would change.</p><br><p>‘I expected to meet the Silver Beacon right away. It seems she has a human form just like Lone Blaze, and… the knight said she has a name. How curious.</p><br><br><p>Without rushing, Adam moved forward as the platforms shook slightly with each step he took. As soon as he stepped onto the next platform, the previous one disappeared, showing that there was no way back.</p><br><p>However, Adam had no intention of running away. He had gone too far.</p><br><p>He didn’t have to wait long. After just a minute, he saw the outline of a tall object, completely white but with black edges, just like the platforms.</p><br><p>In some ways, it looked a lot like an elevator, but not the usual kind.</p><br><p>Standing next to the doors was a short girl with short black hair and large eyes. She was dressed like a hotel manager and looked at Adam with an appropriate gaze.</p><br><p>“Adam Vinter. I’m glad you finally made it here. I hope you’re ready to go beyond your limits to achieve what you want.”</p>
