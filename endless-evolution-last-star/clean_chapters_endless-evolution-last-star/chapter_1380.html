            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1380: Black Dress</strong></p><br><p>Adam learned a lot about himself and his new ability, which took the form of the Silver Weaver.</p><br><p>But he had to move on. He went through another battle and won, albeit with great difficulty. Now, he had only one condition left to fulfill to create the Second Grand Star.</p><br><p>“Are you leaving already?” The Silver Weaver asked with a detached look.</p><br><p>Adam nodded. “Yeah. Even though I found the Desire of Beyond, I don’t think my mission on this island is over.”</p><br><br><br><p>The Silver Weaver looked away.</p><br><p>“Before you leave, there’s something else I need to show you. I’m sure you’ve sensed it, but you think it’s all about increased energy. In fact, there have been many bigger changes in one place.”</p><br><p>True, Adam guessed what the Silver Weaver was talking about, but decided to wait anyway.</p><br><br><p>Just a few moments later, quiet footsteps could be heard from the side, footsteps that betrayed a sense of uncertainty.</p><br><p>“What the…” Adam’s jaw dropped to the floor as he stared at Lone Blaze, or rather at the changes that had taken place in her.</p><br><p>The sparse, lonely white hairs were now replaced by thick curls among her flaming head, indicating a deeper connection between her and Adam.</p><br><p>But what really caught his attention was her dress. Now, its edges were black, although most of it was still white, emitting a bright flame with each step she took.</p><br><p>Since she was the External Artifact that had contracted with Adam and lived in his Initial Gene, any changes in her appearance were reflected in her abilities and energy.</p><br><p>“Hello, Adam… As you can see, I’ve changed a bit since we last met.”</p><br><p>Adam frowned as he stared at the Silver Weaver.</p><br><p>“You did this, didn’t you?”</p><br><p>“I didn’t control the process.” The Silver Weaver waved his hand. “I just started it. If it weren’t for me, it would have happened in a few days or weeks anyway. Lone Blaze would have had to adapt to the new energy in the space somehow. I helped her, nothing more.”</p><br><p>The cold but clear answer both annoyed and satisfied Adam.</p><br><br><p>Adam snorted and turned to Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>“Don’t worry. You look better than ever. Now you control not only flame and light, but also darkness. It can only be described as majestic.”</p><br><p>Lone Blaze blushed but quickly regained her composure.</p><br><p>“Thank you. There have been some changes in my abilities. I’m sure you’ll need them, but I don’t advise you to use them right now since you’re—”</p><br><br><p>The Silver Weaver’s harsh voice made Lone Blaze’s eyes widen.</p><br><p>“W-Wait! That’s not what I meant to say—!”</p><br><p>“Pffft!” The Silver Weaver mocked Adam. “Do you think I’m wrong? He used part of my ability and immediately fell to the ground. He’s not only weak but also an idiot. He doesn’t understand that he needs to rest first before he can understand the power hidden in my and your abilities.”</p><br><p>Lone Blaze had nothing to say. By nature, she always treated Adam with courtesy and respect. She understood that she was not Adam’s equal. She was his loyal assistant and had sworn allegiance to him when they signed their contract.</p><br><p>But that contract was exactly what Adam needed.</p><br><p>“Hahahahahaha!” Adam laughed, slapping his knee. “You arrogant bastard! I just wanted to see my new abilities, that’s all! Although you’re right, hah, I’m surprised my wounds didn’t open up.”</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver shrugged and disappeared, returning to the Desire Gene. Lone Blaze bowed low and left as well.</p><br><p>After a few moments of silence, Adam soared into the darkness and closed his eyes.</p><br><p>“What do you think about that?” He asked.</p><br><p>[That’s great… That power suits you much better than the dark snake that lived in your inner space for a while…]</p><br><p>“Ah, you’re talking about Moira?” Adam remembered her, the monster he had saved as the Crimson Monarch’s last wish. “Yeah, that’s right. Well, I did everything I could for her. She shouldn’t have been part of my power in the first place.”</p><br><br><p>Adam took a few steps toward the darkness.</p><br><p>“Moira, huh? I wonder where she is now and if she’s even alive? At the time of our last meeting, she was far from the Crimson Monarch’s level.”</p><br><p>Shaking his head, Adam returned to the real world where, grumbling like an old man, he got to his feet, deciding not to use any abilities for the time being.</p><br><p>“Argh. If our fight had been any tougher, I would have died right here!”</p><br><p>Adam might have continued complaining if something hadn’t caught his attention.</p><br><br><p>The runes carved into the ruins flashed with a dim purple light as darkness gathered in the orb above the platform.</p><br><p>A chill ran down Adam’s spine, as this was exactly how his battle against the Silver Weaver had begun. He was proud of how it had ended, but he would never want to go through something like that again.</p><br><p>However, his apprehension quickly dissipated.</p><br><p>[Should I congratulate you, young man…?]</p><br><p>“You… Are you part of the White Spire?”</p><br><p>[Yes… I spoke with you at the beginning of the trial, and now… I watched your battle. You did everything right… Although… your fight was cruel and bloody… an impressive sight…]</p><br><p>In response, Adam only smiled bitterly and shook his head.</p><br><p>[I see… So you understand that too…?]</p><br><p>“Sure. It took me some time, but I reached the Desire of Beyond as soon as I found myself under the dark dome, didn’t I?”</p><br><p>Adam sighed deeply, remembering his battle against the Silver Weaver.</p><br><p>“Everything else was just a process for me to accept and understand my new power. You didn’t lie to me. I really did get what I wanted.”</p><br><p>[Such would have been the will of the White Spire, if it were still in our world.]</p><br><br><p>In response, the dark orb moved toward the gray tower.</p><br><p>[You have passed all the trials and more… Go to the tower… The Silver Beacon… Bertrada… She is arrogant, but she follows the rules because she knows what the consequences will be… She will reward you with distant lands and return you to where you came from…]</p><br><p>After a few moments, the dark orb continued.</p><br><p>[I do not advise you to go beyond the borders of the island… It is too dangerous for someone like you, even now, you are not strong enough.]</p><br>
