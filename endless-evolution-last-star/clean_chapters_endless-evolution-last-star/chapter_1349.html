            <h4>Chapter 1349: Hunter’s Dagger (Part 1)</h4><br><p>Adam didn’t often encounter situations where his opponent was significantly stronger than he was. It wasn’t just that winning would be difficult, to win in this case was simply impossible with his current level of power.
</p><br><p>Sure, the Silver Gargoyle was incomparable to Misty, Karso, or even Narica. However, it was still too early for Adam to fight against the Lords, even if they were the weakest of them.
</p><br><p>Still... If he couldn’t kill the Silver Gargoyle on his own, that didn’t mean he had no chance of winning.
</p><br><p>Whooosh. Whoooosh. Whoooosh.
</p><br><p>Like a gust of wind, Adam jumped from one island to another, occasionally stopping on floating rocks to plan his next move.
</p><br><p>The Silver Gargoyle did everything in its power to kill Adam, but thanks to the Dual Resonance and the massive amounts of energy flowing through his body, he was fast enough to dodge every deadly ray.
</p><br><p>In the last few minutes, Adam had covered about 50% of all the rocks. Unfortunately, Silvana’s theory had not proven correct so far, and there was nothing in the bridge either, as the Silver Gargoyle was actively attacking that area as well.
</p><br><p>But Adam was not going to give up until they had checked every area. Sure, he tried to attack the Silver Gargoyle several times, but as he expected, he couldn’t even scratch the monster.
</p><br><p>"Let’s say we’re wrong, then what?" Adam thought as a silver ray reflected in his eyes.
</p><br><p>He rushed to the side, moving to a distant island.
</p><br><p>"Well, even if Silvana is wrong about there being a weapon inside one of the islands, she’s right that the trial must have some kind of solution. We just need to figure out what it is."
</p><br><p>Adam was ready for the next attack from his opponent, but for some reason, the Silver Gargoyle stopped charging its energy ray. He felt that it wasn’t about energy. The Silver Gargoyle had enough power for a dozen more shots.
</p><br><p>A few moments later, the corners of Adam’s lips turned up when he realized the reason for this reaction.
</p><br><p>"Oh, I see. It seems you don’t want to destroy either this island or the others around me, right?"
</p><br><p>The Silver Gargoyle didn’t answer, it couldn’t speak, but Adam understood everything from its amber eyes, which had become deeper and angrier.
</p><br><p>’It seems Silvana was right, and if this gargoyle doesn’t want to destroy the islands, then I have to do it, right?’
</p><br><p>Then, he closed his eyes, turning to his partner.
</p><br><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply.
</p><br><p>’Sure, the Imaginary Cut. That should be enough to destroy many rocks and islands at once. Even if these objects are very strong, they won’t be able to withstand the cut.’
</p><br><p>Adam turned to the side, looking at dozens of islands and rocks at the same height, like meteorites in space lined up in a row.
</p><br><p>"Good, then let’s do it."
</p><br><p>It seemed that the Silver Gargoyle understood that very soon it could lose its advantage over Adam.
</p><br><br><p>A furious roar burst from the Silver Gargoyle’s throat, causing a hundred lesser gargoyles to freeze high in the sky. For the first time in the battle, they turned their attention to Adam, not of their own volition but on the orders of the strongest among them.
</p><br><p>"RGHA!" The Silver Gargoyle growled, pointing at Adam with a fiery gaze. It couldn’t kill him quickly enough on its own, but with the help of hundreds of subordinates, it would be an easy task, even if it hurt the monster’s pride.
</p><br><p>Adam looked up when Silvana appeared next to him in her spectral form.
</p><br><p>The multitude of black dots that had previously covered the sky were now moving straight towards them, cutting through the sky with their wide wings.
</p><br><p>"Hah, it’s as if the sky itself is falling on us, right?" Adam smirked, not a hint of panic in his gaze. He knew that sooner or later, the Silver Gargoyle would use the lesser gargoyles to overwhelm him.
</p><br><p>Silvana nodded. "Yes. It’s terrifying, but if you can cut through the sky, you have nothing to worry about."
</p><br><p>"How fortunate that we are about to do just that."
</p><br><p>Seconds before the lesser gargoyles were about to reach them, Adam jumped aside, turning his back to the Silver Gargoyle. He wasn’t afraid that the monster would attack him because he knew that the Silver Gargoyle was too concerned about the safety of the islands ahead.
</p><br><p>"Well, I don’t stand a chance against the Lord, but these weaklings are a different story." Adam’s lips curled upward as the silhouette of the great scissors appeared in front of him.
</p><br><p>Before the lesser gargoyles could change their trajectory and get out of the way, Adam and Silvana grabbed the handles of the scissors tightly before closing them, causing the blades to snap together with a loud click.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, a barely noticeable blade with a purple hue shot forward, cutting through everything in its path.
</p><br><p>Even the Silver Gargoyle flinched, flying back a little, although it was quite far from the area of effect.
</p><br><p>The lesser gargoyles were not so lucky, and all they saw was a faint glint before their bodies were cut to pieces.
</p><br><p>For some, it was a clean cut across the torso, for others it was diagonal, but the result was the same—one slash ended the lives of dozens or even a hundred gargoyles.
</p><br><p>Streams of blood, severed wings, and limbs fell into the void, but this grim scene was not what Adam was looking for as his gaze moved further, toward the islands.
</p><br><p>His eyes darted from one rock to another, trying to find anything resembling a weapon among the destroyed islands and rocks.
</p><br><p>Gradually, the frown on Adam’s face became more pronounced, and Silvana looked the same. Neither of them could see anything useful.
</p><br><p>"Tsk, looks like it’s a failure." Silvana bit her lip. "We need to try another area, or my theory was just a theory from the beginning."
</p><br><p>Then... Adam’s pupils narrowed.
</p><br><p>"No, you were right."
</p><br><p>He stared directly at the rough, dusty handle peeking out from a floating fragment of one of the islands.
</p><br><p>The weapon capable of killing the invincible enemy was right in front of him.</p>
