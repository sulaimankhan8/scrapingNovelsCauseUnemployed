            <br><br><p>Adam took a step forward before instantly finding himself in front of the Solitary Commander. It happened so quickly that the Solitary Commander had no time to react before Adam’s fist was in front of his face.
</p><br><br><p>Crushing the protective scales like sheets of soft metal, Adam’s fist plunged into the Solitary Commander’s face, knocking the tall monster aside.
</p><br><p>However, unlike Adam, much smaller and shorter than the Solitary Commander, the monster managed to stay on his feet, slipping back a few meters. Its legs clad in armor left two black lines on the ground.
</p><br><p>The Solitary Commander quickly looked up, ignoring the bright pain and blood flowing from his nose - he realized that things were much more serious now.
</p><br><br><p>Yet, before he could see Adam, several bright flashes of pain appeared on his body, Adam’s fists continued to pound, leaving dents in the monster’s single crimson armor.
</p><br><p>"Grha!" The Solitary Commander growled, swinging his spear.
</p><br><p>Adam’s right eye glowed brightly, the amber grid allowing him to see what was beyond the Solitary Commander’s reach.
</p><br><br><p>Crouching at the last moment, Adam ended up behind the Solitary Commander, his arms wrapped around the monster’s waist as tightly as if he wanted to break its spine.
</p><br><p>The Solitary Commander abruptly turned around going to get rid of Adam’s grip, but it was already too late.
</p><br><p>"You’re heavy, but that’s no problem for me!"
</p><br><p>Gritting his teeth, Adam lifted The Solitary Commander off the ground, throwing the monster over himself.
</p><br><br><p>The Solitary Commander crashed into the ground headfirst, smashing the slab with his face, his long horns sinking deep into the stone.
</p><br><p>Silvana shuddered as she watched the scene, yet she felt happy for Adam since he hadn’t been able to use such a technique before, it was just a part of what he carried with him after a long training.
</p><br><br><p>The crimson spear erupted in hot flames, melting the slabs beneath it, the heat growing stronger reaching Adam’s skin.
</p><br><p>"Hah, looks like someone’s pissed off, but I haven’t even started yet!" Adam exclaimed in excitement, turning around sharply.
</p><br><p>Before the spear could reach its maximum power, Adam stomped at the Solitary Commander’s back, pressing the monster into the ground.
</p><br><p>Then, like a bloodthirsty shadow, Adam’s hands gripped Solitary Commander’s arm tightly, pulling it upward.
</p><br><p>"Maybe I can’t cut or thrust you, but... I can break you."
</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam pulled Solitary Commander’s arm to the side.
</p><br><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.
</p><br><p>With a loud crunch, the monster’s arm broke in several places, from the shoulder, elbow, and all the way down to the wrist. Adam made sure it was as painful and devastating as possible. Stay tuned to NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>The Solitary Commander’s eyes opened wide in vivid pain, he gasped, but with the last of his strength, he managed not to growl in agony.
</p><br><br><p>A bright flash emanated from the spear as the Solitary Commander raised his weapon, bringing the blade down to the ground.
</p><br><p>The flaming blast threw Adam aside, but he didn’t move too far away, shielding himself from the light with his hand.
</p><br><p>Breathing heavily from the strain he’d been through, the Solitary Commander rose to his feet. His left arm dangled from side to side, turning from a powerful weapon into a leather sack of bones.
</p><br><br><p>Adam spread his arms to the side, seeing the slightest movement of his opponent.
</p><br><p>"Is that all you can do when your armor becomes useless?"
</p><br><p>The Solitary Commander snorted, unwilling to admit that bare fists were more effective against him than a sharp needle, though that wasn’t entirely true.
</p><br><p>If Adam didn’t have his great physical strength, he wouldn’t be able to even bend the Solitary Commander’s arm, let alone break it, bringing it to such a terrible state.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>A slight shiver passed through the ground, from the Solitary Commander whose horns began to fill with light.
</p><br><p>"Hah, I knew you’d use them. You know, I’ve seen what Essence Thunder Demon’s horns were capable of."
</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly.
</p><br><p>"Sure, given the level difference, you should be considerably stronger. After all, you’re a Mid Yellow monster, but..."
</p><br><p>Then, for a brief period, his eyes lost their light, becoming darker and cruel.
</p><br><p>"Will you manage to impress me Solitary Commander?"
</p><br><p>The Solitary Commander couldn’t speak, but he didn’t need words to answer Adam’s question.
</p><br><p>As with humans, actions were more than enough than empty words.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Blue flashes traveled along the horns, turning into a tiny flaming orb, aimed directly at Adam, who as the perfect target stood motionless.
</p><br><p>"ROOOOOOOAAAAAAGGHHH!"
</p><br><p>With a furious roar, the Solitary Commander attacked.
</p><br><p>The orb exploded, unleashing a powerful stream of flame, amplified by the dense irregular energy and power given to him from the fortress.
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes grew wide for a moment as his dark silhouette disappeared in the bright firelight.
</p><br><p>The flames were hot enough to melt half the area, not even the materials of the fortress were able to withstand such pure, destructive power.
</p><br><p>However... it didn’t matter how strong the blast was. If it didn’t hit its target, it was meaningless.
</p><br><br><p>A shadow appeared in front of the Solitary Commander, the monster’s shocked eyes cast downward.
</p><br><p>Adam’s face was as calm as his eyes, which reflected a long blade that didn’t belong to him.
</p><br><p>After a moment, the Solitary Commander realized that Adam was firmly holding one of his claws that he had severed at the beginning of the fight.
</p><br><p>"Sorry, but this is the best way to get through your defenses." Adam muttered before swinging the claw from top to bottom.
</p><br><p>The sharp blade split the Solitary Commander’s chest, revealing his purple heart right in the center, it was actively beating protected by sturdy ribs.
</p><br><br><p>Adam’s palm as the deadly spear shattered the ribs into splinters, clenching tightly around the Solitary Commander’s sole heart.
</p><br><p>"That was a good fight and... most likely these wounds will remain for a long time."
</p><br><p>With a slight sadness in his gaze, Adam pulled his hand sharply, ripping Solitary Commander’s heart from his chest.
</p><br><br><p>The Solitary Commander let out one last gasp before collapsing to his knees, his glowing eyes quickly losing their light.
</p><br><br><p>The crimson spear fell from his hand, flying off to the side.
</p><br><p>"Agh... Here it is... the first strong opponent..."
</p><br><p>Immersed in his thoughts, Adam didn’t notice as the crimson spear began to shake, more and more actively, wishing someone to pick it up and grant the artifact’s will.</p>
