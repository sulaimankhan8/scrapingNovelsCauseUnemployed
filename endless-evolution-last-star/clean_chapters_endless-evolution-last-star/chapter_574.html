            <br><br><p>Hundreds of phones trembled with the new alert leading in the purple room. Nobles, influential and rich people, all those who earlier received an invitation from the demonic auctioneer, returned to the purple room to see the second fighter.</p><br><p>Kogen, Baren, Franz, and the rest were no exception.</p><br><p>"Well, well, it looks like this moment is finally here, doesn't it?" Erik smirked, elegantly pulling his phone out of his pocket.</p><br><p>Everyone did the same, except Adam because as a fighter he didn't get an invitation, but he had Silvana who was going to show him everything.</p><br><p>But... among them, there was one other person who hadn't touched his phone.</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Gladius, unlike the others, he continued to enjoy the view with his usual sly smile on his face.</p><br><p>"I guess it's no secret to you, you knew who the second fighter would be a while ago, didn't you?" Adam asked, his gaze calm and deep.</p><br><p>Gladius shrugged, a dangerous gleam running through his eyes.</p><br><p>"Who knows? Maybe unlike you, I want to keep the intrigue for myself and see the other fighter when he enters the arena and not on my phone screen. I'm just appreciating the moment."</p><br><p>Kogen raised an eyebrow, looking at him like an idiot.</p><br><p>"Damn, you're usually a much better liar. Who would even believe that crap?"</p><br><p>Nelya sitting between Franz and Kogen, gulped.</p><br><p>"I would... I won't watch it either." Nelya put her phone aside before she could enter the purple room.</p><br><p>Gladius's corners of his lips went up.</p><br><p>"See? Nelya knows what I'm talking about. You, the head of the great family, should learn from her."</p><br><p>Kogen didn't take Gladius's words seriously, he wasn't that naive and knew a lot more than Nelya.</p><br><p>Erik was looking forward to the arrival of the second fighter more than anyone else, as it meant he could now place a bet, something he thought about hours ago when the demonic auctioneer once again invited him into the purple room.</p><br><p>"Here." Silvana said calmly, showing her phone to Adam.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes moved to the left, looking at the photo of a young man with dark crimson hair and the same as his blue eyes.</p><br><p>"Fromund Aegler..." Adam muttered.</p><br><p>Gladius chuckled, a wicked grin forming on his face.</p><br><p>"What do you think? Based on his gaze and appearance, can you tell how strong he is? Of course, don't forget he's like you K2W0-Phantom, all within the rules."</p><br><p>Adam was silent for a while before nodding deeply. Experience more on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Marzo Family, they're lucky he agreed to work for them, somehow I can feel it. They announced the fighter at the last minute, maybe they did it on purpose, but I think it's because of the hard negotiations."</p><br><p>Silvana nodded in confirmation, looking at Fromund's photo.</p><br><p>"If he was confident enough to put his terms to the great family, then he realized he was a valuable fighter, getting him was no easy task."</p><br><p>Everyone seemed to be happy that Fromund was the second fighter because if he was a worthy opponent then a long and colorful fight on equal footing awaited them.</p><br><p>But, someone didn't share that feeling with the others.</p><br><p>Osana, her legs were crossed at a severe angle just like her arms, she tapped herself on her right shoulder, her face contorted with an annoyed grimace.</p><br><p>"Shit... I thought they'd pick someone from their Branch Squads, but... Fromund Aegler, that name isn't among the Marzo Family's squads." Osana muttered in a low voice.</p><br><p>Gladius shot a look in her direction.</p><br><p>"Did you memorize the names of all the K2W0-Phantoms currently working for the Marzo Family? Impressive, you were prepared for things to get to this stage. Hah, indeed, Osana De Rouzet."</p><br><p>She didn't respond to Gladius's comment in any way.</p><br><p>"Agh..." Osana breathed heavily, "Among all of her men, there was no one more worthy than this one - Fromund Aegler, that's too bad."</p><br><p>Osana closed her eyes.</p><br><p>"I hope he doesn't have some serious motivation and he's only doing this for the reward, otherwise we might be in trouble."</p><br><p>Then, Osana opened her eyes and saw Gladius's smirk meant only for her.</p><br><p>His eyes were narrowed and curved like a demon's, and the corners of his lips lifted high up straining his skin.</p><br><p>Osana gulped, she shuddered in fear.</p><br><p>Gladius didn't need to say anything. After a moment his expression returned to normal, but that was more than enough for Osana to get an answer about Fromund's motivation.</p><br><p>'Fuck...' Osana muttered internally, touching her forehead with her fingertips, her gaze directed downwards, 'Fromund Aegler... why does that name sound so familiar to me? But, there's no way I can remember where I might have heard it...'</p><br><p>Adam saw Osana's reaction but didn't make a big deal of it. He was ready to fight and win, not only because he made a promise to her, but because that was his personal desire.</p><br><p>"I didn't have a single real fight in the last three months..." Adam glared at his hand, clenching his fist tightly.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Erik made his bet, he was one of the first who decided to do so.</p><br><p>"You're still just as impatient, aren't you?" Gladius asked in a sweet voice.</p><br><p>Erik smiled widely, his eyes burning with pleasure.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, of course! Marzo Family... Fuck! They made me wait until the last minute, but I was finally able to place my bet!"</p><br><p>Osana threw a sharp look at him.</p><br><p>"How much did you bet and on whom? I want to know." Osana's voice was hard and cold.</p><br><p>Adam turned in Erik's direction, he too was curious, more about the amount than the fighter.</p><br><p>"Wow, young lady, I don't think that's the proper tone to use when talking to someone older than you and higher in status." Erik replied, shaking his head disapprovingly, "But, given your sensitive situation I will answer, but only part of the question!"</p><br><p>Then, Erik swung his cane, causing his jacket to flutter.</p><br><p>"299.999.999. credits on the outcome that the fight will end with one particular fighter winning!"</p><br><p>Erik exclaimed, spreading his arms out to the sides.</p><br><br><br><p>Fromund slowly descended the rock stairs to the cellar of his house.</p><br><p>He reached forward, opening the old wooden door ready to fall apart on any bad day.</p><br><p>In a small room, a massive case rested against the wall, but... it wasn't black and plain like most Phantoms had.</p><br><p>The case for his Nexus was stone, uneven, and cracked, looking more like part of a forbidden tomb than a weapon sheath.</p>
