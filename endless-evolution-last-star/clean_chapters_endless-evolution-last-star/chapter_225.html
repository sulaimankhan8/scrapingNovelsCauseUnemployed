            <br><p>Silvana, like any personal Operator, was constantly watching what was happening on the battlefield through the camera in Adam's NEP, as well as several small cameras located all over his body.</p><br><p>High technology allowed the small cameras to transmit clear images, of high quality and with no delay at all. However, because it was a technology, it was vulnerable, especially to external electrical influences.</p><br><p>Thus, a second after Thunder Demon pointed his hand at Adam, the images on several screens shuddered as if during a severe disturbance.</p><br><p>"No... If the connection still hasn't been restored, then something very serious has happened!" Silvana muttered worriedly, almost in a panic.</p><br><p>Though she had come to her senses after Adam's words, there was nothing she could do about the fact that she was more worried about Adam than usual.</p><br><p>Obviously, what had happened during the party had affected her more than Adam and more than she realized herself.</p><br><p>"Shit... That's not what I should be thinking about right now..." Silvana clenched her fists tightly, biting her lip, "Adam, has Elemental Root, he couldn't take too much damage from just one attack!"</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>After a few seconds that seemed like an eternity to Silvana, the images on the screens returned to normal, and the first thing Silvana saw was Adam, who burst out of a cloud of dark smoke.</p><br><p>There wasn't much dust in the salt wasteland, so... the black color could only mean that the salt had burned due to the high temperature, leaving this 'scar' on the terrain for a long time.</p><br><p>Adam ran to the side while dark streams of smoke were coming from his shoulders.</p><br><p>"Silvana, what was that?" Adam asked intermittently, trying to hide behind a salt hill from Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>Before answering, which was a mistake in this case, Silvana glanced at Adam to make sure he was okay. Well, he wasn't.</p><br><p>Adam's upper clothing had burned away, exposing his body, which was covered in burns in many places, especially his shoulders and back.</p><br><p>Elemental Root had actually helped Adam withstand the damage, but he could hardly afford to get hit by another attack like that.</p><br><p>"He's most likely using the energy from his core. It won't last long, but at this time he's at his strongest! I don't know what he's capable of, but I'm sure this lightning isn't the worst thing that could happen to you!" Silvana replied quickly.</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a deep look.</p><br><p>Then, he glanced back, looking at Thunder Demon across the salt hill.</p><br><br><p>Oddly enough, Thunder Demon didn't smile this time, for it was as serious as possible - Thunder Demon now had a limited time to kill Adam.</p><br><br><p>Thunder Demon jumped high up, opening his jaw wide.</p><br><p>A second later, from his maw, several compressed lightning orbs flew out like bombs quickly approaching Adam.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, filling with blood as his body instinctively lunged forward instead of backward - yes, he was moving toward the lightning orbs, not away from them.</p><br><p>It was unknown if Adam's mind was keeping up with the lightning-fast actions of his body, but something was certain: it was the right decision.</p><br><br><p>Orbs exploded a few meters behind him, for Thunder Demon knew that Adam would be running away and shot slightly forward to hit Adam accurately. However, this allowed Adam to rush forward and completely dodge the explosions.</p><br><p>Salt waves rose up behind Adam, covering him from the front.</p><br><p>The last thing Adam saw was Thunder Demon approaching the ground after his jump.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, an electric flash, ahead with four sharp claws, cut through the salt cover behind which Adam should be hiding at that instant.</p><br><p>"Rgha...?" Thunder Demon first got a baffled expression on his face as his claws failed to pierce anyone, Adam was no longer at that spot.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon's eyes shifted to the right, only to see Adam and his calm eyes with electric jolts running through them.</p><br><p>Then, a silver gleam appeared, and Adam's silhouette blurred, sweeping across Thunder Demon.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a massive stream of blood rushed from Thunder Demon's shoulder, and a chunk of flesh carved by Adam fell to the ground.</p><br><p>Instinctively, Thunder Demon grabbed his shoulder, trying to take away the pain, but he quickly realized that it was useless. He had other things to do - destroying Adam.</p><br><p>Step. Step. Step. Step.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon, instantly appeared in front of Adam, swinging his paw and bringing it down on Adam's face from the left side like a slap.</p><br><p>With such speed and force, Adam's skin trembled, and then the impact threw him aside, causing him to crash into the salt hill.</p><br><p>But... before Adam could reach his target, Thunder Demon appeared in the middle of the path, abruptly raising his foot and plunging his powerful limb into Adam's stomach, from the bottom to the top.</p><br><p>This attack instantly broke Adam's several ribs and caused him to bleed internally, making a stream of blood gushing from his mouth along with a grimace of pain on his face.</p><br><p>However, the pain and broken ribs were not Adam's biggest problem. There was terror in his wide-open eyes as the Thunder Demon's horns were covered in electric charges.</p><br><p>Adam didn't have wings or any way to move in the air. Moreover, in this open area, there were no suitable objects he could hook onto with his needle.</p><br><p>"NO!" Silvana exclaimed as tears rushed from her eyes. By mistake, her scream was heard by everyone who was then attached to their channel.</p><br><p>Thus, Fred, before whose eyes flew particles of light from the mist arrow, heard it. The arrow was so huge and powerful that his bow was actively shaking as well as his hands.</p><br><p>"Agh... Operators... Even if you try to appear cold and calm, soon you all start to worry about us... Well, not that I'm complaining, but it just makes things more complicated." Fred muttered before releasing the bowstring.</p>
