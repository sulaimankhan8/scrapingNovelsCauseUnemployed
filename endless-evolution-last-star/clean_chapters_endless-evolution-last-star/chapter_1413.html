            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1413: Hybrid’s Power</strong></p><br><p>Anelez often won. This was not surprising, because unlike many monsters in the distant regions of the Tarnished Lands or the Dark Shore, she was not born a Black Threat Level monster.</p><br><p>Moreover, she wasn’t even an Awakened Monster at the beginning of her journey either. She started as a normal monster with a cold, calculating mind, which, thanks to her instincts and a little luck, managed to reach the Awakened stage.</p><br><p>After that, once she had her own mind, consciousness, and speech, a whole new world opened up for a monster like her. She knew her strengths and weaknesses, but what she lacked was the strength and desire that could take control of her in a dangerous moment and save her life.</p><br><p>She could not possibly have the same desire as warriors who loved to fight with all their hearts; that was not her path, but she knew how she could obtain superior instincts. That’s why she decided to take the risk and become an Absolute Type Monster, basically choosing the path of a Monster Hybrid.</p><br><p>Naturally, she was going to defeat Adam in the same way she had defeated all her opponents before. She knew how to wear him down, how to get closer to victory step by step.</p><br><br><p>“What now?!” Adam’s voice echoed in her mind while his lightning bolts tore through space.</p><br><p>She underestimated what kind of opponent Adam was, and that all his abilities only helped him in his desire to go straight at the enemy without fear of the consequences.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s sword plunged straight into Anelez’s shoulder, and the tips of his wings dug into her arms and back, causing bloody trickles.</p><br><p>“GHA!” Blood gushed from Anelez’s mouth as pain reflected on her shocked face.</p><br><p>As quickly as she could, Anelez jumped away from Adam, kicking him in the chest. The sword came out of her shoulder, but then a new wave of pain didn’t bother her. She had to get to a safe distance and realize what had just happened.</p><br><p>‘No! Why did he decide to attack?! What kind of ability is that? How could he be so fast?! Shouldn’t he have tried to escape from my trap?!’</p><br><p>A multitude of questions filled her mind, but she didn’t have time to answer even one of them.</p><br><p>A chill ran down her spine, causing her to turn around as her eyes widened.</p><br><p>Now, Adam hovered high above the ground thanks to the wings of black lightning on his back. His bloodstained sword was now in his left hand. His right arm was raised as if to throw something.</p><br><p>“What is that…?” Anelez stared at the white gloves covering Adam’s hands when, with a bright flash, a snow-white spear with a purple tip and golden trail appeared in his hand.</p><br><p>Without pity in his eyes, Adam threw the white spear.</p><br><br><p>With a speed bordering on the speed of sound, the white spear flew over a hundred meters, ending up right in front of Anelez, who instinctively jumped aside, even though her eyes were glued to the spire.</p><br><br><p>The explosion of white flame threw Anelez to the side. Sharp stones dug into her skin as a trail of dust followed her until she stopped.</p><br><p>With trembling legs, she got up from the ground, holding her head. Blood flowed from her wound, covering her eyebrow.</p><br><p>The first thing she saw was the crater where she had been standing a few seconds ago, then she jerked her head up to meet Adam’s gaze.</p><br><br><p>With a slight tremor, another spire appeared in Adam’s hand. With all her instincts, Anelez felt that this was not Adam’s limit, far from it. His energy was enough to create more than a dozen spires.</p><br><p>Would she be able to dodge them all?</p><br><p>The answer was obvious.</p><br><p>“Fuck…” She croaked. “I’m just a target for him… How… How should I act?”</p><br><p>Anelez was the kind of person who always needed answers to questions. Only then could she understand the situation and make the best decision. She knew it was her flaw, but usually she had more than enough time.</p><br><p>She only needed a few moments, but Adam clearly wasn’t going to give her even that, because the second spire was already flying straight at her.</p><br><br><p>The explosion covered part of the silent expanse and became the first critical moment for both the fight and the spectators.</p><br><p>“Oh.” Helasa raised an eyebrow. “It seems this girl isn’t as strong as you said.”</p><br><p>No new emotions appeared on Xander’s face.</p><br><p>“Adam has put her in a difficult position. I’m sure panic will consume Anelez very soon.”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Helasa tilted her head. “You don’t seem very upset.”</p><br><p>“Is there any reason to be?”</p><br><p>He turned as his deep eyes stared at her.</p><br><p>“Any Hybrid, even one as cold-minded as Anelez, is first and foremost a beast. Only when a beast finds itself in a desperate situation does the real fight begin. Now, Anelez will be nothing more than a cornered beast who has no intention of losing.”</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam hovered in the air, surveying the battlefield.</p><br><p>Anelez lay in the center of the second crater. A thick layer of blood covered her body from multiple open wounds.</p><br><p>Her breathing was ragged, and her fingertips trembled as she tried to get up from the ground, but to no avail.</p><br><p>Anelez’s eyes were wide open as if she couldn’t believe she had ended up in such a dire situation so quickly.</p><br><br><p>Is that all? – The question was reflected on his face.</p><br><p>With a tremble, he created a third spire, preparing to throw it.</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble!</p><br><p>It was not the earth that trembled, but Anelez’s aura, which, instead of a calm flow, became an unstable storm.</p><br><p>The blood covering her body began to boil as if in a hot cauldron, while the edges of the crater charred, filling with smoldering embers.</p><br><p>The ground beneath Anelez quickly melted, and the air became shaky, blurring her figure.</p><br><p>Confusion was reflected on Adam’s face as he hurried and made his throw.</p><br><p>The third spire was supposed to end their fight, but neither of them was sure anymore.</p><br><br><p>With a bright flash, a stream of flame burst from Anelez with such force that it completely engulfed Adam’s spire, reducing it to nothing.</p><br><p>Adam bit his lip, realizing what had just happened.</p><br><p>“Solar Form…” He muttered. “She used it after all.”</p>
