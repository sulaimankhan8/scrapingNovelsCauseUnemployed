            <br><p>Unlike Adam, everyone thought the plan was going well.</p><br><p>At the Magma Plateau it wasn't just Adam and Risha who trained. Torz, Grita, Heret and Vorx were often here as resistance leaders, but from time to time other serpents came here.</p><br><p>Sure, it was impossible for them to use the dark field because of the immense pressure and generally stay at the Radiant Mirage's domain for a long time, but dense energy was always a valuable resource for any monster.</p><br><p>Naturally, ten days was a long time in their situation. Every day was important because once the Light Legion arrived at the scarlet cliff, they would have to move into battle.</p><br><p>For the same reason, Heret and Vorx discussed a plan of action. Each day, the rebels worked together at a faster and faster pace, making an effort not to be noticed by the Light Legion.</p><br><p>Other serpents that were not part of the resistance received information through secret channels. Even if they didn't take the risk of training, they were ready to fight against Arnoth's reign when the time was right.</p><br><p>It wasn't without difficulties, but the process went smoothly.</p><br><p>The whole plan hinged on the serpents and their allies being strong enough to revolt and overthrow Arnoth and Kreyna to avenge their slain comrades for king and queen.</p><br><p>They hoped that by the last day, they would have that power.</p><br><br><p>Adam didn't agree. He like Vorx had his own plans, one of which included Risha and Radiant Mirage.</p><br><p>However, he was the core of the operation. He was the Phantom who defeated Vorx and had to move on to the next stage to face a great enemy like Arnoth.</p><br><p>Could he accomplish that?</p><br><p>The answer was simple.</p><br><br><p>Perhaps, if Adam would have stuck to the plan and continued to charge the fourth lesser gates, he would have succeeded, but he didn't believe in it.</p><br><p>The energy flows left cracks in the fourth lesser gates a few days ago, but it was hardly possible to achieve more significant results.</p><br><p>Adam frowned, stepping forward.</p><br><p>'The Evolution Tree said that I must break through the barrier myself. No cracks or energy flows will help me with that. So... Why did I even listen to them and waste my time on this?'</p><br><br><p>Torz's voice boomed out as he headed forward, glaring menacingly at Adam. In his monster form, he was slightly smaller than Vorx but still an intimidating serpent capable of unleashing flames on his enemy.</p><br><p>"Don't mind me," Adam said coldly as he continued forward. "You and Grita must continue your practice with Risha. She must grow stronger."</p><br><p>"Argh?" Torz grunted in outrage. "You think you're strong enough to give us demands? You have to go back to the dark field right now!"</p><br><p>In a burst of anger, Torz was about to say something else, but... Adam disappeared.</p><br><p>In the blink of an eye, Adam appeared above Torz, as a white star flashed in his left fist, the energy from the Global Gene compressed to the limit becoming dense and palpable.</p><br><br><p>At full power, Adam's fist descended upon Torz's head.</p><br><p>The impact sealed the serpent into the ground, the scales shattering the crystals into tiny fragments as a shudder ran through the entire Magma Plateau. However, nothing went out of bounds.</p><br><br><p>Adam landed on the ground next to Torz, dark trickles of blood running along his large eyes.</p><br><p>"You... How...? What kind of power is that?"</p><br><p>In response, Adam strode past, clutching tightly the crimson sword of his power gene, his intimidating cape fluttering.</p><br><p>"You should thank me that I didn't use that sword, or else..." his tone deepened. "Your head would be on the ground by now, away from your slippery body."</p><br><p>Grita and Risha gulped, their faces turning as pale as sheets of paper.</p><br><p>Neither of them made any attempt to stop Adam, they realized it was beyond their power.</p><br><p>'So he didn't even use half of his powers then?' Risha muttered inwardly, looking at the crimson sword. 'That sword... He could use it the first time we fought.'</p><br><p>She shuddered. 'Fuck... If he wanted to kill me right away, he could do it. I'm lucky he decided not to spend all his trump cards at once. Otherwise, even my brother wouldn't manage to save me.''</p><br><p>Unlike the frightened Grita, there was excitement in Risha's eyes. She wanted to see what Adam was capable of when he used all his trump cards.</p><br><p>'Come on... Show me this. Maybe I'll finally realize the difference between us.'</p><br><br><p>Vorx and Heret exchanged glances and stepped forward.</p><br><p>"Adam," Vorx narrowed his eyes. "It seems no words will stop you. I don't think you're right, but there's no other choice. We will fight against you. In what forms shall we be?"</p><br><br><p>"What form will you be strongest in?"</p><br><p>Pensive, Vorx frowned, scratching his chin.</p><br><p>"Considering your strength and the fact that this is a 2 vs. 1, we will have the advantage if we stay in human form. Otherwise, you'll defeat us through speed, gradually wounding us, and we won't be able to counter you because of our size."</p><br><p>"Good, then it's settled," Adam nodded deeply, quickening his step.</p><br><p>Heret and Vorx had a few seconds to prepare.</p><br><p>Flames covered their hands, and their vertical pupils narrowed, pushing their instincts to the limit.</p><br><p>They were experienced fighters and realized that they could not defeat Adam with flame blasts or tail swipes.</p><br><p>It was a fast enemy that needed the same measures against it and, most importantly - durability. They could defeat small and weak enemies, be they monsters or Phantoms, in single attacks, but Adam showed that he was above that.</p><br><p>"Well..." Heret muttered, leaning forward. "It's been a while since you and I fought together against the Phantoms."</p><br><p>Vorx grinned widely. "Yeah, only last time there were five of them and only two of us. Yet, we won!"</p><br><br><p>Heret's gaze grew darker, his eyes reflecting Adam's silhouette engulfed in white fire.</p><br><p>"I don't have the same confidence in victory now as I did that day."</p>
