            <br><p>The eclipses were dangerous not only because of the random waves of monsters but also because even the laziest and most leisurely but powerful monsters were motivated enough to come out of their lairs and spring into action.</p><br><p>Rarely were such monsters loners, and even if they were, there were plenty of monsters among the waves willing to follow them.</p><br><p>Joining someone strong was always the right decision for the weaker ones. Absorbing all the energy and the External Artifact was impossible for them, but in this configuration, they could hope for a piece of meat from the massive table during the feast.</p><br><p>One of these monsters made a decision faster than the others and already appeared on the horizon line, watching the massive fortress from the hilltops.</p><br><p>The first leader appeared from the northern side, its tall silhouette slowly rising leading hundreds of monsters not daring to challenge its authority.</p><br><p>Katrin narrowed her eyes, scrutinizing the monster.</p><br><p>"Alan, what kind of bastard is that? It's very different from the others."</p><br><p>The reply followed immediately:</p><br><p>'It's a Prime Grim Warro. Be careful, their Prime Type versions are much stronger than the normal ones as the chances of them appearing are very slim.'</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The black branches lightly trembled, covering Grim Warro's entire lean body. The Grim Warro had no flesh or blood, remotely resembling a reanimated sinister tree, but he was much larger.</p><br><p>The Grim Warro's arms and legs like his torso were thin but very long, his hands and feet were broad with long fingers, the tips were pointed roots, deadly blades capable of piercing through any armor.</p><br><p>From the broad shoulders, compared to the narrow chest, came an elongated neck, the twisted roots covering this important area, moving to the head of the dangerous monster.</p><br><p>The Grim Warro's head was like a demon coming out of the underworld, its wide maw was ajar, sharp branches were his fangs, and from the depths of his throat came a green glow.</p><br><p>From time to time, flashes of emerald flame burst out, sweeping before his eyes, clots of green fire that would not stop burning even if Grim Warro lost his head.</p><br><p>Katrin eyed the monsters, Grim Warro was considerably larger than ordinary humans in size, but it was hard to call him a giant.</p><br><p>"Big bastard... But, Alan, you didn't say what threat level it is?"</p><br><p>After a few seconds of silence, Alan replied:</p><br><p>'Katrin, please don't engage him without support. Prime Grim Warro are rated as Mid Yellow Threat monsters, but they are above the medium stage.'</p><br><p>Her gaze became darker as she nodded deeply. The fact that a monster was higher than medium stage meant that in its level, more than half of the monsters were rated weaker than this particular monster.</p><br><p>For example, if there were only a hundred monsters in the Mid Yellow Threat Level, then all the monsters from Top-49 to Top-1 would be rated higher than the medium stage. The difference could be significant, as Top-40 and Top-10 monsters had completely different strengths, but this monster was not weaker than monsters below Top-50. Find your next read on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>The monsters in the Mid Yellow range were much more than a hundred, their rankings were constantly changing, but the acquired danger always remained in the database.</p><br><p>"I see. Well, before he gets here it will be a while and he's weaker than the Dormant Lord, the one I'm really worried about is him."</p><br><br><p>Prime Grim Warro took a few wide steps forward, slowly descending the hill. Despite his impressive height, Grim Warro weighed very little, his long legs and arms giving the illusion that he was massive, but this was a monster relying on his agility and energy rather than brute physical force.</p><br><br><p>Tilting his head at a strange angle, the Grim Warro pointed his gaze straight at Katrin, even though there were several kilometers between them.</p><br><p>Yet, he didn't spend too much time on her, like all monsters he saw the starfall, and its aftermath still covered the Lands of the Lone Serpent.</p><br><p>Unbroken shells, the white-purple crystals were in different parts, no one dared to approach them for fear of being destroyed by failure.</p><br><p>A wide grin covered the Grim Warro's face as he laughed briefly with each breath releasing streams of flame.</p><br><p>An idea had come to him that he couldn't refuse, his curiosity and pride were his main enemies and allies.</p><br><br><p>The Grim Warro brought his hands to the ground, the sharp tips sinking into the sand reaching the soil hidden deep beneath the dense layers. His fingers, long roots headed forward, passing beneath the ground with intentions known only to him.</p><br><p>After a short period, the ground shook, sending an active tremor throughout the area.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A multitude of roots emerged from beneath the sand like saplings, but they sought not the light of the sun, but the dense energy of the crystals, slowly wrapping themselves around them like vines.</p><br><p>Katrin's eyes narrowed, she realized that the Grim Warro wanted to absorb the energy from the crystals since he had an easy, safe option, but she didn't know for what.</p><br><p>"What's that overgrown root going to do? If it's preparing for an attack, it's useless, the archers and us will beat it back, moreover, it doesn't look like it possesses powerful long-range abilities."</p><br><p>Oddly enough, the answer to that was not known by Alan, nor even the archers who were keeping a close eye on the potential threat.</p><br><p>The Grim Warro, especially the Prime One, was a monster who followed his emotions and desires rather than logic and cold calculation.</p><br><p>Since what he was about to do was not a plus for him, as it was for monsters or Phantoms.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>From the north side, many massive roots quickly appeared between the Grim Warro and the fortress. In just a few seconds, they transformed into a huge black tree, its crown was open holding a green flaming orb.</p><br><p>"Rghaaaaa! Rghaaa! Rghaaa!"</p><br><p>A ghastly laugh emitted from the Grim Warro's throat as his eyes flashed with renewed vigor.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a beam of wide flames burst out from the black tree, reaching the heavens.</p><br><p>This action had only one effect: attracting attention, for the beam was far greater than the starfall or the light blast of the Blinding Sylphyre.</p><br><p>Any monster not restricted by the horizon line could see the green flame light, an invitation to a blood feast.</p>
