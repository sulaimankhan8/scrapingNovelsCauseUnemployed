            <br><p>Adam was surprised to see the crystal knight like the others. He was ready to fight as Risha, but Lone Blaze's voice stopped him.</p><br><p>Unlike the baffled Phantoms, it was obvious to her what was going on. After all, she and the Radiant Mirage were of the same kind.</p><br><br><p>With a white pulse carrying a shuddering veil behind him, Adam found himself in a mirror world. All he saw around were countless mirrors and floating fragments.</p><br><p>Instead of the darkness that filled his inner space, it was bright here, but there was no sun or any source of light, although white rays reflected off the mirrored surfaces.</p><br><br><p>No sooner had Adam gotten used to the blinding light than two shards flew toward him, aiming at his neck like sharp blades.</p><br><p>The flame pillars erupted to Adam's right and left, turning the shards to dust.</p><br><p>Adam turned around and saw Lone Blaze, she stepped out of the fiery flash, joining him. She had no Moira with her, no Evolution Tree, no Silvana who lost contact with Adam, and no shared voice or shared sight could help her reach him.</p><br><p>Fearing nothing, Lone Blaze stepped forward, her flame dress rippling and her hair raised up full of energy.</p><br><p>"Come out and show yourself. If you do that right now, I will forgive you for threatening my master!"</p><br><p>Lone Blaze waved her hand, a menacing grimace covering her face.</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam turned around, out of the corner of his eye he noticed several shards behind him and two mirrors suspiciously pointed in their direction like cannons.</p><br><p>'Well, well... Now I think I'm beginning to understand what's going on here.'</p><br><p>No one showed themselves, but the attacks turned as well.</p><br><p>However, this did not suit Lone Blaze at all, who was clearly in an outrage.</p><br><p>"I said show yourself now little bitch!"</p><br><p>Her voice traveled through the mirrored space in a fiery wave, several shards melted, and the corners of the mirrors darkened.</p><br><p>"Stop! Enough!" an excited voice resounded from an unknown direction.</p><br><p>Then, the space in front of them trembled, the previously invisible mirror revealed itself emerging from the mirage.</p><br><p>Next, a silhouette stepped out - the owner of this small but powerful space.</p><br><p>A young man with white, disheveled hair and blue eyes crossed his arms over his chest, glaring unhappily at Adam and Lone Blaze. A black military-like outfit covered his lean body, the pieces of fabric at the edges shaking as if they might disappear at any moment.</p><br><p>He puffed up his cheeks, staring at Lone Blaze with disdain.</p><br><p>"Hah, it finally showed up, though I thought you'd have a feminine form..." Lone Blaze stammered. She had expected to see their opponent in a slightly different shape.</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Lone Blaze, then at the unknown young man.</p><br><p>His eyes went wide in understanding.</p><br><p>"Hah... I should have guessed sooner," he uttered in excitement. "So you're the Radiant Mirage, right? And you're the External Artifact?"</p><br><p>The young man rolled his eyes, reminiscent of the always disgruntled and sarcastic teen.</p><br><p>"Yes! Did it take you this long to realize that? Pffft!" he snorted. "You're even dumber than those brainless serpents!"</p><br><br><p>In a flash, Lone Blaze was in front of the young man, slapping him with a resounding, painful slap.</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage's pupils dilated, pain burning his cheek along with a wave of humiliation.</p><br><p>He turned to unleash his anger on Lone Blaze, but at the sight of her stern gaze, all his words stuck in his throat.</p><br><p>"You can say whatever you want about serpents. I don't care about them, but that Phantom is my master!" she pointed at Adam. He did nothing, watching from the sidelines.</p><br><p>He was fine with Lone Blaze doing all the work and doing it well, better than he did.</p><br><p>"I will not allow you to disrespect him. If you continue to behave in this manner, I swear I will destroy your world and absorb your energy!"</p><br><p>Radian Mirage stepped backward, stumbling over his own feet. He collapsed to the ground, staring fearfully at the fiery girl.</p><br><p>After a few moments, he gulped. "Whatever... I just thought you were enemies. I am in a dangerous situation! I have to be careful and even suspicious!"</p><br><p>Lone Blaze leaned over, looking at him like a worm.</p><br><p>'Damn,' Adam scratched the back of his head. 'So if I was a little weaker, Lone Blaze would treat me the same way? Hah, she's a scary woman. Or is it because this guy is also an External Artifact?'</p><br><p>Adam didn't show it so as not to disturb Lone Blaze in her 'negotiations', but he was pretty much surprised. This was the second time he had directly seen the External Artifact and was immediately in its space.</p><br><p>"Whatever," Lone Blaze spat out. "Better explain what's going on here, and what's your connection to these serpents? Are you their ally?"</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage quickly nodded a few times.</p><br><p>"Yes. It happened a few months ago! When their castle was attacked by the other monsters, the Light Legion, yes! My territory and their castle have always been in the same region, but at the same time, we were too far away for the serpents to know about me!"</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, his gaze thoughtful.</p><br><p>"But when everything happened, the rebels found you, and you're working with them now, right?"</p><br><p>Biting his lip, Radiant Mirage lowered his head. "I'm hiding their auras and giving them the resources I have in my territory. I figured it was better than being a mere power source for Arnoth and Kreyna."</p><br><p>Lone Blaze glanced at Adam. "What do you think?"</p><br><p>"It all sounds logical. I doubt Heret, Vorx, and the others would attack him, but sooner or later, Arnoth or Kreyna would. As resources got less, they'd have to widen their search area, and they'd find this place."</p><br><p>Then, Lone Blaze stepped back, holding her hands behind her back.</p><br><p>Adam leaned over. His and Radiant Mirage's gazes crossed.</p><br><p>"I already have an External Artifact occupying an important place in my power, I don't need a second one. So you'll either let the five of us into your territory and help me get stronger or..."</p><br><p>White waves of energy ran through Adam's body, his blue eyes shone brightly, and his body hid in the shadows.</p><br><p>"You will become my source of energy. I'm sure by absorbing you, I'll just destroy the next gates."</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage's face paled in horror.</p>
