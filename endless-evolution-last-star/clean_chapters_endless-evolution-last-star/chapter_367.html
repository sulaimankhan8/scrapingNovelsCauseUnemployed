            <br><p>Plague Reaper's coat could not only summon jaws but also transform another's energy, flesh, and blood into his own, eventually unleashing that power on his enemy.</p><br><p>Last time, Plague Reaper used this ability when Oskar almost managed to sever his head with his massive sword. Then, the jaw ripped Oskar's arm off, swallowed it, and turned it into energy.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper couldn't use this ability too often because it provoked a strong recoil, between each use he needed a long break so his body wouldn't collapse.</p><br><p>But... Unfortunately for Nessa, Plague Reaper was more than ready to unleash on her the full force of the veritable ocean of energy he now had in his hands.</p><br><p>His coat, the ghastly jaw absorbed the entire Scarlet Pyromancer, Top-8 monster, his genes, and Katrin's right arm.</p><br><p>Given how powerful the attack had been last time, Adam and Osana and their Operators realized that now Plague Reaper would demonstrate a completely different level of power and Nessa was the victim.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The red energy that came out of his hands turned into a massive jaw that crashed into Nessa, carrying her dozens of meters away like a raging bull using a battering ram.</p><br><p>Each time the jaw clamped down on its ghostly fangs, it split in two, becoming smaller but creating a new jaw.</p><br><p>Thus, in a few seconds, through a couple of bites, Nessa had to face more than ten small ghostly jaws.</p><br><p>Nessa tried to stop or defend herself somehow, but it was hardly possible in her situation.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The jaws were actively biting her in every place they could reach, sharp fangs digging deep into her flesh, some jaws ripping off chunks of skin, others tearing her long hair to shreds.</p><br><p>The jaws carried her forward, leaving behind a red trail of wisps of their energy and Nessa's dark blood spattering the ground during her agony.</p><br><br><p>Nessa cried out in pain like a beast when one of the jaws bit her ear, tearing half of it off. Before the next wave of pain could reach her mind, Nessa reached the ground.</p><br><p>She immediately tried to get up, but as soon as her feet hit the surface, a multitude of small jaws descended upon her in a hail of attacks.</p><br><p>They simply nailed her to the ground, tearing her sturdy body apart.</p><br><p>"AAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!"</p><br><p>Nessa could do nothing but scream in pain, clenching her fists tightly.</p><br><p>If it had been Adam, Katrin, or Osana in her place, they would most likely be dead by now, but Katrin's sturdy body was doing its best to keep its owner alive.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The last few bites came at her bones, jaws gnawing through her flesh, but... before they were about to lash out at Nessa once more, they shuddered and disappeared.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper growled, as his body arched backwards and a torrent of blood gushed from his mouth. A bright pain was reflected on his face, this attack absorbed a huge array of energy and possessed as formidable power as it gave off.</p><br><p>After this, Plague Reaper would not use this ability again, the risks were too great.</p><br><p>The jaws ran out of energy, so they shattered into particles, disappearing into the void. But... it was unlikely that Nessa would be able to continue fighting after this.</p><br><p>Discover hidden stories at empire</p><br><p>She looked like she had been attacked by a pack of wild wolves, practically tearing her body apart.</p><br><p>Only half of her left ear was left, her right ear was torn into tiny pieces, a third of her face was covered in bites and cuts from sharp fangs, and her right eye was missing.</p><br><p>Pieces of her own flesh, torn from her arms, legs, and torso, lay beside her, and in the path, the red ghostly jaws passed over.</p><br><p>Her limbs had wounds so deep that they showed gaps of bone, veins, and tendons sticking out.</p><br><p>If her muscles had not been so strong, the number of wounds would have been several times greater, the jaws would have left nothing of her.</p><br><p>Nessa's lips, part of which had been bitten off by her jaw, came into motion. Nessa whispered something, but it was impossible to hear it, her voice was too weak.</p><br><p>"FUCK! That's it, this has gone too far!" Magnus exclaimed furiously, about to storm out of the room like a storm and use all his connections to save Nessa.</p><br><p>She was still alive, but her condition was critical, almost pre-death.</p><br><br><p>However... Before he could get out, there was a click and a massive steel door closed in front of him, one that even a K0-Phantom could hardly destroy.</p><br><p>Immediately, Magnus turned around and glared angrily at Refesa, her finger tightly pressing the button.</p><br><p>"What the hell are you doing... Refesa, let me out, I'm not kidding... If need be I'll break your neck and walk out of here." Magnus said menacingly, in a cold voice.</p><br><p>However, this did not cause Refesa any emotion, her face remained calm. She knew Magnus was capable of this, but she just wasn't afraid of breaking her neck, it wasn't a problem for her.</p><br><p>"Well... I don't think that's necessary. I'm not talking about your threat, I'm talking about them needing help." Refesa said calmly, narrowing her eyes.</p><br><p>Magnus clenched his fists tightly, coming dangerously close to her.</p><br><p>"Rgh...? What the fuck are you talking about!!! If she gets even one more wound she will definitely die! The only Hybrid will disappear! Fuck! My daughter will die!" Magnus shouted with his face red in fury.</p><br><p>Refesa nodded, touching her small palm to his cheek.</p><br><p>"I understand, but unlike you, I've already seen something that makes me believe it." Refesa muttered looking at Magnus's rapidly widening eyes.</p><br><p>Then, she pointed to two screens where Katrin and Adam were visible.</p><br><p>Their gazes were directed at the injured Nessa, before fully focusing on Plague Reaper as their only enemy.</p><br><p>But, it wasn't just anger and a desire for revenge.</p><br><p>Their eyes were bloodshot and their veins swelled showing that they both entered Resonance.</p><br><p>"So... now we're in a rather curious situation moving towards its completion." Refesa stretched out with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>She looked at Katrin.</p><br><p>"She has a minute and a half of strong form left, then another 1:50 weakened, and her energy is pouring outward like limitless."</p><br><p>Then, Refesa's gaze fell on Adam.</p><br><p>"He's finally entered Resonance, but... how long can he last in that state? I bet his muscles will tear and his bones will break in less than two minutes.</p><br><p>Refesa pointed at Nessa with a heavy sigh.</p><br><p>"Unfortunately, she will not be able to fight anymore. She can only hope that her allies can defeat their enemy, speaking of which..."</p><br><p>Refesa stared at the Plague Reaper, dark trickles of blood flowed from the corners of his mouth, his breathing was heavy but slowly coming back to normal, and his scythe was already flying towards him, eager to become its owner's weapon again.</p><br><p>"He is not omnipotent either. It's time for him to defeat his last opponents or perish, as most monsters in Dead Lands are destined to."</p><br><p>For the last time, Refesa looked at Osana, who despite the situation tried to keep a cold-hearted expression on her face.</p><br><p>"And... She still hasn't used her trump card yet, but the moment is almost here."</p>
