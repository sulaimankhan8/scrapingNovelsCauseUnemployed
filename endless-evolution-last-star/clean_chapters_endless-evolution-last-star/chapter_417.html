            <br><p>"Hmm... I think she might like this." Adam scratched his head looking at the steel knife lying in the center of the stand under a glass lid.</p><br><p>'I remember mom always complaining about the dull knives and how they broke too easily... Well, if she hadn't been so rough when cooking she could avoid it, but when we lived in the slums we didn't have money for proper knives.' Adam pondered, scratching the back of his head.</p><br><p>The first person he decided to buy a gift for was Leona, his mother. She had a fiery temper and preferred to settle matters with force and a couple of harsh words.</p><br><p>In a way, it was not surprising that she chose to marry a quiet, somewhat shy man who just couldn't resist her pressure, but was good at maintaining balance in their family life.</p><br><p>"Can I help you with anything?"</p><br><p>Adam was approached by a medium-height girl with a slight smile on her face, she was an assistant at this store.</p><br><p>Adam wasn't as good at finding places and information as Silvana, so his choice fell on the most popular gift store in the Third Ring, located near the Second Ring, people from all the Rings often went here.</p><br><p>"Well, actually yes... I need gifts for my mom, dad, and little sister. I'm thinking of buying this knife for mom, what do you think?"</p><br><p>The girl tilted her head glancing at Adam's wrist. Every service worker in the Citadel did this, as it was important to understand if the client was an ordinary person or a Phantom.</p><br><p>On average, Phantoms had much more money and were always treated with more respect and attention. After all, the government didn't forget that it was necessary to maintain the Phantoms' status as heroes, those who lead the light for the future of all humanity.</p><br><p>Continue reading on empire</p><br><p>"Sure, the blade of this knife is made of strong steel, long blunt, and quick to sharpen, the handle is comfortable, coated with a special covering so your hands don't sweat." The girl explained in detail.</p><br><br><p>"Good, then I'll take it." Adam said glancing at the price. His eyes went wide for a moment as the knife cost several thousand credits, but now he could easily pay that amount for a knife, it was just the poor past trying to remind him of itself every chance it got.</p><br><p>"Excuse me, you're Adam Vinter, aren't you?" The girl asked, you could tell she was shy, but she couldn't pass up a chance like this.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Yes. Why?" Adam raised an eyebrow, looking at the girl puzzled.</p><br><p>"Can I have your autograph...?" The girl lowered her gaze while holding out a notepad and pen in front of her.</p><br><p>Adam was confused, no one had ever asked him for such a thing before. After all, although the Phantoms had popularity, it was usually the celebrities who handled autographs and interviews.</p><br><p>"Well, sure... but I want to know why you want my autograph?" Adam said picking up a pen, "Have we met somewhere before?"</p><br><p>The girl shook her head, then she pulled out her phone and showed Adam the video that was the reason for all of this.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, it was a popular edit of him, Katrin, and the others fighting in Dead Lands against the Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>In fact, it couldn't have been any other way. People were always interested in seeing something the rarest or greatest, the Top-1 monster of the Purple Threat Level was almost never shown in Dead Lands.</p><br><p>Thus, when the mission department posted all the files related to this mission, the popular channels and media quickly seized the opportunity.</p><br><p>Adam and Katrin were the main heroes of this battle, so most of the attention was focused on them. But, since Adam fought against Plague Reaper from start to finish, he had a lot more screen time, making people love and admire him.</p><br><br><p>"Fuck... they put that out too..." Adam muttered watching as he walked out of Fume Cathedral, Lero in his arms and Fume Armors walking behind him like his loyal servants, even though they were monsters.</p><br><p>After a while, Adam sighed heavily. Now that he thought about it, he realized that in some ways it was inevitable.</p><br><p>'Hah, I can't say that signing autographs is unpleasant... but, it's clearly not something I should be doing on a regular basis. I wonder how many people are trying to get Damien's one?' Adam pondered with a bitter smile on his face.</p><br><p>The girl's eyes filled with joy when Adam fulfilled her request, she eagerly took the notebook.</p><br><p>"You've chosen a gift for your mother, so... there are two more gifts left, aren't there?" The girl asked, moving on to her direct duties.</p><br><p>"Yes... I think the next one will be a father. Hmm..." Adam pondered, slowly rubbing his chin.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, he realized what would brighten his father's leisure time.</p><br><p>"What about puzzles and encyclopedias? Anything rare and not very popular, but still worthy among their audience?" Adam asked.</p><br><p>The girl nodded with a kind smile on her face.</p><br><p>"Sure, follow me, until I find the best gifts for your family, I won't rest."</p><br><br><p>"Oh, what a curious suggestion, it's like a gift isn't it?" Gladius uttered with a sly smile on his face.</p><br><p>Glara gulped as her eyes filled with fear.</p><br><p>"What...? Don't I want to kill a monster? Are you talking about it?" Glara muttered pointing at the Spark Seeker.</p><br><p>Aiden cast a glance at the Spark Seeker.</p><br><p>"No, I won't let you touch him. Furthermore, I don't think you'd want to get the Initial Gene from the Spark Seeker, they're pretty useless in that regard." Aiden explained, then he raised his palm to his chest.</p><br><p>On his wrist was a device similar to the NEP, but with his modifications. He turned on the device, a fully working hologram flashed over his wrist, with which he could control the entire Morton Observatory.</p><br><p>If he wanted to, Aiden could see what every worker in his technological kingdom was doing, but he hardly did, he didn't have time for it.</p><br><p>Aiden pressed a few buttons, and in less than a minute the same two girls that had brought Glara here earlier entered the room.</p><br><p>However, this time they were holding two black cases with unknown contents.</p><br><p>"Hah, long time no see." A girl with a lock of hair hanging in front of her face uttered, a smirk appearing on her face. She had blonde hair, strictly in a ponytail, except for that pesky lock that didn't want to obey her.</p><br><p>Gladius smirked, seeing the girls again.</p><br><p>"Sano, you seem pleased to see Glara." Gladius said, glancing at the girl with blonde hair.</p><br><p>Then, he shifted his gaze to the second girl. She had short red hair, pale skin, and a pretty face.</p><br><p>"Natta, you left only a short while ago, but now you had to come back again."</p><br><p>Natta nodded, then she took a few steps forward approaching Aiden.</p><br><p>She bowed low in respect before looking at the Spark Seeker.</p><br><p>"Hi, Shiny! I see you've been brought here this time, haven't you?"</p><br><p>Glara looked at Nitta in a baffled manner.</p><br><p>'What...? Shiny? What, she named that creepy monster like that?!'</p><br><p>Hearing Nitta's greeting, Shiny stuck out his tongue and licked his teeth contentedly, a smile seemed to appear on his face.</p><br><p>"That's enough. Open the cases." Aiden said sternly.</p><br><br><p>Sano and Nitta answered simultaneously.</p><br><p>Sano opened the case first, there was a mechanical syringe with an unknown filling... that could both kill Glara and give her new life.</p>
