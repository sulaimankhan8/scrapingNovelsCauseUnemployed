            <br><br><p>Adam and Heret rushed forward, killing several knights along the way. They weren't searching for victims on purpose, but the streets were too dense.</p><br><p>The resistance forces were numerous, and seeing the early successes of their brethren, other serpents were slowly joining the battle as well.</p><br><p>The Light Legion, knights, and soldiers tried to stop the rebellion. Many patrols fought against the serpents, both in the streets, in the houses, and the narrow alleys.</p><br><p>However, the main density was on the wide roads and squares.</p><br><p>And... there was someone more dangerous than simple soldiers and knights in the main square.</p><br><br><p>Simultaneously, Adam and Heret stopped at the roof. Their gazes went to the massive silhouette in the center of the square.</p><br><p>"Well, well... This big guy looks serious," Adam muttered, his eyes running over the calm warrior.</p><br><p>The Light Guardian, a massive giant-like monster, five meters tall, guarded one of the main paths leading directly into the castle.</p><br><p>His golden armor was dark, already covered in the blood of several serpents who decided to deal with a strong enemy, their corpses lying at the borders of the square.</p><br><p>Besides his great body, the Light Guardian had another weapon, a massive two-handed hammer, his hands lay on the hilt, resting on his weapon until the next enemy arrived.</p><br><p>Did the Light Guardian notice that Adam and Heret came?</p><br><br><p>However, he will not attack them, not now. As soon as they cross the square line, the Light Guardian will engage. He was willing to go to any lengths to stop the two rebels.</p><br><p>"S4-monster? Huh." Adam crossed his arms over his chest, his eyes growing deeper. "He looks formidable, but... Isn't that the same power level as Vorx?"</p><br><p>Heret nodded weakly. "Something like that. It may not be the strongest opponent for you, but among all the serpents, only I and Vorx are capable of fighting against the Light Guardians. Maybe Torz and Grita can handle one if they work together."</p><br><p>"The Light Guardians? There's more than one?"</p><br><p>"Yes, five in all. Two are in the main castle gates. One more at each spire, and one right in front of us."</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head, puzzled. "Doesn't that mean we have to help the others? I mean, out of the entire resistance, only six people can compete with them."</p><br><p>"Nah, that won't be necessary. Before we move towards the bridge leading to the throne room, we will destroy the castle's main gates. Once the rest of the Light Guardians sense this, they will go to help."</p><br><p>A smirk played across Adam's face. "I see... Waste no time and act efficiently?"</p><br><br><p>Then, Heret's voice grew quieter.</p><br><p>"So, which one of us will deal with him? As you can see, he's willing to wait until we move into action."</p><br><p>Adam poked himself in the chest. "Let me do this. If we're going to fight against Arnoth and I'm going to go number one, I need a warm-up!"</p><br><p>"Hah, I didn't expect any other answer."</p><br><br><p>Adam jumped from the roof, in two leaps, finding himself in front of the square's border.</p><br><p>The Light Guardian stepped forward, his bulky armor rattling, but he did not spring into action. As soon as Adam passed onward, then their fight would begin.</p><br><p>"S4 monster, right?" he muttered, looking at his left hand.</p><br><p>'You want to kill him in one move?' Silvana's voice boomed in his mind. 'You could do it with a second needle.'</p><br><p>'Well, then it won't be a warm-up. I have fought against Vorx and Heret many times, they are S4 monsters. Risha is not a monster, but she is at the same level. So... It will be useful to understand how strong an S4 monster of the Light Legion is.'</p><br><p>Adam knew that Arnoth and Kreyna were both S5 monsters. Moreover, Arnoth was much stronger than Kreyna, even though they were technically at the same stage.</p><br><br><p>Like a ghost, Adam dashed forward, facing the great guardian in a few fleeting steps.</p><br><p>The Light Guardian wasted no time. He raised his hammer, filling the head with the blinding power of light.</p><br><p>Despite his size, the Light Guardian moved very fast, almost instantly bringing his hammer down directly on Adam.</p><br><p>Heret's eyes narrowed. He remained at his spot, watching the events unfold, but the guardian's power made him nervous, if only for a moment.</p><br><br><p>Then a hand covered in white energy rose upward, touching the corner of the hammer.</p><br><p>A cloud of dust rushed upward, hiding Adam's silhouette.</p><br><p>With the next rush of wind, Heret could see what happened.</p><br><p>Adam's feet were sunk into the ground up to his ankles, the surface could not withstand such a powerful blow, but Adam could.</p><br><p>The Light Guardian's arms were shaking, trying to break Adam, wanting to apply a little more force, but Adam's arm remained steady and firm as a steel rod.</p><br><p>Adam did not use his Initial Order or his Power Gene. Only his physical strength and energy control allowed him to stop the Light Guardian's strike.</p><br><p>"Ghha!" the Light Guardian wheezed, trying to say something. "H-How...?!"</p><br><p>A look of surprise spread across Adam's face. He hadn't expected the Light Guardian to be able to talk.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Looks like saying a few words is too difficult for him, but he has this ability. So... After all, strength is one of the important indicators for a monster to be able to talk, right?'</p><br><p>He and Heret had killed many light soldiers and light knights, but all they heard from them was wheezing and painful groans. None of it sounded like real, human speech.</p><br><br><p>Heret's voice boomed behind them.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you're right. I wasted too much time on him."</p><br><p>Before the Light Guardian could respond, Adam leaped forward, running at the Light Guardian's huge hands.</p><br><p>Adam's palm, a blade full of energy, pierced the guardian's armor, releasing a torrent of dark blood.</p><br><p>The Light Guardian tried to grab Adam and toss him aside, but it was too late.</p><br><p>Adam's frame shuddered as he appeared behind the great guardian.</p><br><p>Then, a white line flashed across the monster's neck, severing the guardian's head from his body.</p>
