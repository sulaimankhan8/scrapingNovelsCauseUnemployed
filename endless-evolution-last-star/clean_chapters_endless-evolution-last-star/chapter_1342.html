            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1342: Guard of the White Gates</strong></p><br><p>Unexpectedly for Adam, it was the unusual object he noticed at the very beginning of his journey to the Forgotten Mills that would become his final destination in this territory.</p><br><br><p>He walked slowly forward, looking around. Five tall peaks rose from the ground like the hand of a giant reaching for the heavens, but they were unable to rise above the beacon and even touch the bright light at its summit.</p><br><p>From the outside, the Silver Beacon resembled Gareyna’s mill and the other mills of the White Thread. However, it was majestic and enormous, like a tower that had seen hundreds or even thousands of years under its watchful gaze.</p><br><p>The lands around it were empty, but not lonely. The Silver Beacon did not need neighbors or allies to be complete.</p><br><p>White grass, its tips trembled with each of Adam’s careful steps as he gradually approached the beacon.</p><br><p>Misty, who had stopped in front of the barrier, nodded deeply and hurried back. The fact that Adam was able to pass through the barrier easily and didn’t even realize it at first meant that the Silver Beacon knew about him, knew that sooner or later he would come and try to earn its approval.</p><br><p>Well, that wasn’t Adam’s goal. He had come to the Silver Beacon to achieve the Desire of Beyond, and he needed to figure out how to do that.</p><br><p>Silvana said nothing, but together with Adam, she kept a close watch on her surroundings. In fact, they had no reason to be so wary. The atmosphere was calm and even relaxed, but the very status of the Silver Beacon weighed heavily on their shoulders.</p><br><p>“Do you see that?” Adam asked as he approached the Silver Beacon.</p><br><p>In response, she nodded deeply. “Yes, it looks like we’ll have to get past the guard first.”</p><br><p>Standing before the gates of the Silver Beacon was a tall knight, fully armored in snow-white armor with sharp, wide edges. However, he was no ordinary knight. He was a veritable giant, ten meters tall, armed with a great double-bladed axe.</p><br><p>The knight was looking straight at Adam, or rather in that direction, for Adam could see neither eyes nor light in the slit in the knight’s helmet.</p><br><p>‘How strange, is he even alive?’ Adam wondered as he continued to move forward.</p><br><p>However, when he crossed a certain line, a powerful aura emanated from the knight, but not to unleash his wrath on Adam or attack him.</p><br><p>The bright white flame that burst from the knight’s frame was necessary for him to wake up after a long sleep.</p><br><p>Slowly, his eyelids lifted, revealing two deep-set eyes hidden behind his helmet. His eyes were white and clear as crystals, slowly meeting Adam’s blue ones.</p><br><p>“Young Phantom, or… young human… My mistress has been waiting for you for a long time,” the knight replied before stepping forward, breaking out of the stance he had held for many months or even years.</p><br><p>“M-Mistress…?” Adam muttered, unsure of who the knight was referring to.</p><br><p>In response, the knight nodded deeply and touched his chest with his palm before raising his hand high toward the light.</p><br><p>“I am the Knight of the White Spire, and my mistress is the Ancient Artifact whose territory you have chosen to enter, the Silver Beacon. Although… if she so desires, you will learn more about her, her name.”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened as the figure of Lone Blaze immediately came to mind. She had been his loyal ally for a long time, but she never had a name like humans or the Lords did.</p><br><p>He thought that the same rules applied to the Ancient Artifacts, because even Norax referred to the knight’s mistress as the Silver Beacon, not by her name.</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam gulped and decided to try to learn more about how this place worked.</p><br><p>“Norax sent me here. He said that the Silver Beacon would accept me, only me, for some reason.”</p><br><p>In response, the knight nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“That’s right. I don’t have the right to tell you too much, young man, but I can pique your interest and dispel your doubts.”</p><br><p>He pointed toward the summit again.</p><br><p>“When you reach the light, you will surely receive what you came for. However, in return, you must give or show something that will impress my mistress. For each contender, it is always something different.”</p><br><br><p>‘Nothing but riddles and no details. However, if he obeys the Silver Beacon, it’s not surprising. He’s just a guard, but… the Knight of the White Spire? What is that? White Spire… neither Norax nor Misty nor anyone else has ever mentioned it, there hasn’t even been a hint.’</p><br><p>“Young man,” the knight said sternly. “You will have time to ponder later. Right now, you must prove that my lady will not waste her precious time on you.”</p><br><p>Adam knew where this was going, but he couldn’t help smiling cheekily.</p><br><p>“Well, am I not the only interesting event that has broken the long-standing routine of your powerful mistress? I’m sure that sitting alone at the top for decades, even without a show, is not very interesting.”</p><br><p>The knight’s eyes darkened.</p><br><p>“An interesting theory… However, you equate the Ancient Artifact to the Lords, they are different creatures. The difference between them is the same as between you and monsters, as between you and me.”</p><br><p>That should have stopped Adam, but his opinion ran counter to the knight’s beliefs.</p><br><p>He shrugged, glancing toward the Forgotten Mills.</p><br><p>“You know, monsters and humans are sometimes very similar to each other, and some monsters fear other humans, just as ordinary people fear monsters. It all depends on the situation and the person.”</p><br><br><p>The knight said nothing. He had no answer to that, for he could not refute Adam’s words.</p><br><p>“I see…” the knight sighed after a long pause. “You really are not like most humans. I can see that you have been through many battles to come to this conclusion. Still… I cannot let you in without a test.”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes flashed as his aura burst forth in its full power.</p><br><p>“Sure, show me what you can do. I’m sure you need to look good in front of your mistress.”</p>
