            <br><p>One minute - just long enough for the platform to rise from the ground towering above the First Ring, given the preparation time it took Nefis to launch.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana looked around with wide-open eyes. They couldn't believe what was happening and were completely baffled.</p><br><p>The first thing they thought was that someone must notice them. After all, the platform was flying upwards in the very center of the Citadel, but none of the people were paying attention to them.</p><br><p>Some seemed to be looking directly at them from the high floors of the skyscrapers in the distance. However, Silvana and Adam quickly realized that these people saw nothing.</p><br><p>Then, from outside came Douglas's satisfied voice:</p><br><p>"Don't worry. None of the common people or the K2-Phantoms will be able to see us, the barrier just won't let it happen."</p><br><p>Adam glanced at the unusual barrier, he had only one guess as to how it worked.</p><br><p>"It's... The barrier is powered by artifacts?"</p><br><p>Douglas nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yes, mighty and rare ones. They are specially selected to provide levitation, protection, cloak, and more. They complement each other creating this unique tunnel leading us straight to the very top."</p><br><p>At Douglas's words, Adam raised his head, observing the massive outline of something great and massive.</p><br><p>"It's... I don't even know what to say..." Adam stammered with difficulty controlling his emotions, "There was an island above the Citadel all this time? I mean... Why didn't I see it before?"</p><br><p>Seyrina's corners of her lips went up, showing just how naive Adam was.</p><br><p>"Because there's a barrier around the island, though... the source of that barrier isn't artifacts. It's..."</p><br><p>Before she could say anything else, Douglas's cold gaze, sharp as a blade, darted to her.</p><br><p>Seyrina gulped, falling silent.</p><br><p>"Khm." Douglas coughed, pointing upwards, the platform continued its motion, "I think you've already figured out that the island above us is the Zero Ring. It's a special area and there are many reasons for that. I think you'll discover some of them, little by little."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion. Even though he was allowed to visit the Zero Ring, he still didn't have access to all the mysteries.</p><br><p>It kept the flames inside him burning, but it irritated him just as much.</p><br><p>'Hm.... I don't remember ever seeing Douglas so seriously. Not that I've had hundreds of encounters with him, but I should be careful. There's no telling what's waiting for me at the top.'</p><br><br><p>"Also, the Zero Ring goes by a name such as Heaven Island; that's what you'll hear most often, the Zero Ring is the official version."</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly. It was good to know, but not something that bothered him right now.</p><br><p>"What about the military down there?" Adam asked, his voice low, "I thought ordinary people weren't supposed to know about Heaven Island. I realize there may be exceptions, but judging by the '4' on that man's chest, that's just one squad out of several."</p><br><p>"Hah, calling them military would be wrong. However, I can see why you said that they do look alike and perform the same tasks, just in different locations."</p><br><p>Douglas smiled widely before stating:</p><br><p>"The people you saw down in front of the gate are the Gamma Division. They do the technical work, oversee security, and keep the operation of Heaven Island. Each of them is a selected military from the regular squads."</p><br><p>Douglas wasn't going to stop:</p><br><p>"They have gone through a rigorous, multi-level training, not knowing until the very end what they are preparing for. Naturally, every measure was taken to make sure that no one from the Gamma Division would tell about Heaven Island. I won't reveal the methods, but I assure you they are working."</p><br><p>A bitter smile reflected on Adam's face.</p><br><p>"Hah, so those methods aren't humane at all."</p><br><p>"Do you have a problem with that?" Douglas raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"I don't think so. That man, he looked tough. Is he strong?"</p><br><p>"Sure, every member of the Gamma Division is an excellent fighter. They are some of the strongest men in the entire Citadel, the best among millions."</p><br><p>Adam thought for a moment. He didn't meet many ordinary people associated with the Dead Lands on his path.</p><br><p>'Some of the strongest... But, what about him?'</p><br><p>Then, Adam stared at Douglas, the desire to know the answer to his question evident in his eyes.</p><br><p>"What about Max? The squad commander of the Gamma Division and Max. Which one of them would win in a 1 vs. 1."</p><br><p>It seemed that Douglas was not the right person for Adam to ask that question to. However, Douglas's smirk made it clear that he knew who Adam was talking about.</p><br><p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p><br><p>Scratching the back of his head, Douglas replied:</p><br><p>"Well, that's not fair. First of all, Max isn't human for some time now. I think you know nothing is stopping him from becoming a Phantom anymore, so he did it."</p><br><p>Adam only nodded deeply. He wasn't surprised that Max turned into the Phantom. He lost to him in fights many times, so he was well aware of what Max was capable of. It was only a matter of time, it had to happen and it did.</p><br><p>"Agh, Max is a rare case. I'm afraid not even a fighter of the Gamma Division can match him. Well, back in the days when he was still human."</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam nodded understandingly, "So the platform, the gamma division, and the impervious barrier."</p><br><p>Then, he directed his gaze upward:</p><br><p>"All this is to hide the Heaven Island."</p><br><p>"Yes." Douglas sighed, "In fact, not a few people know about the Heaven Island. They include all K3-Phantoms and above, their Operators, the gamma division, and high-ranking members of the government."</p><br><p>For a brief period, Adam glanced at Douglas as if wanting to ask:</p><br><p>'Which category do you fall into?'</p><br><p>He kept his thoughts to himself, waiting for the platform to take them to Heaven Island.</p><br><p>A shadow fell over the four silhouettes as the platform disappeared into a vertical tunnel, slowing as it approached the surface.</p>
