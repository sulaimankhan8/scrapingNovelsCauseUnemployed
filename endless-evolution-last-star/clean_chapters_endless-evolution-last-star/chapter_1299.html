            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1299: Ureyn’s Fall (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Millions of tiny needles trembled in the wind, ringing like bells throughout the dome covering Adam and Ureyn.</p><br><p>The gray hail was one of the most difficult techniques that a member of the Gray Needle could learn, but Ureyn had long since mastered it and achieved perfection in it.</p><br><p>Each needle was under his complete control, and his dome was perfect.</p><br><p>Adam looked around, seeing not a single gap among the countless needles. They were all identical to each other, with sharp tips ready to pierce his flesh at Ureyn’s command.</p><br><p>“Not bad, not bad at all.”</p><br><p>Ureyn frowned, piercing Adam with his gaze.</p><br><p>“Not bad? Is that all you have to say? Neither you nor any other Phantom will ever attain such power! It takes decades of experience, knowledge, and wisdom from those who have gone through countless battles.”</p><br><p>However, no matter how hard Ureyn tried to show Adam the superiority of the Gray Needle techniques, it did not impress Adam at all.</p><br><p>“Well, obviously, a lot of work has gone into this technique. But it’s still not your power. I don’t see any wind at all, aren’t you Ureyn, the Grim Wind?”</p><br><p>“That doesn’t matter anymore! I used to be weak, but after devoting time to myself and my abilities, I realized that wind is not my main strength. That was my mistake, because the techniques and the needle are my nature as a monster and as a resident of these lands!” Ureyn exclaimed, pressing his palm firmly to his chest in pride.</p><br><p>In response, Adam just scratched the back of his head with an awkward expression on his face.</p><br><p>“Maybe that’s enough? If you think that’s your strength… then I think you’re deeply mistaken.”</p><br><p>Ureyn’s gaze became more serious.</p><br><p>“In that case, Adam, answer me this: what is your power? Where does it come from? I’m sure you’re not as different from me as you want to appear.”</p><br><p>His voice betrayed his confidence that this question would stump Adam, for it was obvious that he had received his power from the Initial Gene.</p><br><br><p>Adam pointed his thumb at his chest and declared with a broad smile:</p><br><p>“In me. Only I control my power; everything else, be it my artifact, the Evolution Tree, or even the Operator, is a pillars that support me, but I am the foundation of everything, and it will always be so!”</p><br><br><p>Adam’s statement brought silence to the wind plain.</p><br><br><p>A dark chuckle came from the side as a sharp gleam flashed across Norax’s eyes.</p><br><p>“How arrogant, but that only makes it better, doesn’t it?”</p><br><p>Ureyn clenched his fists as his veins bulged. The members of the Gray Needle and even many in the White Thread had a similar reaction. They all respected their abilities, techniques, and those who created them.</p><br><p>Only the Black Cut members clearly supported Adam’s words, for they were just as arrogant bastards as he was, believing only in their own strength.</p><br><p>Sure, everyone was entitled to their opinion.</p><br><p>But someone was always right and someone was always wrong.</p><br><p>Who made the mistake this time? The arrogant Adam or Ureyn, who decided to get rid of his former arrogance and accept the power of his faction?</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Ureyn’s aura trembled as he aimed the needles directly at Adam.</p><br><p>“I admit, your previous ability was strong, it almost killed me. But, that won’t help you avoid my next attack!”</p><br><p>At the same moment, more than a hundred needles came into motion, heading towards Adam. The sharp tips cut through the wind with a whistle, heading towards Adam’s weak spots.</p><br><p>In some ways, Ureyn was right. Adam’s path couldn’t help him defend himself from these needles. Moreover, this was only a small part of what Ureyn was capable of.</p><br><p>However, Adam already had a plan of action. As soon as he saw the dome of needles, he immediately understood that it had to be gotten rid of as quickly as possible.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, using his energy to create a white burst with his stomp. This was enough to throw the needles aside, and they scattered on the ground.</p><br><p>Ureyn nodded slightly; he was ready for this, and with his next wave of his hand, several hundred needles trembled.</p><br><p>‘What’s going on?’ Ureyn thought, looking at Adam. ‘Why does he continue to behave so carelessly? Why is he so confident in his abilities when he has only been on the path of power for a year?! For most monsters of his level, that’s nothing more than a moment!’</p><br><p>Ureyn’s grand mistake was that he considered Adam’s words to be an attempt to show off, which was not entirely true, as Adam had honestly answered Ureyn’s question.</p><br><p>Adam believed in himself, his powers, and his abilities, and they went beyond the simple path of two needles and threads.</p><br><p>Before the tiny needles could reach Adam, he raised his right hand as a crimson stream ran along it, forming five rings connected by chains.</p><br><p>“Wait, what is that?” Ureyn muttered in disbelief. In the heat of battle, he had completely forgotten that one of the components of the Phantom’s power was their Nexus.</p><br><p>Adam had not yet revealed the full power of his new Nexus; he had never used the fifth ring. Unfortunately or not for Ureyn, Adam saw no need for it.</p><br><p>Now, he could get rid of Ureyn’s complex technique and a million floating needles with just one attack.</p><br><p>All he needed for that was pure firepower.</p><br><p>The first ring glowed brightly, emitting a scarlet light as dense energy gathered at his fist, shaking the space.</p><br><p>With each heartbeat, the flash of energy grew brighter as Adam spared no effort, wanting to end this stage with a single action.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s calm voice rang out as crimson light fell on half of his face.</p><br><p>“You may have the most unique abilities and complex techniques in your arsenal. But, having reached your level, have you still not understood that in the end, absolute power is what decides everything?”</p><br><p>Without waiting for an answer, Adam slammed his fist into the ground, summoning crimson blades that shot out from the blast, slashing through everything in their path, whether needles or ancient earth.</p>
