            <br><p>Strangely enough, the stronger Phantom became, the less often he needed the genes of simple monsters.</p><br><p>In the beginning, Adam needed to collect as many genes as possible to become stronger, most notably when he needed genes to fill the chains around his Lock.</p><br><p>Only after he had collected a thousand neutral genes he could find out where his Initial Monster was. This was a direct path to becoming a K1-Phantom and could actually be done quite quickly.</p><br><p>But, the path to K2 wasn't as fast since there were many different conditions. Collecting artifacts was more difficult than a few hundred genes, and Midnight Crystal was a task beyond all others.</p><br><p>Thus, Adam had already collected the required number of genes for the Key long ago. In fact, he didn't even collect the genes of the monsters he killed anymore, because there was no point in doing so.</p><br><p>When he went to the next level, he would only need to kill a few monsters to refill the missing genes.</p><br><p>But... now that he had killed the Light Yellow Threat monster, it was time to see something new.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A single gene came out of Gray Stalker's body in the form of a rune covered in pale yellow energy. Outwardly, the gene looked weak and unstable like Gray Stalker himself in the majestic hierarchy of the Yellow Threat Level monsters.</p><br><p>However, not taking into account special genes such as the Initial Gene and Power Gene, it was the highest-level gene that Adam received.</p><br><p>[Gray Stalker, Light Yellow Gene x1 - has been placed in your Vault!]</p><br><p>The yellow rune flew into Revolve, a snow-white vortex in front of Adam's palm, and headed towards the massive book inside his space. Specifically, this gene wasn't something Adam needed for any purpose, but it was a kind of milestone in his path.</p><br><p>One way or another, most K1-Phantoms, weren't capable of defeating Light Yellow monsters.</p><br><p>"What a strangely satisfying feeling, like I've finally taken another step forward, though... I still need Midnight Crystal for that." Adam muttered, clenching his fist tightly.</p><br><p>Then, he stared at Scarlet Pyromancer standing off to the side.</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer wasn't as smart as Thunder Demon or North Keeper, but he didn't need to be clever or cunning to realize Adam's intentions.</p><br><p>Adam's glance was enough for Scarlet Pyromancer to feel threatened, for him to realize that he was facing a hunter who thought of him as prey.</p><br><p>Perhaps another monster would have chosen to run away, but Scarlet Pyromancer had a certain pride due to his status.</p><br><p>Sure, Scarlet Pyromancer didn't know that the mission department rated him as a Top-8 among Purple Threat Level monsters, but he realized that he was stronger than most other monsters.</p><br><p>Moreover, he wasn't afraid to fight Gray Stalker and even killed them even though they were higher-level creatures.</p><br><p>Thus, Scarlet Pyromancer was not going to be frightened of Adam, the Phantom who was on the same level as him. He possessed the power to fight for his life, and he was going to do so either to triumph or to the last drop of his blood!</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Scarlet Pyromancer began to move its massive heavy wings vigorously, and the petals on its six legs shone brightly.</p><br><p>Then, a transparent flame appeared around the monster, which gradually grew larger and larger, turning into some sort of silhouette.</p><br><p>Erla's eyes went wide for they all knew that this was the manifestation of an aura! She couldn't believe that Scarlet Pyromancer had such a deep knowledge of the use of aura.</p><br><p>Soon, the silhouette of a huge beetle that looked like a large and terrifying version of Scarlet Pyromancer himself appeared above Scarlet Pyromancer. This was his Second Stage Spirit and the appearance of his The Will.</p><br><p>The aura quickly spread around, immediately demonstrating Scarlet Pyromancer's intentions and the power level of the others...</p><br><br><p>Lero and Erla gasped. They tried to resist the monster's aura, but they could hardly do so. Most K1-Phantoms didn't know how to use The Will and had no Aura Seal, just a simple aura emanating from their pure power, nothing more.</p><br><p>So, Lero and Erla fell to the ground, breathing heavily with their eyes wide open. They rested their hands on the ground trying not to collapse completely.</p><br><p>Katrin and Oskar shuddered vigorously, having to take a few steps backward clenching their fists tightly. After a few seconds, Oskar grabbed his chest and dropped to one knee.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the only one besides Adam who remained steady on her feet was Osana.</p><br><p>No new emotions appeared on her face, she still kept a calm smile and kept her eyes practically closed. Only the wind ruffled her long pink hair.</p><br><p>Katrin glanced at Osana in disbelief.</p><br><p>'What the hell...? How can that bitch stay so calm? This monster's aura made it hard to breathe!' Katrin internally exclaimed.</p><br><p>Well, soon she and everyone else felt the much-desired relief as Adam decided to release his Spirit as well.</p><br><p>An aura in the form of white flames covered everything around, the center of which was a substantially faceless being made of thousands of silver threads tightly woven together.</p><br><p>Then, two spheres of red and white aura collided with each other trying to suppress their enemy.</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer pressed his legs closer together as well as all parts of his body. It was obvious that he was struggling to withstand this confrontation, but he was strong enough to prevent Adam from winning.</p><br><p>To wound another creature with an aura there had to be a serious difference in strength between the two opponents. If the difference in power wasn't crushing, then the weaker opponent could withstand the other's aura attack.</p><br><p>"Oh, not bad, not bad at all. Essence Monsters are worthy opponents after all." Adam smirked while their auras dissipated.</p><br><p>Neither aura was able to completely suppress the other, so after the collision they slowly disappeared like particles of white and red flame.</p><br><p>Adam smirked and stepped forward, extending his right arm. He was ready to use his needle and start fighting.</p><br><p>Scarlet Pyromancer responded in kind. His long horn flashed with scarlet flames and his glands began to swell in preparation to unleash a powerful stream of fire on Adam.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the ground shook and the streams of black smoke coming out of the cracks covering the surface became much thicker.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>In some places, as if on someone's command, several massive monsters with horrible, unpleasant, and disgusting-looking bodies emerged from the ground.</p><br><p>There were only five of them, and although they appeared at the same time, they were not controlled by anyone.</p><br><p>Adam and Scarlet Pyromancer were to blame for this. Minor bursts of energy during the battle against the Gray Stalkers could not disturb the monsters that lurked in this area near the Fume Cathedral, but Adam's and Scarlet Pyromancer's auras had attracted the inhabitants of this land.</p><br><p>Adam frowned turning to the nearest monster. Find adventures on мѵʟ</p><br><p>"Holy shit, you're nasty." Adam frowned heavily as he stared at the huge monster towering over him with a creepy face like a disfigured human mask, with a perpetual frozen smirk.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The ground shook once more, revealing several silhouettes that were hidden behind a dense shroud of black fog, but clearly coming in their direction.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes. He had no intention of attracting the attention of all the monsters around Fume Cathedral, but there was nothing more he could do.</p>
