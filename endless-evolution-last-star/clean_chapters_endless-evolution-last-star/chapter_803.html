            <br><p>For a while, Adam and the Crimson Monarch looked to one side. Black particles slowly emanated from Katrin, filling their gazes with disbelief.</p><br><p>Adam didn't know how he managed to cause large amounts of black particles during the battle against the Blind Commander, now it was happening to Katrin.</p><br><p>It wasn't a mistake, he realized it from the very depths of his being. Katrin was about to get the Desire Star, bearing the same consequences as Adam.</p><br><p>Unlike him, she was going to have it in the standard period, since she already unlocked the Star Seal some time ago, yet the fight was the best time to get stronger.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch nodded slightly as he twitched. In a moment, he found himself in front of Katrin, intending to finish her off before any unknown changes occurred.</p><br><br><p>Adam appeared in front of the Crimson Monarch, blocking his attack.</p><br><p>"Hey, didn't you say I was your main target?"</p><br><p>Adam's corners of his lips went up, feeling how quickly Katrin's aura was growing.</p><br><p>"In that case, why waste time on someone who's already lost?"</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch narrowed his eyes, irritation building up inside him.</p><br><p>"Adam... Do you think you're the smart one? I hasten to disappoint you, you are not. You understand perfectly well why I'm in a hurry to kill her. And... You can't protect her."</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Crimson Monarch's wing came into motion, but its target was not Adam, but the monarch's back.</p><br><p>Three claws cut into his flesh, deep enough to release bright drops of blood. At the sweep of his arm, hundreds of drops flew apart, seeking out any monsters ready to receive his power.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils dilated, he felt something strange.</p><br><p>'Wait... If only for a fraction of a second, but his aura became much weaker. I see, so he has limits, but... the chances of his powers running out before mine, they simply aren't there.'</p><br><p>Perhaps if Adam were less experienced, he might try to exhaust the Crimson Monarch, but he realized that the difference between their energy reserves was too great.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Within seconds, dozens of shadows appeared in the distance, powerful auras and wild gazes were their hallmarks.</p><br><p>The ground shook at their powerful stomping, they had only one goal, to tear Katrin apart to accomplish the will of their ruler.</p><br><p>Adam looked around cautiously, assessing the number of opponents. Then, he cautiously cast a glance in the Crimson Monarch's direction.</p><br><p>"Just drops of blood? Looks like even you can't throw hundreds of clots around, can you?"</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch was wary. It was a disadvantage to him that Adam was trying to understand the boundaries of his power.</p><br><p>"They're just not worthy of it. The Frost Maiden had potential, so she got more than my energy or a drop of blood. However, she made a mistake and died because of one attack from you."</p><br><p>"Do you consider her beyond trash?"</p><br><p>The sudden question caught the Crimson Monarch off guard. Anger appeared in his gaze, he realized that Adam was trying to buy Katrin time, but... something in Adam's gaze made him change his mind.</p><br><p>Adam asked sincerely.</p><br><p>"Tsk. Of course not. It's not the dog's fault for not being able to defeat a wild wolf in an even fight, it's his master's failure."</p><br><p>In response, Adam nodded deeply, mulling over his words.</p><br><p>"So even monarchs make mistakes, right?"</p><br><p>"Sure, those who don't know how to admit their mistakes are fools. There's nothing wrong with mistakes, all you have to do is make sure your opponent is making more mistakes!"</p><br><p>Without further ado, the Crimson Monarch rushed forward, attacking Adam with several quick thrusts.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide as his energy traveled to his hands, blocking each of the Crimson Monarch's lunges.</p><br><p>Their pace was even, if necessary Adam could hold out in endless clashes for quite some time, but... the monsters were already close. It wouldn't take more than a few seconds for their jaws and claws to attempt to attack Katrin.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch remained calm. It was obvious to him that Adam would not be able to protect Katrin.</p><br><p>But... Adam already had a plan. The corners of his lips went up, forming a sly smirk, making a baffled look on the Crimson Monarch's expression.</p><br><p>'Agh...? What is he up to? From the looks of it, he's not the kind of warrior that has mass attacks. Could I be wrong? No... If he had such abilities, he would have used them earlier.'</p><br><p>With a fiery gaze, as if reading the Crimson Monarch's thoughts, Adam raised his head with a look of victory.</p><br><p>"Hah, haven't you noticed that, unlike you, I've completely abandoned the wing?"</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's gaze became lost.</p><br><br><p>Then, his bloodshot eyes reflected a multitude of silver flashes coming out of Adam's hands. One thread after another emanated from the rings on his fingers.</p><br><p>This time Lone Blaze's flames did not enhance his threads, keeping them in their original state, yet Adam didn't need it.</p><br><p>There were too many threads for precise control and no fire, but he would do his job.</p><br><br><p>Adam jumped back sharply, stopping a step away from Katrin, the dark particles already covering part of her legs, and the swords were ready to shatter at any moment, forever.</p><br><p>"Hah, even though I said I won't protect her, but... I have no choice once again. I'm just too curious about how her Nexus will change."</p><br><p>Then, dozens of shadows fell upon Adam, only fierce eyes and sharp fangs were visible among the massive figures with eerie auras.</p><br><p>Without a hint of fear, Adam crossed his arms over his chest, his palms touching his shoulders.</p><br><p>His eyes grew deeper, blue stars shining amidst the dark abyss, showing that it was not he who was wrong, but the Crimson Monarch and all his servants.</p><br><p>A shudder ran along a dozen threads as Adam's hands came into motion - in flashes spreading out in different directions at breakneck speed.</p><br><p>The clear threads were instantly coated in blood, passing through the flesh and thick hide of the monsters like sharp blades.</p><br><p>Some monsters were tougher than others, the threads stuck on their bones, but Adam was ready for it.</p><br><br><p>With a deep breath, cold steam passing before his eyes, Adam twisted his wrists, steering the threads in a chaotic pattern.</p><br><p>Gaining new momentum, the threads curved at a strange angle, tying themselves around the surviving monsters and tearing them to shreds. If they were caught in a meat grinder, there would be a lot more whole chunks left of them.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>The paws and heads of the monsters with their mangled bodies fell to the ground one by one, buying Katrin the little time she needed.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes traveled backward for a moment.</p><br><p>'Hmmm... It only took me a few seconds to get through the process, otherwise the Blind Commander would have killed me. It should have come to an end by now.'</p><br><p>Dense black energy completely covered Katrin while her aura rapidly grew.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch understood this as well, but his bet on the enhanced monsters didn't pay off.</p><br><p>Deep inside, he regretted it, for he misunderstood the nature of Adam's ability:</p><br><p>'So... his threads are weapons? Last time, he created a wing for himself... my assumption that it was a tool for shapes turned out to be wrong! But... why didn't he use such a powerful ability before?'</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>A distinct crack interrupted his thoughts. Black shards flew off to the sides, slowly revealing Katrin's silhouette.</p><br><p>Her wounds didn't disappear anywhere, nor did her appearance remain the same - Desire Star had a different target.</p><br><p>With streams of dark energy surging from her body in a wild rush, Katrin's figure slowly rose from the ground. Her aura grew much stronger since the gap between her and Adam shrank after receiving the Desire Star. Now, she had two cells out of four in her Star Seal.</p><br><p>Adam's gaze dropped lower, to her hands, as his eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>As he expected, her swords disappeared, her Nexus changed, but if in Adam's case, it was a step toward depth, for Katrin it was coming to the original point of her power.</p><br><p>A dangerous gleam passed along the long blade of the simple-looking scythe. The black handle was rough, rough to grip, and the slightly curved blade was damaged, old-time-worn.</p><br><p>The edge that should have been sharp was shattered, like a common sword after hundreds of fights without a single sharpening.</p><br><p>The Desire Star brought another change - her gaze no longer resembled a wild beast.</p><br><p>Katrin calmed down, she was finally able to do at least something the way she wanted.</p><br><br><p>She stepped forward, passing beside Adam like a shadow. In a split second, she was in front of the Crimson Monarch, making a lightning-fast sweep of her scythe.</p><br><p>But... before she could finish her attack, a layer of stone covered her body, turning her into a statue.</p><br><p>She noticed too late that the snake's amber eyes shone brightly. While it couldn't work on Adam anymore, Katrin had no defense.</p><br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch nodded slightly, guiding his hand to her chest, soon his claws would rip out her heart.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Suddenly, the scythe blade shuddered, releasing thin streams of darkness like the rays of an evil sun.</p><br><p>Acting on instinct, the Crimson Monarch jumped aside, his eyes narrowed, he didn't realize what was happening.</p><br><p>Piece by piece, the stone layer fell away, swept by streams of darkness until Katrin was free from capture.</p><br><p>Her new Nexus, her scythe absorbed the Crimson Monarch's curse, since death could not be petrified.</p><br><p>Katrin's calm eyes darted to the scythe, the blade trembling, eager to return the absorbed power to its original owner in a mortal strike.</p>
