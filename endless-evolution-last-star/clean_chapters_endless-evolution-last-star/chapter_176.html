            <br><p>Adam stared at Silvana as if mesmerized, but not because he was charmed by her beauty or anything like that, no, it had a different, more sublime reason.</p><br><p>Then, he looked at Silvana not like a man at a woman, or even like a Phantom at an Operator, but like a Warrior meeting another Warrior, with the same unwavering, confidence-filled gaze.</p><br><p>Sure, their battlefields were strikingly different, but they could both fight. One with physical force, the other with support and information.</p><br><p>Then Silvana slowly stood up and, without saying a word, punched Adam in the chest with her fist.</p><br><p>Her eyes went wide, but not because of surprise that the damage done was zero - that was expected. Silvana was in pain because hitting Adam was like running into a steel wall.</p><br><p>Adam lowered his eyes, gently took her wrist, and lowered her hand. Without waiting for her words, he walked over and made the simplest of coffees, using the coffee machine - under Silvana's careful gaze.</p><br><p>The whole process took only a few minutes, and the cup of espresso was in Silvana's hand, with knuckles reddened from the impact.</p><br><p>She took a sip, looked at the coffee, and with a calm look, said with a glance at Adam:</p><br><p>"This is just awful. It's better for both of us if I keep doing it." Silvana uttered, but strangely enough took a few more sips, drinking it all down.</p><br><br><p>"I'll take a rest before the party, moreover I still have a conversation with Narata waiting for me. Will that be enough time to find the right Essence Monster?" Adam asked, moving on to something they were both good at - completing missions in Dead Lands.</p><br><p>Silvana nodded. She tried to hide it, but it was obvious that their short conversation, almost without words, gave her relief and peace.</p><br><p>After all, even if they had different statuses in society, they were a team, and it was important that everyone did their jobs and followed their roles.</p><br><p>"Don't worry, though I spent most of my time trying to find a way to get you out of prison, I haven't forgotten about your request. I have several suitable candidates, all of whom possess the lightning attribute. In five days, we'll see what the missions department has to offer."</p><br><p>"Nice. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but I've missed Dead Lands already." Adam said with a sincere glint in his eyes.</p><br><p>Silvana smiled bitterly.</p><br><br><br><p>At about the same time, the only and strongest Warden of the Fall Hill Prison woke up in the medical room.</p><br><p>Prago rose abruptly, in a sweat, as if he had been haunted by a nightmare for a long time. It took him a few minutes to regain consciousness and examine his bandage-covered, scarred body.</p><br><p>'You're finally awake.' A woman's voice rang out, but Prago was alone in the room - the sound came from an earpiece deep in his ear.</p><br><p>"I lost... I lost to the K1-Phantoms... It... it truly happened..." Prago muttered in disbelief, grabbing his face with his hand and looking at the world around him through his fingers.</p><br><p>'Yes. It's a fact. Those three have already left the prison and are enjoying their freedom. Technically, though, already, these three have never been in this prison.'</p><br><p>"Fuck that! It's all fucking bureaucracy! It doesn't change the fact that I lost to them! They beat me! Especially that bastard, Adam Vinter... Why is he so powerful?!" Prago exclaimed furiously, it seemed like anger was about to fill his mind and heart.</p><br><p>For a while, there was only silence, no one said anything. Perhaps this was a bad sign, for Prago's anger was only going to grow and expand.</p><br><p>'Have you spoken out? Are you feeling better?' The girl asked as if such a reaction from Prago was something normal in their case and even commonplace.</p><br><p>Prago sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"Y-Yes, I'm fine. I'm sorry for yelling..." Prago's voice changed drastically as if he was really ashamed.</p><br><p>'That's all right. I know you didn't mean it, but... Prago, maybe it's time to stop trying to run away already?'</p><br><p>Prago didn't answer anything, he only clenched his fists tightly, it was obvious, that it was hard for him to talk about it.</p><br><p>"How...?" Prago's gaze darkened, "On my last mission, I miraculously survived... Even with our medicine, it took me two weeks to recover! I was literally picked up in pieces, and I was the lucky one! The others died immediately, and this has happened many times before!"</p><br><p>Prago was obviously severely traumatized by past tragedies. He had been a Phantom much longer than Adam, Edir, or Kayla, and had seen many more deaths.</p><br><p>It was also the reason why he acted relatively cowardly and safe, though it still couldn't keep him from facing another tragedy. Whoever you were and whatever you did - the Dead Lands was a dangerous place, for any creature.</p><br><p>'We've discussed this many times, so I won't repeat it for the thousandth time. You and I both know that the choice here is clear and simple - either you forget your fears and move forward, or you continue to feel sorry for yourself and rot in prison.'</p><br><p>Prago wanted to say something, but his Operator beat him to it.</p><br><p>'It doesn't matter who you are, warden, guardian, or prisoner, everyone in prison is deprived of their freedom. Anyone who stays in prison too long begins to rot, not on the outside, but on the inside - it's even more dangerous.'</p><br><br><p>'But... Given that you're a Phantom, the entire Citadel serves this function. If a Phantom stays too long in the Citadel, it becomes a prison for him, no different from a normal prison.'</p><br><p>Prago bit his lip, so hard that blood rushed out. He clenched his hands into fists and muttered.</p><br><p>"I want... I want to go back... Find me a suitable mission... And, can I stay with you tonight...?" Prago asked timidly, like a child before his first major test in life.</p><br><p>'Sure. Welcome back.' The girl replied with a happy smile on her face.</p><br><br><br><p>Three days after leaving Fall Hill Prison, Adam was on his way to a simple, unremarkable cafe in Second Ring.</p><br><p>Narata and Tron should have been there by now.</p>
