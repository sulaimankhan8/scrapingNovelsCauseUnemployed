            <br><p>"You're going to lose...? Why did you come to that conclusion? Don't you think you're giving up too soon?"</p><br><p>Osana asked, there was nervousness in her voice. She was relieved when Adam so easily agreed to help her even though he understood her plan and all the risks he was taking, but... none of it made sense if he didn't win using The Rule of Power.</p><br><p>"Look, I understand that when using The Rule of Power, everything happens within the same level. It would be weird if a K1-Phantom deciding to help Light Noble was facing a K3-Phantom." Adam suggested.</p><br><p>Osana nodded. Even though she hadn't mentioned it yet, Adam was right. Otherwise, there would be no point in The Rule of Power, since the strongest in their levels should win due to mastery and talent.</p><br><p>"But, I've only just become a K2-Phantom. Perhaps, if you told me this when I was a K1-Phantom then I would have a good chance, but now..."</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head. He didn't want to talk about it, but he knew how to realistically evaluate the situation.</p><br><p>"If one of the strongest K2-Phantoms comes out against me, I can hardly last even one minute. I mean, remembering what I was like as a K1-Phantom at the beginning of this level and the end... the difference is just monstrous."</p><br><p>Adam continued with a wave of his hand.</p><br><p>"What's more, you said the wedding date is already set. I can't get strong enough in a few days or weeks." Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>Instead of worry or some advice he expected to hear from Osana, Adam got only...</p><br><p>"Hahahahahaha!" Osana suddenly laughed, unable to contain the emotions that burst out of her in a bright stream.</p><br><p>"Hm? Did I say something funny?" Adam was stumped.</p><br><p>Osana shook her head.</p><br><p>"Hey, were you even listening to me? I told you the wedding is in a few months. Do you really think a wedding is some kind of party that can be prepared in a week or a couple of days?"</p><br><p>Adam frowned. He forgot about it, though he didn't think it changed anything drastically.</p><br><p>"Either way, I doubt a few months will be enough. Silvana said there's more and more difference between each level. I don't want to rush and die in Dead Lands because of it, in an attempt to get stronger as fast as possible." Adam shrugged.</p><br><p>He realized he was Osana's only hope, to some extent she was in a desperate situation, but he knew his capabilities and limits.</p><br><p>However... Osana was not disappointed. On the contrary, she had a sly smile on her face, as if everything was under her control again.</p><br><p>''Hah, you don't have to worry about that. I'm sure you'll win, you just don't know how K2-Level works yet."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>Osana waved her hand loosely, a heavy weight had fallen from her shoulders in the last few minutes, allowing her to breathe in relief.</p><br><p>"Sure, I too have only recently become a K2-Phantom, after all, we all received the Midnight Crystal at the same time, but since I'm a noblewoman I know quite a bit about it. I'm sure Silvana will explain and tell you everything. The Operators should know this."</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, Osana spoke up:</p><br><p>"Anyway. I'm sure a few months will be enough for you to become strong enough to defeat a Marzo Family's fighter. But, it won't be easy."</p><br><p>Osana put her hands together as she stared intently at Adam.</p><br><p>"I'm sure you've gained quite a few strong and unique abilities. Right now, you, much like me and any new K2-Phantom, need to progress not on the K2-Level path, but rather learn how to better use your abilities and physical capabilities."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment as he nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"A few months... right?"</p><br><p>Osana stared at Adam for a while, studying his reaction, he seemed to be thinking about something, then she confirmed: "Yes, to be exact, it's in precisely 85 days. That's a little less than three months until the wedding. Like you, I'm going to take that time to better understand my abilities. Simply put, I'm going to practice, well, at least when I have free time."</p><br><p>Adam muttered something to himself, as he smiled weakly, remembering his last battle. It was against Damien, and... he remembered what they had talked about at the end.</p><br><p>"Well, I wanted to take up training and I even have a teacher already. If you're saying I can win if I learn to control my new powers, then fine. In that case, we actually have a good chance of winning by using The Rule of Power."</p><br><p>Osana smiled happily, her eyes sparkling like stars. She didn't know why, but a few words from Adam about his possible victory were enough to make her believe that it already happened.</p><br><p>"Sure, you can do it!" Osana exclaimed with excitement as she clenched her hand tightly into a fist, "I'm sure when you realize the level of power you'll have to fight, you'll see that our chances of success are great!"</p><br><p>Adam shrugged. Until he talked to Silvana to learn more about K2-Level, he wouldn't jump to conclusions.</p><br><p>"Rouzet Family and Marzo Family, they're in second and third wings..." Adam muttered, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.</p><br><p>Then, he cast a glance at Osana.</p><br><p>"There's still something else I want to know about the Twelve Branches. All the great families are located in the nine wings, so... is there a hierarchy between them? I mean, the Marzo Family is located in the second wing and the Balo Family in the eighth wing."</p><br><p>Osana shook her head.</p><br><p>"It's not a question that can be answered easily, but barring some complications that aren't important right now, there's no significant difference."</p><br><p>Osana took a deep breath before continuing:</p><br><p>"Only the Twelve Branches are considered as great families. They are the richest and most powerful nobles who are constantly fighting or working with each other. They compete with each other. There is indeed a difference between ordinary people depending on the wings, but not between the Twelve Branches. They are all at the very top."</p><br><br><p>He realized he didn't know everything about the Twelve Branches yet, but he didn't need to right now.</p><br><p>"Good, then how about we finally get something to eat?" Adam raised an eyebrow looking at the table filled with food.</p><br><p>Osana smirked as she leaned forward.</p><br><p>"Sure, my dear future husband, eat all you want, I'm paying."</p>
