            <br><p>In a moment, a tall silhouette with gray hair and amethyst eyes appeared in Adam's mind - Tron.</p><br><br><p>Because the Blind Commander did to him what Tron was doing for three months. No deadly combat, that was out of the question, just a trial of three strikes, yet before Adam could accomplish anything, he was already outside the spire.</p><br><p>'And... I'm just going to fall now? Do I have to climb up here again?' Adam internally muttered, looking at the serene Blind Commander.</p><br><p>The Blind Commander had no anger towards Adam or desire to humiliate him, he was just doing his job and showing Adam that he had to act by the rules.</p><br><p>Adam couldn't fly and had no way of controlling his fall, but... as his eyes locked onto the pillars, an idea quickly formed in his mind.</p><br><p>"Hah, I'm not going back down! I'm going to stay on top until I get the key!"</p><br><p>With a fiery shout, Adam's eyes shone brightly when two lone threads swept before him, rippling in the gusts of wind.</p><br><p>Throwing his arms forward, the threads followed a trajectory taut as strings, they tied themselves around the two nearest pillars.</p><br><p>"There aren't many places in Dead Lands where you can take advantage of this, but this fortress is more like a city than a monster land."</p><br><br><p>Clenching his fists tightly and pulling on his own, Adam dragged himself to the pillars using his threads as a simple hook.</p><br><p>In most parts of the Pacific Lands, Adam wouldn't be able to do this. Not because there weren't suitable places like the spire, but because his threads would just cut through the pillars like a red-hot knife through butter.</p><br><br><p>Adam found himself on the edge of the platform, as the threads detached themselves from the pillars, quickly dispersing into energy particles.</p><br><p>Only a few scratches remained on the pillars. If Adam wanted to cut the pillar with the threads or his needle, he would need to spend a very long time doing so.</p><br><p>With a wide grin, Adam raised his gaze to the Blind Commander.</p><br><p>"Damn, looks like I have no choice but to beat you at your own game, right?"</p><br><p>In response, the Blind Commander took up his defensive stance again and showed three fingers.</p><br><p>"Yeah, yeah, I know. But from the looks of it, it's not going to be that easy."</p><br><p>Not sparing any ability, Adam immediately activated the First and Second Orders. Adam hoped that the amber grid in his right eye would allow him to see all of Blind Commander's movements, but...</p><br><p>'What the hell...?' Adam blinked a few times trying to figure out what was going on.</p><br><p>Normally, when he used his Second Order, everything was smoother and somewhat slower, and the movements of his opponents were seen with more precision.</p><br><p>However, even though the effect was working at full power, Adam saw no change in the way he viewed the Blind Commander.</p><br><p>'My ability doesn't work on him? No... not really. It doesn't seem to be about speed but how he uses his capabilities... I could see all of his movements before.'</p><br><p>Lost in his thoughts, Adam shook his head before rushing forward, quickly finding himself in front of the Blind Commander.</p><br><p>'Doesn't matter, I don't even need to beat him though I want to. Three strikes... Fuck, it's like I'm fighting against Tron.'</p><br><br><p>A silver needle at high speed crashed down on the Blind Commander, who was staring forward while Adam like a shadow appeared to his left.</p><br><p>The Blind Commander didn't turn his head, he hardly needed to, he wouldn't be able to see Adam anyway.</p><br><p>But... That didn't mean he couldn't notice Adam.</p><br><br><p>The ice sword clashed with the silver needle, cold sparks flying off to the sides, turning into tiny crystals.</p><br><p>Adam held his needle with two hands, while Blind Commander carelessly held the hilt of his sword with one hand.</p><br><p>A dangerous glint passed across Adam's eyes as he attacked a few more times, but the Blind Commander blocked each of his attacks.</p><br><p>The first target was the monster's chest, the easiest place to reach, but the Blind Commander's defense was unbreakable.</p><br><p>In a moment, Adam tossed his needle aside and charged at the Blind Commander with his bare fists.</p><br><p>'If I can't get through your sword, my fists will!'</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the Blind Commander did the same. He didn't copy Adam's actions but voluntarily switched to hand-to-hand combat.</p><br><br><p>The black fists of the gauntlets rained down on the Blind Commander, and in return, they met the pale, cold palms taking each of Adam's punches.</p><br><p>Adam hit full force, he put all his effort into each punch, yet all he could achieve after ten seconds was to make the Blind Commander take a few steps back.</p><br><p>Not intending to lose, Adam decided not to hold back in anything, including his abilities.</p><br><br><p>Instead of throwing the next punch, Adam aggressively slammed his gauntlets against each other.</p><br><br><br><p>He did it again but in a much smoother form.</p><br><p>Thus, red and purple sound waves followed each other, one carrying destruction and the other wanting to plunge the Blind Commander into sleep or deep hypnosis.</p><br><p>Deafening pain reverberated in Adam's arms, but he wasn't about to stop.</p><br><p>'It's okay, the first wave will force him to defend himself, the second will immobilize him for a while. If I do it right I can not only give him three strikes but win!'</p><br><p>Adam was right, the Blind Commander couldn't block sound.</p><br><p>So the first wave stunned him, unable to inflict serious wounds, the second made him lose his orientation in space, shifting his weight uncertainly from one foot to the other.</p><br><p>'This is my moment!' Adam inwardly exclaimed, his fist heading for the Blind Commander's face.</p><br><p>A cold wind blew between them as a wall of thick ice grew out of nowhere, taking the full force of his punch.</p><br><p>"No..." Adam muttered desperately, glaring at the Blind Commander who only swung his arm, deflating all his efforts to nothing.</p><br><p>Anger and frustration reflected on his face, in a strange, frightening expression.</p><br><p>One half of Adam's mouth was in an aggressive growl, while the other half was in grief over his helplessness.</p><br><p>Even Silvana had never seen Adam in such a state, because this was the first time it had ever happened to him.</p><br><p>"FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK!"</p><br><p>With a furious howl echoing around, Adam brought his fist down on the ice wall.</p><br><p>Tiny shards flew aside before his eyes wide open in fury, unable to leave any more damage on the ice wall than a few cracks.</p><br><p>"What's the point of the sound, what's the point of these fists if I can't even break fragile fucking ice!"</p><br><br><p>Two fists slammed into the wall from above, trickles of blood rushing through the gaps in the black gauntlets. Adam's reckless blows inflicted serious damage to his arms despite the protection of his Nexus.</p><br><br><p>Silvana bit her lip, her voice trembling.</p><br><p>'Back off and change tactics... If you continue, you'll just destroy your hands and any chance of winning...'</p><br><p>However, Adam didn't listen to her, he heard nothing but his own thoughts filling his mind like demons.</p><br><p>"Useless... useless... useless..."</p><br><p>Time after time Adam mumbled only one word, which soon for some reason began to echo in his inner space.</p><br><p>'Useless... useless... useless...'</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree trembled, paying attention to Adam's current state.</p><br><p>[Oh... Here comes the end of your winning streak... there's nothing wrong with that... Accept defeat... retreat and come back stronger...]</p><br><p>Despite its impressive wisdom, the Evolution Tree made the same mistake as Silvana - Adam didn't hear it.</p><br><br><p>Adam clenched his fists tightly, staring intently at his gauntlets, his eyes were completely black, deep as a merciless abyss.</p><br><p>Then, he looked up at the Blind Commander, watching his opponent through the solid ice barrier.</p><br><p>"You... The two sound waves couldn't do anything to you... The ground shaking will hardly cause problems for you..."</p><br><p>The blood flowed down the cold wall below, losing all its heat by the end of the path, to Adam's indistinct muttering.</p><br><br><p>Fists slammed into the icy wall again, casting drops on Adam's face of his own blood.</p><br><p>Slowly, without saying anything, Adam looked up, seeing nothing but thick darkness in front of him.</p><br><p>"Yeah... It's useless... This way I can't win... and... this needs to be fixed..."</p><br><p>Suddenly, black particles began to emerge from Adam's body, in large volumes like a powerful stream not intending to stop for a moment.</p><br><p>A frightening shiver went through the Blind Commander's body as he abruptly turned around, shattering his ice wall without a moment's hesitation.</p><br><p>Before Adam could react, was he about to do anything? The Blind Commander's fist slammed right into Adam's face.</p><br><p>The impact threw Adam aside like a projectile.</p><br><br><p>His back slammed into the pillar, he was lucky there was an obstacle in his way since otherwise he would be flying to the bottom of the spire.</p><br><p>However, there was no reaction from Adam, only the black particles that had previously guided him on his way became more and more numerous.</p><br><p>They thickened around him like a fog, partially obscuring his silhouette.</p><br><p>The Blind Commander did not wait, now he was not interested in the challenge, he had only one mission - to destroy the enemy and protect the fortress.</p><br><p>Stomping on the ground, the Blind Commander brought his sword up, in a hard stride heading towards Adam, his brutal aura, making the air shake and the weak monsters below stall in place.</p><br><p>Then, Adam raised his head, glaring at the Blind Commander through the gaps.</p><br><p>"Oh, you have strong weapons, not like me... but... that's about to change..."</p><br><br><p>The particles of darkness merged into a single flow completely covering Adam, hiding him from the Blind Commander's eyes.</p><br><br><p>The Blind Commander ran forward, holding his weapon tightly with both hands, as the world froze... at least to the eternal watcher within. Your next journey awaits at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree trembled, trying to reach Adam, but it seemed impossible.</p><br><p>[Adam! Damn it... What are you doing you fool...! Stop ignoring everyone around you! Your desires will drive you to your grave!]</p><br><p>Perhaps it was the first time the Evolution Tree had ever spoken in a non-calm voice, yet it didn't last long.</p><br><p>Soon, the Evolution Tree fell silent, staring downward in disbelief.</p><br><p>The First Wall shook vigorously, though the Blind Commander was clearly not the monster Adam needed.</p><br><p>It was answering Adam's call.</p><br><p>Soon, two black hands showed out as thick, all-consuming darkness emerged from The First Wall.</p><br><p>[What... What... What are you going to do...? You have no power here!]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree's voice spread throughout the interior, dozens of massive roots infused with energy moved towards the First Wall, in an attempt to stop it.</p><br><p>Yet, before the roots could touch the First Wall they stopped, as if an invisible force was preventing them from going any further.</p><br><p>The reason was that the Two Walls were not connected to the Evolution Tree, yet were part of Adam's inner space.</p><br><p>All the Evolution Tree had to do was helplessly watch events that shouldn't be happening.</p><br><p>The greatest fear of the Evolution Tree was that the First Wall would get out of control, but... it had another purpose, one that even such a magnificent being could not have predicted.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Suddenly, because of the streams of darkness, the seal shuddered, half empty as the First Wall was in its full form.</p><br><p>This awakened the second part of the seal, the Second Wall, which quickly returned to its original size.</p><br><p>The darkness pulled the Second Wall towards itself, close enough for the hands from the First Wall to be able to reach it.</p><br><p>[No... Why... why... why... you are so strong... just like me...]</p><br><p>Under the Evolution Tree's muttering, two dark hands plunged into the depths of the Second Wall, trying to pull something out of there.</p><br><p>Something that Adam would need much later, something he should reach only after the First Wall.</p>
