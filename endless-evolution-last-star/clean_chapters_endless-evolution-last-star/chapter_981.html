            <br><p>Adam and Grita watched Risha's hard training for a while, they watched as she struggled to block the attacks of the three serpents, her axe, and energy not helping her much.</p><br><p>''What about the dark field? Risha was able to reach the center?" Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>The corners of Grita's mouth turned upward. "Yeah, you should have seen it. I, to my shame, fell after a few steps, but she kept walking on. She yelled that if you could do it, then she had to as well.</p><br><p>"Hah, it was painful. I could see it on her face, and her eyes poured in blood, but she did it after all. The powerful pressure made her body stronger, and she, like you, was able to absorb massive amounts of energy, but... her fourth lesser gates are still as hard as steel."</p><br><p>Adam nodded after a few seconds, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.</p><br><p>"Hmm... I don't think we're going to get anywhere this way. Risha has some unfinished business, I doubt that as long as she has this barrier in front of her, she'll be able to break the next gates."</p><br><p>Confusion covered Grita's face, she didn't understand what Adam was talking about.</p><br><p>"What? Care to fill me in on your plans?"</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand, jumping down from the rock. "It's not a big deal. She just needs the External Artifact. Not just its essence that, like soulless energy, takes up space in her inner space, but a true ally and a unique ability."</p><br><p>"But..." she stammered. "Where do we find the External Artifact now? It's not as easy as it might seem, you know?"</p><br><p>"Well, are you blind and can't see that one is right here in front of us!" he pointed to the star-crystal hovering above the dark field.</p><br><p>Grita gasped. She realized that Adam was talking about Radiant Mirage, still... it was a mystery to her what his plan was. Even getting an ordinary artifact wasn't always a simple task, the External Artifact was something much more complicated.</p><br><p>"This, it's unlikely to work. Considering that you forced Radian Mirage to let us through here, maybe he would agree to be your ally. They, as monsters, respect strength, but Risha...?" her face darkened as she clenched her fists. "She's not as powerful as you, Adam."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"It doesn't matter."</p><br><p>Then, without disturbing the other's training, he jumped onto the nearest red pillar, staring intently at the star-crystal.</p><br><p>"Hey, we need to talk, right here, right now."</p><br><p>A few seconds and Radiant Mirage responded, directing streams of energy towards Adam. Among the streams were large mirror fragments, they surrounded Adam, immersing him in the chamber.</p><br><p>He touched his reflection, finding himself in Radiant Mirage's space.</p><br><p>A young man with a great frown on his face emerged from one mirror.</p><br><p>"What do you want?" Radiant Mirage growled. "I heard your conversation with that woman-serpent. If you think you have any chance of persuading me to become an artifact of this weak Phantom girl, I'm not going to agree."</p><br><p>Despite the outright refusal, Adam was not about to give up.</p><br><p>In a calm stride, he headed forward, stopping a few meters away from Radiant Mirage.</p><br><p>"She's not as weak as you think. Moreover, it's not just strength that matters after all, it's just an additional condition. What is truly important is the pact, right?"</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage gritted his teeth but nodded. Adam had experience in this stuff and knew at what points he should push.</p><br><p>"We don't have much time or the right conditions to create an elaborate pact. There is no threat over you other than Arnoth, but Risha certainly won't be able to kill him. So... I want to offer you something else," Adam smiled slyly.</p><br><p>For some reason, Radiant Mirage felt that this could be a good deal for him.</p><br><p>"I understand that you want to ally with a strong Phantom whom you respect as a warrior, and I am offering you the opportunity to get one."</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage frowned, he crossed his arms over his chest.</p><br><p>"How? Maybe in the future, Risha would fit that description, but not now."</p><br><p>Most importantly, he didn't deny Adam's words. For him, that was already half the victory.</p><br><p>"Yeah, Risha isn't ready at the moment, but who knows what will happen in an hour."</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage raised an eyebrow. "Hmm?"</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand. "Invite her in for a talk and offer her the pact with the following conditions: in a fight against you, she must prove herself worthy of you. She must overcome pain and her limits and show through blood and sweat that she is the warrior you seek. If she wins, she gets you as her External Artifact."</p><br><p>"And..." Radiant Mirage muttered. "What if she loses? What if she turns out to be weak, without the will to conquer?"</p><br><p>It was unknown what response Radiant Mirage was expecting, but he got what any External Artifact or monster in his place wanted.</p><br><p>"You can kill her and absorb her, turn every drop of her blood into energy."</p><br><p>A greedy grin covered Radiant Mirage's face, and the cute young man transformed into a conniving demon.</p><br><br><p>Soon, the smirk disappeared, replaced by a lost expression.</p><br><p>"Wait... For this to work, she must agree to these terms. How do we do that?" Radiant Mirage tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Don't worry about that. The important thing is that you are fine with it."</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage nodded, nothing but seriousness in his eyes. No matter what personality an External Artifact had, they all understood the value and importance of the pact.</p><br><p>"Good," Adam chuckled, a hint of gloom filling his voice. "It will be a worthy spectacle."</p><br><p>Then, Adam took a step back, dissolving into the bright light of the mirrors like a ghost.</p><br><p>Left alone in his small world, Radiant Mirage shook his head disapprovingly.</p><br><p>"This Phantom... First, he ruined my reputation in front of serpents, and now he's forcing me to be partners with some aggressive girl."</p><br><br><p>"Agh... She better not disappoint me. Otherwise, I'll have to wait a long time for someone worthy."</p><br><br><br><p>Risha repelled Vorx's attack, causing him to jump back.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Torz attacked her right, but a shadow appeared between them out of nowhere.</p><br><p>With a slight movement, Adam stopped Torz with a firm grip on his wrist.</p><br><br><p>"What, you're awake already?"</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, and I have a proposition for you. Hehehe, you're going to love it."</p>
