            <br><p>Adam remembered vividly the many conditions he had to fulfill to create the First Key.</p><br><p>The difference between that situation and this one was that Adam knew immediately what to do for the First Key.</p><br><p>However, at K2-Level, only after destroying the Two Walls, did Adam have the opportunity to touch the Lock.</p><br><p>One of the three keyholes had disappeared, leaving only two unfinished. The mighty chains concealed their presence, but Adam could feel them, restraining the growth of his Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>This became especially obvious when he came closer to the Lock.</p><br><p>Moira and Lone Blaze made no move to reveal themselves. They stayed in Adam's Inner Gene because they understood that he didn't need their help right now.</p><br><p>They had no way of affecting the Lock or the creation of the Second Key.</p><br><br><p>Walking through the darkness, Adam stood before the Lock, with a short sigh he closed his eyes. He directed his energy towards the second keyhole, causing it to shudder slightly.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, a familiar mechanical voice echoed in his head, coming from the depths of the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>[The Second Keyhole can be created, the distance traveled is great enough.]</p><br><p>[The echoes of the destroyed walls will become the key's frame and its movement, yet it is necessary to accumulate enough pure energy, coming straight from the Evolution Tree.]</p><br><p>At the same moment, hundreds of tiny stars appeared in the air, hovering amidst the vast darkness.</p><br><p>Adam turned around sharply as the elongated frame of his future key reflected in his eyes.</p><br><p>The Second Key was far from its completion. Adam didn't begin to fill it with energy yet, but the outline of a long key remotely resembling a heavenly arrow was evident.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Adam nodded slightly. He was going to fill the Second Key with his energy right now, but something was holding him back, scrabbling deep inside.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Does it have to be like this? I just need to use some energy and I'm done?'</p><br><p>A faint frown covered his face.</p><br><p>'I've dealt with the Two Walls and the Star Seal, still... Something's not right. It looks too simple.'</p><br><p>Pushing the excess thoughts aside, Adam stepped forward and held out his hand.</p><br><p>He didn't know exactly what he needed to do, but it was his inner space. He could channel his energy into any part of it.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree shuddered, releasing streams of dense energy going straight to the Second Key.</p><br><p>Confidence was visible on Adam's face. His energy was never so dense before, now he felt he could quickly create the Second Key.</p><br><br><p>Even though the white streams disappeared one by one into the Second Key, spreading out among the hundreds of stars, nothing happened.</p><br><p>Adam blinked a few times to make sure he wasn't imagining things.</p><br><p>'This is weird... Am I doing something wrong? No, the energy is definitely reaching the Second Key. At the very least, the Evolution Tree would tell me I made a mistake, after all, I'm taking energy from it.'</p><br><p>Deciding not to panic early, Adam continued to use his energy.</p><br><p>The stars glittered, showing their activity, changes were taking place with the Second Key, yet Adam saw no progress.</p><br><p>After ten minutes, Adam felt weak. He used the same amount of energy as he did against the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."</p><br><p>Heavy breathing and an exhausted gaze were all Adam achieved. He stared at the Second Key, hoping he just had to wait, but even after half an hour, nothing happened to the stars.</p><br><p>Then, the Evolution Tree finally spoke up:</p><br><p>[You should rest... You've used most of your energy... If you continue at this pace, you'll just pass out...]</p><br><p>Adam's eyes darted upwards.</p><br><p>"B-But! What the hell else am I supposed to do?!"</p><br><p>His indignation was clear. He had no other instructions.</p><br><p>[For the beginning, look at your progress...].</p><br><p>Adam shouted something after the Evolution Tree, but it departed, leaving Adam alone with himself.</p><br><p>"Look at the progress? Fine..."</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, trying to see something in the Second Key.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, particles of energy soon appeared in front of him, forming symbols he could understand.</p><br><p>The mechanical voice sounded again:</p><br><p>[The Second Key, energy filling stage: 0.0003%]</p><br><p>A coldness ran down Adam's back while shivers crowded his body. His pupils dilated in disbelief.</p><br><p>The number he saw in front of him was negligible. It wasn't zero, however, in the vast majority of cases it would be no different from nothing.</p><br><p>'Is this some kind of mistake...?' the first thing Adam thought.</p><br><p>However, he realized that it wasn't. In an attempt to find an answer, Adam turned to the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>"Hey, hurry up and explain what the hell is going on here?!"</p><br><p>There was no response. The Evolution Tree simply disappeared.</p><br><p>Before Adam could get any more angry, a storming flame reflected in the corner of his eye. A red star was moving towards him, leaving his Initial Gene.</p><br><p>Adam blinked as Lone Blaze appeared before him, her gaze serious.</p><br><p>"I think I wouldn't be wrong in assuming you need help."</p><br><p>Still irritated, Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>"You know what I'm doing wrong? How do I create the Second Key!"</p><br><p>Lone Blaze flinched slightly. If Adam got enraged she wouldn't be able to stop him, but it would be a lot of trouble for her.</p><br><p>Lowering her eyes, she shook her head.</p><br><p>"I don't know what the problem is or all the details of the process, but I can help you calculate how long it will take you. Also, I'm sure there are ways to speed it up somehow."</p><br><p>"Fine, let's do it."</p><br><p>Without further ado, Lone Blaze's eyes lit up, and her aura intensified. For a while, she looked at Adam, then at the Second Key frame.</p><br><p>"I see... Adam, I think you've already calculated everything, but... should I tell you how long it will cost you?"</p><br><p>Adam nodded confidently, this was important, there was no running away.</p><br><br><p>Lone Blaze gulped, it seemed she, herself, couldn't believe what she was going to say.</p><br><p>"One thousand years..."</p>
