            <br><p>At the same time, Adam, Risha, and the Inferno Serpent were floating on the lava river, heading forward in an almost straight line.</p><br><p>In a strange way, the splashes of lava and the warm wind currents hitting their faces created a soothing atmosphere.</p><br><p>Adam could breathe a sigh of relief, recovering from the long battle, it was a minor part, but he already felt better.</p><br><p>"So..." he muttered, caressing the Inferno Serpent on his scales. "We're on our way, a few minutes of complete silence. Don't you think it's time to tell me everything?"</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent nodded deeply. He realized that the time came, it had to be done and it was better to happen before they arrived at the Fallen Ring Castle.</p><br><p>"I think I should start by introducing myself to you again. In front of you both since Risha has found the courage to embark on a dark journey..." the Inferno Serpent muttered.</p><br><p>Risha tilted her head in a baffled manner. "Hmm? I don't mean to be rude, but we know a lot about your kind and specifically you thanks to our Operators."</p><br><p>"Sure, I'm aware of that," the Inferno Serpent nodded, parting the lava streams with his nose. "However, that's not what I'm talking about. Unlike you, Adam understood what I meant, didn't he?"</p><br><p>In response, Adam nodded deeply. "Yeah... You're not the first monster in my history to start this topic this way. I know what you're going to do next. Go ahead. Speak up, I'll be glad to find out."</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"My name is Vorx. That's how my folk address me and now I want you to use that name instead of my title in your databases... Considering how far things went, that would be more appropriate."</p><br><p>Risha gasped. Unlike Adam who had once heard the monster's real name, for her, it was the first time. When she was a K2-Phantom, she never encountered anyone as strong as the Crimson Monarch. At the K3 level, her limit was S3 monsters. They weren't powerful enough to develop the ability to speak and have their own name.</p><br><br><p>With a slight smile on his face, Adam patted Vorx's head.</p><br><br><p>Risha nodded. "Ghm... Me too..."</p><br><p>"So, Vorx..." Adam began. "Tell me what happened to your folk, who your master is, and why the place we're going is called the Fallen Ring Castle? I'm sorry, but my Operator already informed me that the name has been changed. It used to be just Ring Castle, didn't it?"</p><br><p>"Hah, you humans..." Vorx stammered. "You always find out what you need to know even when you're not asked. Although I have to admit, sometimes it makes things a lot easier. I'll start with my folk."</p><br><p>Adam and Risha nodded. The long road and the silence, broken only by bursts of lava, was the perfect environment to immerse in the story of a new friend.</p><br><p>"The Ring Castle was something of a settlement for monsters of my kind. As far as I know, you generally refer to us as just serpents, or snakes, or even lizards, but for my kind, I prefer the Serpent Folk."</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Adam rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Are you saying that at the Fallen Ring Castle, there are a lot of serpents like you?"</p><br><p>Vorx nodded slightly. "That's right. I am not the only one, but one of the strongest. That's why our new master sent me out to find a Phantom worthy of battle."</p><br><p>"Your master just wants to fight someone? Why not you?" Adam raised an eyebrow. "And... If it's just that, you should have told me directly earlier. I'd hardly have said no."</p><br><p>With a brief pause, Vorx continued. "Adam, it's not that simple. My master is Arnoth, Crusader of the Lost Light, and is an S5 monster, I've told you that before. His goal is to advance to the next level. Phantoms and monsters, we all want to evolve. However, with each stage, it becomes more and more difficult to do so. I think you both know what I mean."</p><br><p>Sure, for Adam and Risha, it became a part of life. On their way to K3 level, they had to break their limits many times.</p><br><p>"Bottom line. I was obliged to test your strength before I told you the nature of the invitation. I noticed you back when you were fighting against the lizards. No offense, but out of the two of you, only Adam had a chance to make me tense up during the fight," Vorx said as he glanced at Risha.</p><br><p>Risha puffed up her cheeks and crossed her arms over her chest, saying nothing.</p><br><p>"The Phantom wasn't meant to be weak, but neither is too strong."</p><br><p>The last words stumped Adam. "Too strong? Is such a thing possible? I mean, Arnoth, this S5 monster is one of the most dangerous opponents for K3-Phantoms."</p><br><p>"Well, if a K4-Phantom were to descend to this level, I wouldn't risk calling it out. Not only because it would violate my master's orders, but also because it would be tantamount to the death of my folk."</p><br><br><p>Vorx's gaze grew darker. "Either K4-Phantom would kill everyone, or Arnoth would. I doubt any K4-Phantom would decide to help me and listen to me like you did. To hope for that would be too naive."</p><br><p>"Got it," Adam nodded as he swung his arm. "So I fit all the parameters as an opponent for Arnoth?"</p><br><p>"Wait!" Risha exclaimed, her aura intensifying. "Vorx, despite your intentions... All of what you're saying right now sounds like a trap. Once we arrive at the Fallen Ring Castle then you'll hand Adam over to Arnoth and his subordinates to be torn apart, won't you?"</p><br><p>With a long pause, Vorx shook his head.</p><br><p>"That will not happen. If you don't believe me you can jump off me right now I won't stop you."</p><br><p>No one moved, but Risha maintained her suspicious expression. "Then explain why this isn't a trap?"</p><br><p>"Sure. Arnoth wants to fight a Phantom who can give him a decent fight and in the end absorb the power of that Phantom to reach the next level."</p><br><p>Vorx's gaze grew deeper, full of determination and hatred.</p><br><p>"This does not suit me or my folk, so we will proceed with my plan.</p><br><p>"Me and my folk will prepare Adam for battle - we need nothing but victory."</p>
