            <br><p>What did Adam know about the K2-Phantoms?</p><br><p>Well, not much at all. He had seen Tron use his ability once when he was still a K2-Phantom.</p><br><p>Also, Adam had fought Prago, a real K2-Phantom, but at the time Prago was at his worst morally.</p><br><p>Physically he was a K2-Phantom, but inside he was getting weaker by the day as he continued to rot from the inside because of his fears. The defeat brought him to his senses, but he couldn't demonstrate all that K2-Phantom was capable of. Well, that was why he had lost that day.</p><br><p>The K2-Phantoms had to fight against the Yellow Threat Monsters and travel to distant territories that even with the SH-01 fighter, would take quite a while to reach.</p><br><p>And, to do that, they needed decent combat power.</p><br><p>Not everyone was as capable as Adam as a K1-Phantom to fight against Light Yellow Monsters and win. Many K1-Phantoms became K2-Phantoms as soon as they had the opportunity.</p><br><p>Sure, getting Midnight Crystal wasn't easy, but it usually didn't happen like in Adam's case. The Phantoms would contact the missions department, get a team, and go get the Midnight Crystal in a suitable Midnight Zone where there were no opponents of the Plague Reaper's level.</p><br><p>The Citadel didn't strongly approve of such a rush by the Phantoms, but the government wasn't going to stop them.</p><br><p>In the end, everyone chose their own path.</p><br><br><p>Particles of light, like tiny flames flew off to the sides as Adam opened his eyes after a bright flash that eclipsed everything.</p><br><br><p>There were two doors in front of Adam.</p><br><p>There was no Evolution Tree, Vault, or his Nexus with the Artifact around, only vast darkness remaining.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide staring at the two unusual doors. Strangely enough, though the doors were closed, he could see what lurked behind them - the paths.</p><br><p>Behind the left door was a long bright path, a road of dense white energy that in the distance abruptly broke off into darkness. But, that only meant that the path was persistent, straight, and deep with some definite purpose and limitations.</p><br><p>At least that was what Adam sensed.</p><br><p>The snow-white path was as straight as a perfect line, and from its edges rose transparent walls of energy, white particles constantly flying off to disappear into the darkness.</p><br><p>Then, Adam looked at the right door.</p><br><p>The second path was completely different from the first. It was twisted and curved, dividing into many trails like random branches in a great tree.</p><br><p>And, at the same place as the first path, dozens of trails disappeared into the darkness.</p><br><p>While the first path was strict and straight, showing its power and depth, the second path displayed a variety of possibilities and flexibility, though none of the trails were as magnificent as the first path.</p><br><br><p>He wasn't prepared for this as he didn't know what he was supposed to expect at all.</p><br><p>But, something was pretty obvious. He had to make a choice, there were only two options, it seemed like nothing complicated, but the weight of that decision was truly immense.</p><br><p>His future depended on it, so Adam had to think properly.</p><br><p>"Well... surely I should take some time and immerse myself in thought, right? But, why?" Adam shrugged nonchalantly before stepping forward.</p><br><p>As soon as he saw the two paths, he sensed which one he should go to. Adam was not stupid, so he knew roughly what the difference between the paths was supposed to be.</p><br><p>Perhaps that was why he didn't have any doubts about his choice. He knew what kind of Phantom he wanted to be, he understood his personality and what he lacked to survive in Dead Lands.</p><br><p>The victory over Plague Reaper, which was almost a defeat, had taught him a lot. Perhaps without that step in his journey, he would have chosen a different door.</p><br><br><p>Adam took the last step stopping in front of the door.</p><br><p>Then, he reached forward and opened it, stepping to the left, straight and stern path.</p><br><p>A flash of light swept around him, defining his choice before the two paths disappeared into the darkness with Adam.</p><br><p>[You have chosen the Immersion Door!]</p><br><p>[Prepare yourself, your evolution is evolving according to your current records and the choices you've made!]</p><br><p>A familiar voice sounded in Adam's head as his eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, energy began to flow out of his body in the real world.</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, not hearing that behind her the mechanical doors opened, letting a tall, broad-shouldered figure inside.</p><br><br><p>A heavy hand fell on Silvana's shoulder sending shivers throughout her body.</p><br><p>Silvana turned around sharply, seeing a man in a dark military suit, black hair, and a short beard.</p><br><p>"Mr. Douglas...?" Silvana muttered, clearly confused.</p><br><p>"Hey, straighten your back and hands at the hips, there's a highly ranked military officer in front of you." Douglas said with a kind smile on his face.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide as she quickly followed his orders. Douglas was a simple man, but the difference in their statuses was vast.</p><br><p>If she was the assistant of a talented warrior, then Douglas was a marshal who held the will and power of thousands of military men with his strong fist and steadfast aura.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, relax, after all, I'm not your boss." Douglas laughed with his mighty, low voice. He didn't expect Silvana to actually follow his orders quickly.</p><br><p>Then, Douglas stepped forward, holding his hands behind his back.</p><br><p>"The one whose orders you are obligated to fulfill is right in front of us, never forget that. He is your highest priority." Douglas said calmly.</p><br><p>Silvana blinked a few times before nodding, a slight smile appearing on her face.</p><br><p>"Yes, I know that. Did you really come here just to remind me of something I'll never forget?"</p><br><p>Silvana said confidently, standing up next to Douglas and crossing her arms over her chest. Despite her words, she knew why Douglas had come here - he wanted to watch Adam's evolution.</p><br><p>"Looks like I got here just in time. He's already created the Key and opened the first keyhole, but... what path did he choose?" Douglas frowned, thickening his brows.</p><br><p>This was important since each Phantom's choice might be slightly different. Doors and their paths were adjusted to suit the possible developments based on the experience and features of their owner, their Phantom.</p><br><p>But, globally, there were two paths between which every Phantom who went from K1 to K2 made a choice.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Enjoy more content from empire</p><br><p>The energy coming out of Adam was calm, enveloping him like a veil, but as soon as he chose the door, his path, everything changed completely.</p><br><p>The energy streams shuddered, quickly transforming into a rectangular beam of energy rushing upwards, towards ceilings several dozen meters high.</p><br><br><p>Silvana's legs crumpled as she suddenly dropped to one knee, unable to stand. Adam's energy, just crushed her to the ground, a simple person like her couldn't stand it.</p><br><p>"Oh, I see..." Douglas muttered thoughtfully rubbing his chin.</p><br><p>Silvana jerked her head up sharply, staring at Douglas wide-eyed.</p><br><p>'What the hell...? He didn't even flinch!'</p><br><p>Silvana couldn't believe that Douglas was standing confidently on his feet. He only looked at Adam curiously.</p><br><p>"Hehehehe, I see... Considering the kind of person you're becoming, that was a good choice! Hahahahaha!"</p><br><p>Douglas laughed, clearly pleased with Adam's choice.</p><br><p>His laughter echoed around him, but Adam heard nothing.</p><br><p>He watched his Evolution Tree grow, but unlike last time, no new unique branches appeared.</p><br><p>But... two branches began to be covered with new, more powerful, and deeper runes and the entire inner space trembled in preparation to completely change every aspect within itself, not just the Evolution Tree.</p>
