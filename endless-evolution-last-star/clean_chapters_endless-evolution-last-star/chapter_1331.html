            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1331: Arrival of Flame and Dead Cold</strong></p><br><p>Despite Adam’s fighting spirit, Misty was right about one thing—even he couldn’t progress too quickly.</p><br><p>Well, compared to his usual pace, he was already doing so, but for him, it was quite a long time, since before that, all training or battles took place over a few weeks, at most a month, and that was the longest he was prepared for.</p><br><p>Clang. Clang. Clang.</p><br><p>One swing after another, Adam and Misty quickly swung their weapons, blocking each other’s attacks. Neither of them could be called experienced swordsmen, as it was not their specialty, but there was no great need for it in their line of work.</p><br><p>Adam tried to attack as hard and accurately as he could, using his sword at maximum speed.</p><br><p>Misty responded by gradually increasing her strength level, taking one small step forward every few days, which was impressive progress in itself.</p><br><br><p>In an attempt to surpass his previous result, Adam lunged forward, wanting to attack Misty from the side, but as always, she was ready for it.</p><br><p>The glint from the tip of the umbrella was the last thing Adam saw before he found himself on the ground.</p><br><p>“Not bad, I think we can call it a day,” Misty said calmly, glancing at Adam lying on the ground.</p><br><p>He didn’t try to get up because he realized that this round was over, and he had no desire to continue.</p><br><p>“Same as always?” Misty asked, even though she already knew the answer.</p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily. “Yeah… 80%. I can’t get any further. I mean, the threads keep weaving together, but at this rate, it’ll take me a year to get to 90%.”</p><br><p>“Hmm, maybe we should just keep going. Even if your progress is fast, it doesn’t mean you always move at the same speed. Sooner or later, you reach a temporary plateau.”</p><br><p>“Nah, it’s been a whole month, almost two and a half, since I woke up. I’m spending too much time on this. Damn… I fought Ureyn three months ago, and I’m still at the same level!” Adam slammed his fist on the ground.</p><br><p>Misty narrowed her eyes as she studied his aura.</p><br><p>“The same level, you say? If you faced Ureyn now, at your current level, you would defeat him in a few attacks.”</p><br><p>Then, Adam’s eyes widened as a decision came to him.</p><br><br><p>“Hmm, yes?” She raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>A fire lit up in Adam’s eyes.</p><br><p>“What is Karso doing now? Maybe if I fight him, I can speed up my progress like you did after Narica?”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Misty took this suggestion calmly.</p><br><p>“That sounds effective, but Karso isn’t as calculating as Narica, and certainly not as calculating as I am. Fighting him could put you in a difficult position. He’s not the type to let you win for the sake of your progress.”</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand dismissively.</p><br><p>“That’s not a problem. I only have 20% left. I have to do it in the next two weeks or I’ll get depressed and actually reach my mental limit.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Misty nodded.</p><br><p>“Fine, I’ll contact Karso. He’s not at the Forgotten Mills right now, but I don’t think he’ll turn down this offer.”</p><br><br><p>A day later, Adam stood alone in the middle of the field in front of Norax’s mill. Only the wind was his companion.</p><br><p>Norax, Narica, and Misty watched from the top of the mill—all of them waiting for Karso, who was due to arrive any minute.</p><br><p>“Sir, do you really think it’s a good idea to let Karso fight Adam?” Narica asked.</p><br><p>He nodded deeply, his eyes sparkling with anticipation.</p><br><p>“Actually, I wanted to see this from the beginning, but Adam was too weak. Sure, he’s too weak against any of us, but Karso won’t hold back even if he lowers his power level to that of an Elder. He’s even more chaotic and reckless than me or Adam.”</p><br><p>Misty, who was standing next to Norax and drinking coffee, took a short sip.</p><br><p>“I told him the same thing, but it seems to have only increased his desire. Boss, you should know that even though I set up the meeting, I’m not sure Karso will come. You know him, he’s always late, he confuses places, dates, and so on. If it weren’t for us, he would have been lost in this world long ago.”</p><br><p>“Hah, what is, is. However, I think Karso will come. When else will he have the opportunity to fight the Phantom we’re sending to the Silver Beacon?”</p><br><p>Misty glanced to the side.</p><br><p>“Doing this in the last year before the World Wipe? Boss, your desire to always do everything at the last minute will one day lead you to trouble.”</p><br><p>“Nah.” He waved his hand dismissively. “I’ve heard that a hundred times in my life. Everything will be fine.”</p><br><p>Adam frowned. He didn’t know what they were talking about, they were too high up, but he could feel their eyes on him.</p><br><p>“Tsk, where is he?!” Adam grunted irritably. “I’ve been waiting for him for two hours!”</p><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana’s voice rang out.</p><br><br><br><p>Without warning, the dark, jagged clouds began to glow red from a bright flash the size of a meteor moving straight toward the field.</p><br><p>The bright flame tore through the clouds, clearing a path for itself as something crashed down with a deafening explosion right in front of Adam.</p><br><p>Shards flew off to the sides, whizzing past his face. His gaze was fixed ahead, already sensing an aura, but not one, but two. However, one of them was as bright as a flame, while the other was gradually fading.</p><br><br><p>Drops of thick blood fell to the ground as a gust of wind revealed Karso behind the smoke screen.</p><br><p>“What the…?” Adam’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br><p>Karso looked the same as when they last met, with a broad smile on his face, but on his shoulder was the huge head of a lizard, no, a real wyvern, with cold scales and deep eyes that were once full of life and ancient coldness.</p><br><p>“Hey!” Karso waved his hand. “I’m a little late, but I’m ready to start!”</p>
