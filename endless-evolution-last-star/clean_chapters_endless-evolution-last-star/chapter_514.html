            <br><p>Adam and Silvana had a strange feeling about Franz, he wasn’t rude or arrogant, he was polite and quite tactful, and his intelligence was obvious.
</p><br><p>But... neither Adam nor Silvana could escape the feeling that Franz harbored danger, but he didn’t show it directly, all his words, questions, and speeches revolved around something specific but never went too far.
</p><br><p>He was like an experienced tamer who knew his limits and what he needed to do not to anger the beast, but to get the emotions and the desired reaction from it.
</p><br><p>At least that’s how it was until that point.
</p><br><p>"What did you just say...?" Adam let out a creepy wheeze, staring intently at Franz.
</p><br><p>He tried to keep his aura under control, but with emotions raging inside him in a furious whirlwind, it was hardly possible.
</p><br><p>"A-Adam..." Silvana said in a trembling voice, looking around, "I think you need to calm down, please."
</p><br><p>The fluctuations in his aura couldn’t go unnoticed, the common people got goosebumps and fear lurked in their hearts, and the Phantoms were wary.
</p><br><p>Moreover, some people were unhappy with the way Adam behaved in front of the high nobleman.
</p><br><p>"Calm down? Like I’m going to do that when someone threatens my family." Adam gritted his teeth, burning Franz with a glare.
</p><br><br><p>"Oh, you think I’m threatening your family? How sweet."
</p><br><p>Adam clenched his fists tightly, gritting his teeth.
</p><br><p>"You think you can mock me after what you said?"
</p><br><p>Franz only shrugged in response before he leaned his body forward and took a step forward moving away from the table.
</p><br><br><p>Purple lines appeared around Franz as if copying his silhouette, tracing his every curve and muscle with perfect precision, not forgetting the details of his loose clothing.
</p><br><p>Adam’s right hand tensed as he was about to make the first move.
</p><br><br><p>Following his copy of the purple lines that echoed even the features of his face, Franz, as if by magic appeared right in front of Adam.
</p><br><p>A delicate palm was facing Adam when a knuckle lightly tapped his forehead.
</p><br><br><p>Just once, a purple ripple went through Adam’s body, then his blue eyes lost all light, becoming empty.
</p><br><p>Adam started to fall as if he instantly went into a deep sleep.
</p><br><p>As soon as Silvana realized that something was wrong with Adam, she immediately rushed to him.
</p><br><p>Her hands reached out to Adam, wanting to grab his shoulders to keep him from falling hard. At that moment, one second after the Franz touch, Adam’s eyes came back to normal, his body quickly regaining control and returning his balance.
</p><br><p>With disbelief in his gaze, Adam slowly, turned around staring at Franz, who at this time was nonchalantly lowering a caramelized cherry into his mouth. Experience new tales on empire
</p><br><p>"What was that...?" Adam was baffled, he never experienced anything like that before.
</p><br><p>Franz shrugged his shoulders.
</p><br><p>"Hey, I told you this was a conversation between Phantoms. You’re a Phantom, Silvana isn’t, so... for my words to make sense someone else has to be a Phantom."
</p><br><p>Adam took a deep breath as he narrowed his eyes staring intently at Franz.
</p><br><p>’Right... I don’t know what he’s up to, but he’s not someone’s pawn and he’s acting on his initiative. That means he has that opportunity, he has a certain power, which means he’s a Light Noble, a Phantom like me.’
</p><br><p>Franz shook off his hands before taking the random waiter’s glass of wine from the tray. The waiter didn’t even notice anything.
</p><br><p>"Anyway, I’d think about the consequences if I were you."
</p><br><p>Adam turned around, getting ready to leave.
</p><br><p>"I’m not going to talk with someone who threatens my family. I don’t know what you have to say about the slums, but forget it, I’m not interested."
</p><br><p>Franz’s facial expression remained calm, even though his target was hurriedly moving out of his sight.
</p><br><p>"You got angry because you thought I was threatening your family, that’s commendable, but you’re wrong." Franz’s subdued voice boomed out, reaching Adam’s ears.
</p><br><p>Adam didn’t bother to stop, but his step became noticeably slower, indecision and doubt in his actions evident in him.
</p><br><p>"I’m not threatening, on the contrary, I’m offering to protect your family, well... that was literally what I said." Franz snorted carelessly as if he was talking about something routine.
</p><br><br><p>Franz noticed this, but it had no effect on his next words, he would have said it even if Adam had decided to run away at full speed.
</p><br><p>"I’m just as interested in protecting your family as I am in developing the slums thanks to Yellow Shark, but... without you, none of this is possible."
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes went wide at Franz’s last words.
</p><br><p>To most people living in the Three Rings, Yellow Shark didn’t make any sense, but to Adam, it was just as much as to anyone trying to survive in the slums and make a life for themselves.
</p><br><p>The Yellow Shark was the most popular grocery store chain in the slums and at the same time the most decent option the slum dwellers could afford.
</p><br><p>It seemed that a high noble like Franz, one of the Twelve Branches, shouldn’t be interested in a chain store in the slums. Franz shouldn’t know about the existence of such a store at all.
</p><br><p>But... he was Franz Balo, and it was the Balo Family who were the only and rightful owners of the entire company of the Yellow Shark, every store belonged to them.
</p><br><br><p>Adam abruptly turned around and approached Franz with a menacing look.
</p><br><p>"Stop messing with me. You came out of nowhere, talking in riddles and not even trying to explain the situation."
</p><br><p>"Is that so?" Franz glanced at Adam with an innocent look, "I’ve already told you everything. I want you to act on the Balo Family’s side, of course, primarily you’re doing this to help Osana De Rouzet avoid her fate as Nirosh Marzo’s fiancée."
</p><br><p>Adam wanted to say something, but Franz wasn’t going to stop anymore. He achieved what he wanted and now Adam had only one option - to keep listening until everything became clear.
</p><br><p>"You disrupt the plans of two great families, and you think they won’t want revenge on you? I’m sure you’ll be safe, as some really powerful people are interested in you, they’ll make sure no one touches you personally, but only you."
</p><br><p>Franz took a short pause, allowing Adam to comprehend what he heard.
</p><br><p>Adam said nothing, but his eyes went wide with shock as if he realized how stupid and shortsighted he was.
</p><br><p>"Not being able to hurt you will only increase their desire to hurt someone else, first on the list is your family and... I doubt anyone considers them as valuable as you."
</p><br><p>"Fuck, I didn’t want to believe such petty bastards could sit among the Twelve Branches." Adam clenched his fists, gritting his teeth in anger since he realized Franz’s words were probably true.
</p><br><br><p>Silvana stepped forward and put a hand on Adam’s shoulder, but her grip was not gentle, rather firm and hard, bringing him to his feet.
</p><br><p>"What about the slums and Yellow Shark? Let’s not pretend you’re just a really nice guy and want to help poor people. Are you blackmailing us knowing Adam came from the slums?" Silvana’s gaze was sharp, not about to give a slack in front of Franz, even despite his status.
</p><br><p>Franz’s raised his head arrogantly, running his fingers along his chin.
</p><br><p>"Blackmail? No, it’s not blackmail at all, it’s motivation. I assure you, when you learn all the details you’ll realize that this deal benefits all of us."
</p><br><p>Then, Franz spread his hands apart.
</p><br><p>"Only the Marzo and Rouzet Families will be in the failure, but..."
</p><br><p>Franz grinned widely and his eyes narrowed, curving slightly as if on a demon mask.
</p><br><p>"That’s not a problem for us, right?"</p>
