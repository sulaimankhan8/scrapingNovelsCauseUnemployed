            <h4>Chapter 1047: Dark Sky (Part 2)</h4><br><p>Without a second thought, Adam used the Stellar Resonance, getting from Silvana all the power she could give him.
</p><br><p>If it were the Cave Grid or the Wild Lands, Adam wouldn’t be in a hurry. He would definitely take some time to study his opponent and see what the stone flower was capable of.
</p><br><p>But if lives were at stake, even Adam could get serious in an instant.
</p><br><br><p>Chasing the wisps of black mist, he rushed forward. Adam ran as fast as he could. Moreover, there were almost no obstacles in his path, for the bottom of the gorge was a straight line.
</p><br><p>Now, neither Arnoth, nor Kreyna, nor anyone else could keep up with him. There were hardly many K3-Phantoms who could keep up with his current speed.
</p><br><br><br><p>A stone vine slammed into the ground in front of him, whizzing right over his shoulder.
</p><br><p>Adam turned around only to see a hail of stone leaves heading towards him.
</p><br><p>There were no magical abilities, destructive flames, or light. Just speed and pure physical strength allow the stone flower to move fast enough. Its vines were like beaks poking into the wall of the ravine, aiming its large body straight at the unfortunate human.
</p><br><br><p>Adam’s frame shuddered as he bounced aside. Dozens of leaves rained down on the ground like blades, scattering splinters to the side.
</p><br><p>With a black flash, the first needle appeared in Adam’s right hand, but before he could make an attack, the vine was in front of his face.
</p><br><p>’Shit!’ Adam internally exclaimed as he managed to put up a block at the last moment.
</p><br><br><p>Strangely enough, the stone vine was not damaged by the collision with the needle blade, instead, several pieces broke off the edge.
</p><br><p>The impact threw Adam far forward, half the distance he traveled. Then, the stone flower burst forward, opening its bud wide.
</p><br><p>A multitude of amber eyes appeared inside, peering curiously at Adam. It seemed that to meet someone like that was a rarity in this place.
</p><br><p>Amidst the eyes, a round jaw appeared, several rows of teeth surrounding the amber crystal, quickly accumulating light.
</p><br><p>’Adam! Dodge!’ Silvana’s scream echoed in his head.
</p><br><p>Well, he was well aware of it himself.
</p><br><br><p>Adam plunged the needle into the wall, stopping abruptly and jumping up from his weapon to latch onto a protruding rock.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, a dense laser passed beneath him, covering the bottom of the gorge in a cascade of explosions.
</p><br><p>Adam gulped, staring at the aftermath of just one energy-using attack.
</p><br><p>One thing was clear - he couldn’t stay here or spend all his trump cards to deal with the stone flower. Perhaps he would have won. No, that would happen if he used the Imaginary Cut or the path, but Adam couldn’t afford to be so reckless.
</p><br><p>"Fuck, this isn’t what I expected at all. Running away from a flower? That’s just embarrassing!" Adam gritted his teeth, gathering energy at his fingertips.
</p><br><p>Preparing himself for the slight pain, Adam thrust his fingers like claws into the solid wall and quickly crawled upwards. Where he could, he bounced off the bulging rocks, hoping that the stone flower wouldn’t follow him to the very top.
</p><br><br><p>Adam touched the edge, climbing to the top of the gorge. He didn’t have time to look around before he spotted two silhouettes, beasts with thick gray skin and muscular builds. Their green, deep-set eyes headed in the direction of the noise to see the unknown Phantom.
</p><br><p>Outwardly, they didn’t look any stronger than the Green Threat Monsters.
</p><br><p>Damn, Adam had seen more threatening monsters at the lowest level. When it still mattered, he and Silvana occasionally browsed through the bestiary provided by the mission department.
</p><br><p>But their calm, intense auras immediately showed that no Red Threat monster was a challenge to them. At least the ones from the New Wave.
</p><br><p>Adam gulped as he began to gather energy in his chest.
</p><br><p>He had managed to escape from the stone flower, but now he had two beasts to fight at once.
</p><br><p>"Well, at least this one is two identical opponents, and it’s unlikely they have any special attacks."
</p><br><p>With white particles, a second needle was ready to appear in Adam’s hand as a chill ran through his body.
</p><br><p>A shadow fell over him, causing him to turn around to see towering over him the stone flower. It took some time to climb the steep wall, but unlike Adam who only had four limbs, the stone flower had over ten strong vines.
</p><br><p>’We must use the trump card! Adam, I’m ready!’ Silvana promptly said.
</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could respond, two shadows swept to his left and right. The gray beasts pounced on the stone flower, their powerful jaws closing around the vines, effortlessly chewing through the strong protective layer.
</p><br><p>The stone flower wanted to attack Adam to finish what it started, but the gray beasts already dragged it down.
</p><br><p>With a rumble, the three monsters collapsed to the ground at the bottom of the gorge.
</p><br><p>Several vines tried to cling to the wall to reach Adam, but the gray beasts wouldn’t let that happen. With bestial ferocity and teamwork, the gray beasts pulled the stone flower by the vines, gradually tearing them away from the plant’s massive body.
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes went wide for a moment, to see how hard it was for the stone flower to resist the two beasts.
</p><br><p>The gray beasts couldn’t win quickly, though. They acted cautiously.
</p><br><p>"I don’t know what made them attack that flower, but I’m not interested, to be honest." Adam shook his head, turning around.
</p><br><p>There were many bones protruding out amongst the dark earth. Some were massive and old and already turned to stone, while others were white and even had drops of blood on them.
</p><br><p>Before Adam’s arrival, the gray beasts were ripping meat off a large bone protruding from the surface. This bone belonged to a monster much stronger than them.
</p><br><p>Then, Adam’s corner of his eye noticed a bright, calm light in the distance.
</p><br><p>’Good, I need to find a safe place, even if for a short period.’</p>
