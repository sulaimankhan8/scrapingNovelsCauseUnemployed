            <br><p>As soon as the Inferno Serpent appeared, Risha found herself in a difficult situation. This opponent was not her level, she knew that, but she still couldn't notice how the red threads twisted her arm.</p><br><p>She didn't know where the conversation between the Inferno Serpent and Adam would lead, but it caused the threads to slip, freeing her clenched arm.</p><br><p>Then, several spiders appeared beside Adam, about to cast the threads over him like a net and tear him apart with their powerful jaws.</p><br><p>Everything was happening fast, but not so fast that a K3-Phantom such as Risha didn't have time to react.</p><br><br><p>She gripped the Revelation Ring tightly, summoning her Nexus.</p><br><p>But... before she could even take a single step forward-</p><br><br><p>The massive tail slammed into her like a whip throwing her aside. Despite the rumble, Risha quickly jumped out of the dust cloud going to help Adam no matter what.</p><br><p>Then, the Inferno Serpent's gaze fell upon her, causing her to freeze in place.</p><br><p>"You want to help your friend? How commendable..."</p><br><p>Risha frowned, swinging her axe. "He's not my friend! But... I'm not going to stand by and watch monsters attack my partner in front of my fucking eyes!"</p><br><p>A slight smirk showed on the Inferno Serpent before quickly disappearing.</p><br><p>"Heh... Admirable," he nodded. "However, if you take another step, I'll have to deal with you..."</p><br><br><p>The tip of his tail ended up at her neck. Too big to pierce her throat, but massive enough to leave no trace of her head.</p><br><p>"Let me explain something to you. I can tell from your aura. You are too weak to give me a decent fight or fit for my other assignment..."</p><br><p>At the last words, the Inferno Serpent stammered, as if he wasn't sure if he should go that far.</p><br><p>"But, the aura of this young man... Adam Vinter... It is different from yours. You're on the same level, and at the same time, you're too different. I have to find out what's going on."</p><br><p>A flurry of red threads swept in front of Adam's blue eyes, aiming for his neck.</p><br><br><p>His hand, full of energy, grabbed the threads in a wisp, clutching tightly and pressing down. Before the spiders' jaws could touch him, their bodies slammed into the ground, moving to follow the threads.</p><br><p>Adam already knew who his opponents were. Silvana had informed him of the Red Flame Spiders, the Two Star Red Threat Monsters.</p><br><p>They were no stronger than the obsidian lizards, but Adam was more serious than before.</p><br><p>He was annoyed that his weapon was being used against him.</p><br><p>Then, several of the spiders bounced back, digging their legs into the solid rock. Their backs shuddered, launching blasts of flame at Adam, burning the air like meteorites in their path.</p><br><p>However, Adam didn't even think of dodging. Instead, with a grim face, he shook his head.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" The Inferno Serpent was stumped. "Human... No, Adam Vinter... You don't seem to be impressed with my subordinates' charge at all."</p><br><p>"No, that's not it," Adam scratched the back of his head, remaining in place despite the flaming blasts. "I'm just disgusted that you decided to use threads against me."</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent was left even more confused. He had fought against many Phantoms in his long life, but this was the first time he faced such a complaint.</p><br><p>But, he soon received the answer to his question.</p><br><p>With a bright flash, a black coat covered Adam's body, three sharp silver threads emanating from each of his hands, causing the Inferno Serpent's pupils to narrow in shock.</p><br><p>Then, two amber eyes, as if the same as the old serpent's, opened wide under Adam's collar.</p><br><p>Three short ripples spread out in all directions, turning everything in their path into cold, soulless stone.</p><br><p>The flaming blobs collapsed to the ground, shattering into shards, all the red spiders turned into motionless statues unable to resist Adam's influence.</p><br><p>However, this unique ability, although it was Adam's trump card, was not omnipotent. The effects of petrification varied from opponent to opponent.</p><br><br><p>A thin, almost imperceptible layer of stone covered the scales on the Inferno Serpent's head. But, in the next burst of the monster's aura, they broke into fragments.</p><br><p>"What the...?" Adam gulped in disbelief.</p><br><p>He didn't expect to turn S4 into stone with Moira's ability, especially one so large, but he didn't understand how he'd achieved little to no effect.</p><br><p>Risha gasped. Envy and awe at Adam's ability reflected in her eyes.</p><br><p>'Wow... That was awesome.'</p><br><p>Unfortunately, Adam did not share her elation.</p><br><p>'I couldn't stop it even for a second... No, I didn't even manage to slow it down. Are S4 monsters really that strong?</p><br><br><p>A massive tail came crashing down on him in the shadows, Adam bounced to the side, defending himself with his coat from the debris.</p><br><p>'The Prime Obsidian Lizard...' he pondered. 'It was an S3 monster. I killed it in one punch using nothing but Energy Control and my Elemental Root. But... My trump card did not affect the Inferno Serpent?'</p><br><p>No, it couldn't be true.</p><br><p>The difference in strength between the S3 and S4 monster should be, Adam was well aware of that. However, he had a feeling that the Prime Obsidian Lizard was a Yellow Threat monster compared to the Inferno Serpent.</p><br><p>'No...' Adam internally shook his head. 'The Inferno Serpent is stronger, but that's not the point. He probably has a high resistance to petrification or many attributes in general.'</p><br><p>With determination in his gaze, Adam channeled the energy to his feet, making a high-speed leap forward.</p><br><p>Risha's eyes twitched to the left, struggling to keep up with his lightning-fast movements.</p><br><p>Bouncing off the edge of the lake, Adam found himself facing the massive body of the Inferno Serpent, while purple streams ran along his right arm.</p><br><p>'Surely one blow will be enough to shatter his scales into dust!'</p><br><br><p>His fist slammed into a solid layer of and... only one scale cracked. A shudder went through the plates, reducing Adam's impact to zero.</p><br><p>"Hahaha... Nice try young man..."</p><br><p>Under a mocking laugh, the Inferno Serpent turned around as his tail slammed into Adam's stomach like a steel club.</p><br><p>As a result, Adam flew hundreds of meters forward, whizzing between dozens of stone peaks in the shadows.</p>
