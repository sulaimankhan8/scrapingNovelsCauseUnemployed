            <br><p>At first, Adam's eyes tried to follow Max's movements, but after only a few seconds, his eyes saw the ceiling before approaching the floor in a pool of blood.</p><br><p>Because this was a virtual space, Adam could see everything even though he was dead.</p><br><p>He could see what the aftermath of Max's attack was, how fast and strong he was.</p><br><p>And... that was only part of the brutality that a man so powerful was capable of.</p><br><p>Smiling bitterly, Adam closed his eyes having control of the head that was a few meters away from his body.</p><br><p>Then, his silhouette trembled, along with the blood turning into light particles before disappearing completely.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Max's real body came into motion as he removed his helmet and for the first time in hours was able to move for real instead of being a digital copy.</p><br><p>Silvana gulped as she turned to Dahla, she realized that her question made sense since she was now completely sure of it.</p><br><br><p>Dahla slowly looked at Silvana as she raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"Hmm? What are you talking about?"</p><br><p>Silvana uttered with wide eyes:</p><br><p>"Why hasn't he become a Phantom yet? It may be an impossible task for most people, but not for him."</p><br><p>Silvana waved her hand:</p><br><p>"If you give him the most powerful weapon created without using genes, something with plasma, some kind of drug that will make him even stronger for a short time, he will definitely win. If it's a 1 on 1 fight, his chances of winning will be 100%, there's no single chance he'll lose!"</p><br><p>Dahla did not immediately reply.</p><br><p>Instead, she turned her head and looked at Max, who was disconnecting the sensors from his body at that time.</p><br><p>Then, Dahla nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Everything you said is true. If you give him a powerful non-gene weapon and a military amplifier, most White Threat monsters won't be able to do anything to him. Max will just wipe out his enemies."</p><br><p>Silvana wanted to say something but when she glanced at Riska, she realized that Max might have a reason to stay where he was.</p><br><p>"Agh... I see... He doesn't want to become a Phantom."</p><br><p>Silvana decided that Max's situation was the same as Riska's and Narata's, that of Phantoms who didn't choose to live such a life.</p><br><p>But... she left out a few important points when coming to that conclusion.</p><br><p>"No, you're wrong." Dahla said sternly, "Unlike Riska, and others like her, Max knows and loves to fight, bloody battles are his second home. And, he has nothing against becoming the Natural Phantom."</p><br><p>Silvana tilted her head, she was completely baffled.</p><br><p>"Then why hasn't he done it yet? I'm sure the Dark Order would have no problem preparing a special mission for him, giving him a weapon and choosing a monster."</p><br><p>Dahla took a deep breath as if Silvana was saying something stupid. It was unusual for Silvana to find herself in such a position, she was usually the one who let out such sighs.</p><br><p>"Because he's a grown man who has his responsibilities, especially to his niece."</p><br><p>"Niece?" Silvana asked, slightly surprised.</p><br><br><p>"Lona is an ordinary human and she is studying at an institute to become an actor. When she was 11 years old she lost both her parents in a car accident, out of her relatives she only had Max. However, for Max, she is also the only relative."</p><br><br><p>"Max won't go to the Dead Lands to kill his first monster until Lona finishes her degree. He's confident in his abilities, but realizes that every Phantom has a chance at sudden death."</p><br><p>Then, Dahla's gaze grew heavier, filled with sadness and regret that Max and Lona were in such a situation.</p><br><p>"He doesn't want to take any chances, even if the chances of tragedy are low, he doesn't want her to be left without support until she graduates."</p><br><br><p>"Obviously, Max makes good money from his position, especially for an ordinary person. So when Lona gets her profession a new phase in his life will begin."</p><br><p>Silvana blinked a few times.</p><br><p>"And...? How many years does Lona still have left to study? When will she have her final exam?"</p><br><p>Dahla glanced at Silvana as a sly smile appeared on her face.</p><br><p>"Pretty soon. It's almost summer, the final exam will be in early August."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide as she realized something.</p><br><p>"Wait... The beginning of August...? Doesn't that coincide with the end of Adam's training?"</p><br><br><p>"Exactly. This August will be rich in various events. Max will finally breathe a sigh of relief when Lona gets a profession, Adam's training will end, and most importantly..."</p><br><p>Dahla looked intently at Adam who like Max was getting out of his chair.</p><br><p>Read latest stories on empire</p><br><p>"Then there will also be the wedding between Osana De Rouzet and Nirosh Marzo."</p><br><p>"And The Rule of Power..." Silvana muttered with a slight concern in her voice.</p><br><p>With a brief pause, Dahla replied shortly in a low voice: "Yeah. I doubted this venture at first, but I have to admit that Adam has a chance of winning."</p><br><p>Silvana smirked as she arrogantly lifted her chin looking at Dahla from top to bottom. Silvana knew her secret so she felt an advantage in this conversation.</p><br><p>"You realized that after he managed to fight you back? You looked like a student being scolded by the teacher."</p><br><p>Dahla frowned heavily as she glared menacingly at Silvana.</p><br><p>"Watch your language. We may be on the same side and doing the same thing right now, but you're still just an Operator. You have a K4-Phantom in front of you, for fuck's sake!"</p><br><p>The formidable voice of the strong Phantom made Silvana come to her senses. She gulped and nodded guiltily. She understood that her behavior was inappropriate for their statuses.</p><br><p>"But..." Dahla uttered looking at Adam and Max who approached each other and exchanged a handshake, "What he did showed his attitude and character. Furthermore, I think his first day of training was remarkably successful."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide as she looked at Dahla in disbelief.</p><br><p>"What? I'm glad to hear that, but didn't Adam just keep losing?"</p><br><p>Dahla rested her cheek on her hand, looking at Tron.</p><br><p>"Well... If you knew more about his training plan, you'd know what I'm talking about."</p>
