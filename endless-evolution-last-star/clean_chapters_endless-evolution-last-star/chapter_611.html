            <br><p>As was well known, the Moon Colosseum was a special arena not only because of its size and the importance of the fights held there but also because of its essence, the one rare and unique External Artifact lurking deep beneath the arena.</p><br><p>This artifact was responsible for a barrier capable of absorbing even the most powerful attacks to keep the spectators safe and... protection was not all that the Moon Colosseum was capable of.</p><br><br><p>Hundreds of speedy blue sparks flew upward from the barrier, not aggressive electrical discharges, but calm, attractive flashes that for a moment hung in the air like a million dormant stars.</p><br><p>Soon, the stars merged into a single beam, quickly approaching their target. Whether the target tried to escape or dodge, it was impossible as every seat in the audience was at the complete mercy of the Moon Colosseum.</p><br><p>Nirosh looked up sharply, he realized that the blue beam was heading towards him.</p><br><p>"Wait! I'm not ready! I don't have to fight!"</p><br><p>But... hardly the Moon Colosseum was interested in his opinion. The decision was made, and soon there would be another fight in the arena.</p><br><p>In a blink of an eye, Nirosh found himself against the wall, opposite Adam and even further away from Fromund who was sleeping peacefully in the farthest part of the arena.</p><br><p>"Hey... I don't have a weapon! How am I supposed to fight against him?!" Nirosh exclaimed addressing the crowd.</p><br><p>This was his last chance to escape from the cage the artifact had forcibly moved him to.</p><br><p>And, he might succeed, some of the nobles' faces reflected doubt. Whispers spread through the audience seats like wildfire.</p><br><br><p>A clear click sounded from the side of Kogen's box, the nearest people turned around to see Gladius with a devilish smirk on his face, his eyes narrowed and slightly curved like infernal blades.</p><br><p>"Hehehehe, how good it is to know the secrets only available to the strongest. It opens up so many possibilities."</p><br><p>Silvana like everyone else watched Gladius, waiting for what would happen next, for the moment she shifted her gaze to Kogen and Erik, who remained calm.</p><br><p>'Wait... At what point did they know it was going to happen this way? Fuck, the difference between us scares me.'</p><br><p>A few seconds later, under the light of the morning sun, some object flew by throwing a wide shadow from its wings onto the arena.</p><br><p>In the feet of the raven with strange, creepy pupils, was a long black case and it was clearly not for some businessman's documents, but a weapon made for fighting against monsters.</p><br><br><p>As soon as the raven released its grip, the black case collapsed to the ground, just a few meters away from Nirosh.</p><br><p>Then, the raven vanished without a trace.</p><br><br><p>Kogen slammed on the handle of his throne, staring intently at Nirosh.</p><br><p>"What do you say now? You have a weapon, your opponent is badly wounded and exhausted and you're on the same level."</p><br><p>With a vicious smirk, Kogen leaned forward, his predatory gaze piercing through Nirosh.</p><br><p>"I think something else is more important, though. Would a high noble like you be afraid of a young man who less than a year ago was living in the slums and was a commoner? Hahaha, how funny and pathetic is that?! It's just pathetic!"</p><br><p>Whereas Gladius used his words and tone as a weapon to get the audience in the mood he wanted, Kogen simply said what he thought, and how he felt.</p><br><p>And, quite often, this approach was much more effective because of its sincerity.</p><br><p>The eyes of the viewers glowed, and they nodded approvingly, since if Adam decided to fight in such a state, it was his choice.</p><br><p>Realizing that he had no other choice, Nirosh clenched his fists tightly and cursed:</p><br><p>"Fuck it! I'll show you what I can do! You're just an idiot, you suicidal bastard! Under equal conditions, I would beat you in less than a minute, and now... you won't even last ten seconds against me!"</p><br><p>With a fiery exclamation, Nirosh opened his case, pulling out a one-handed saber with a sharp, curved tip.</p><br><p>The saber's handle was long and thick, a circular guard covering part of Nirosh's hand and blue metallic straight lines running down the broad blade.</p><br><p>Adam's gaze grew deeper, darker.</p><br><p>"Oh, when you had no other option left, you decided to act cool and confident?"</p><br><p>Nirosh bit his lip, he realized that his performance didn't seem convincing, but... what else was he supposed to do?</p><br><p>Adam gave a deep deep nod.</p><br><p>"Well, that's good, because..."</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>At the same moment, his grip grew stronger, the veins on his body swelled and his only remaining eye filled with blood.</p><br><p>Silvana gasped, covering her mouth with her palm.</p><br><p>'How long ago was it...? During the battle against the Plague Reaper, I believe... Resonance, Adam wasn't capable of entering that state during training, but... it didn't even happen against Fromund, not with one of them.'</p><br><br><p>Hot steam came out at Adam's sigh, his teeth grinding like iron plates and his gaze wanting to burn Nirosh, to turn him into a handful of pitiful ashes.</p><br><p>"Because I'm fucking beyond mad. You have no idea how badly I want to tear you into pieces!"</p><br><br><p>Without waiting for a response, Adam stepped forward, shaking the ground with his powerful, heavy giant-like stomp. A clot of dark blood fell down from the wounds on his body, but... it didn't bother him.</p><br><p>Nirosh's expression became more serious.</p><br><p>'Shit... I have to act.'</p><br><p>Then, his eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>"I will show you my power! I'll destroy you with all my power so that you'll never think of comparing me to a piece of shit like you again!"</p><br><p>Blue flames covered his sword, and azure glow thickly enveloped his legs and arms, making him stronger and his energy was not going to calm down. Nirosh intended to use most of his abilities at once since his enemy was already at the limit.</p><br><br><p>The crimson energy covering Adam shuddered as his silhouette blurred, disappearing into a menacing shadow.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam appeared right in front of Nirosh, his pupils narrowed filling with animal fear.</p><br><br><p>The broad blade of the ghastly sword, leaving a dark red trail behind it, swept through the air to slash into vulnerable flesh.</p><br><br><p>A fountain of blood gushed from Nirosh's arm as his severed arm below the elbow flew aside along with his saber.</p><br><p>Before the pain could fill every part of Nirosh's body, Adam's palm landed on his face, smashing his head into the wall with a loud crack, either from bones or broken rocks.</p><br><p>"What did you say back there about Fromund's little sisters?"</p><br><p>Adam's voice like a demon's whisper reached Nirosh's ears, then Adam leaned forward, his face half covered by his helmet was right in front of Nirosh's pale, contorted from pain.</p><br><br><p>His fingers clenched tighter, digging into Nirosh's flesh like sharp blades using his brute force.</p><br><p>"I have a younger sister too and... it was a big mistake to threaten him like that before me..."</p><br><br><p>Adam's knee plunged into Nirosh's stomach, a thick surge of blood flew out of his mouth bringing another wave of pain.</p><br><p>"So prepare yourself, as you will not leave this arena... at least not while you are alive..."</p>
