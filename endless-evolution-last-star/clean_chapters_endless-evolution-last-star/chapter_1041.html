            <h4>Chapter 1041: Invitation on fight (Part 2)</h4><br><p>Due to Adam’s careless initiative, Risha, Vorx, and Heret were left with the three of them against the Blood Crushers and the pack of the Voracious Beast.
</p><br><p>Well, only one of them was annoyed by Adam’s decision.
</p><br><p>"Shit! That’s not the way to do it! We came here together, we’re supposed to fight together as a solid group!" Heret clenched his fists, shaking his head disapprovingly.
</p><br><br><p>Vorx’s hand fell on his shoulder, clapping several times.
</p><br><p>"Hahaha! You’re too glum! It’s not that bad! We’re still in the majority! Three against two and a pack of scared dogs!"
</p><br><p>"Tsk. These are dangerous monsters. What happens if we get hurt or worse...!"
</p><br><p>It was possible to understand Heret. Over the past few months he was used to thinking not as a warrior, much less a monster, but as a leader who was obliged to follow plans and find the most efficient and safest ways for himself and his men.
</p><br><p>It was time for him to remember what it was like to be a monster. It was a good feeling at times, even too much so.
</p><br><p>"Well, that’s the point, my dear friend!" Vorx clapped him on the back to warm him up.
</p><br><br><p>Bright flames ran down Vorx’s arms as he headed to the right of the Blood Crusher.
</p><br><p>"To get stronger, you must defeat strong opponents. If you don’t, you’ll be stuck at the same level forever. You forget what it’s like to win by staying in a pool of your own blood!"
</p><br><p>He slammed his fists against each other, fiery sparks flying apart.
</p><br><p>"Adam’s a smart guy. He gave you a chance to remember the taste of a bloody and long battle! We must not miss it!"
</p><br><p>Heret answered nothing. His eyes ran from side to side, glancing back and forth at Risha and then at Vorx.
</p><br><p>For a moment, he remembered his battle against Arnoth. Unfortunately, Heret could do almost nothing in the face of such a crushing foe.
</p><br><p>That wasn’t the problem.
</p><br><p>’Damn it. They’re right, they’re both right. I was prepared for defeat against Arnoth, but... I lost too quickly! I should have helped Adam at least a little!’
</p><br><p>With determination in his gaze, Heret stood next to Vorx. Risha was already ready to fight, provoking the Voracious Beasts.
</p><br><p>They and the Blood Crushers were ready to rush into battle.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, a bright flash illuminated the blood pond.
</p><br><p>All eyes went to one point - to Adam and the unknown figure standing opposite him in a long red cloak.
</p><br><p>For a few seconds, the white thread connecting them was motionless. Soon, two gentle, feminine hands removed the hood.
</p><br><p>Then, a terrifying scream, like a banshee’s howl, echoed across the blood pond. The scream was loud enough to make Risha, Heret, Vorx, and all the other monsters collapse to their knees.
</p><br><p>Risha, Heret, and Vorx were strong enough to withstand the force of the howl, but the Blood Hunters and the Blood Reapers just weren’t that strong. The waves of sound tore their bodies apart, flooding the caverns with rivers of dark blood.
</p><br><br><p>The Blood Crushers collapsed to their knees, holding the ground with their fists to keep from falling completely.
</p><br><p>No one understood what was happening.
</p><br><p>But, it was obvious to everyone - the monster in front of Adam was the strongest at the blood pond and the only one who could be an opponent in his situation.
</p><br><br><br><p>A spark flew out of Adam’s chest, heading towards the maiden - connecting the two of them with a white thread of energy.
</p><br><p>Adam blinked, bemused. He didn’t think this would happen. Then, he noticed a bloody speck of energy at the maiden’s chest, hiding under her wide cloak.
</p><br><p>Oddly enough, the maiden stopped even though she was about to leave. She didn’t see Adam as a worthy opponent, which wasn’t surprising since he wasn’t showing his true aura at full power.
</p><br><p>"You..." her unpleasant, squeaky voice rang out from the shadows of her hood. "You challenged me?"
</p><br><p>"Agh?" Adam scratched the back of his head. "You know how to talk? Good, but I still don’t know what you’re referring to. I was just drawn to you. You’re the only one here who made my Evolution Tree shiver."
</p><br><p>She flashed a scornful glare at him, her crimson eyes like bloody rubies shining out of the darkness.
</p><br><p>"You are at the edge of evolution... You ignorant brat! It’s only natural that you should find someone on a similar level. Someone to whom you are willing to offer your power as a reward for victory!"
</p><br><p>Adam was silent for a while. He looked at the thread, and at the particle of the maiden’s energy, the same spark was ready to head toward Adam. All that was needed was the maiden’s permission.
</p><br><p>For a split second, Adam closed his eyes, touching the ghostly silhouette of his Third Key.
</p><br><p>The last, second condition became clear to him, causing him to smile slightly.
</p><br><p>"Oh, I see... Now everything is falling into place. So, if you defeat you will take my energy and spark. If I defeat you, I get the same. In short, the winner gets a straight ticket to the next stage of evolution, right?"
</p><br><p>The maiden nodded slightly but was in no hurry to accept Adam’s invitation to fight.
</p><br><p>"Yes, that’s how it works most of the time. It’s not much different than a normal battle, but our energy helps us find worthy opponents."
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes filled with meaning. All that mattered was energy. If the creature was close enough to evolution, a massive amount of energy was capable of breaking all limits.
</p><br><p>"But... you..." she hissed. "You’re weak! Your aura is weak! You don’t even have one arm! Go away and don’t you dare insult me with your offer to fight!"
</p><br><p>Adam had no intention of taking his spark.
</p><br><p>It was evident from the look in his eyes.
</p><br><p>Now, the maiden had only two choices - either force him to give up the fight or let out her key spark.
</p><br><p>"Tsk. I’ll show you how wrong you are!"
</p><br><p>She threw off her hood, revealing her pale, delicate face like a young girl’s.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, dark blood in streams ran down her arms and legs, revealing dozens of ghastly jaws that were part of her body.
</p><br><p>A horrifying scream spread across the blood pond - the first to reach Adam.
</p><br><p>But, he just grinned as his frame shuddered.
</p><br><p>A moment later, his hand fell on the maiden’s face, wrenching her from her seat.
</p><br><p>"Good, in that case, I’ll either make you take the fight or eat you. It wouldn’t be the first time I’ve done that."</p>
