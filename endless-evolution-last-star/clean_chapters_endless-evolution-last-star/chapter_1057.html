            <h4>Chapter 1057: Falling Chains (Part 1)</h4><br><p>Gladius, in a hurry to not only help Adam but not miss out on the fun, was trying to get to the Dark Shore as fast as he could.
</p><br><p>He didn’t have the time to use the method that high-level Phantoms like him used. It required some preparations that he didn’t want to waste time on.
</p><br><p>So, all he had was his legs, energy, and physical might.
</p><br><p>Despite his great speed, getting from the Citadel to the Dark Shore on foot was not an easy task. It required quite a bit of time.
</p><br><p>’What do you think? Is that guy still alive?" Gladius asked.
</p><br><p>Xyrea raised an eyebrow. ’Gladius, I have no idea. I don’t have access to his NEP, it just doesn’t work. But, his Operator hasn’t sent any requests for help or reported the death of her Phantom.’
</p><br><p>That was enough to put a sly smirk on Gladius’s face.
</p><br><p>’That’s more than enough. This guy’s tough.’
</p><br><p>’Well... You’re more worried about running out of time, right? After all, if he finds the Twilight Crystal faster than you arrive, you’ll miss all the fun.’ Xyrea said with a calm face, though she hit it right on the mark.
</p><br><p>Gladius’s eyes went wide as he realized that this could have happened, though he tried to shrug off those thoughts.
</p><br><p>’No! There’s no way it can happen that fast! I have to come at just the right moment... I have to take the best part!’
</p><br><p>Xyrea answered nothing. She only licked her lips with her long, inhuman tongue.
</p><br><p>She didn’t know if Gladius would be able to be the center of attention this time or not, but she would watch.
</p><br><p>Unlike him, she would enjoy the show either way.
</p><br><p>See Gladius in excitement or anger?
</p><br><p>She was fine with both.
</p><br><br><br><p>At the same time, Osmer, Rosana, and a few other followers of the Sacrificial Waterfalls were heading toward the western waterfall to get a view of the Sorrowful Dew Expanse.
</p><br><p>Osmer knew that Adam was there, but events could change quickly.
</p><br><p>"Elder Osmer... Do you think Adam could still be alive?" Rosana asked, puzzled.
</p><br><p>"Yes." Osmer gave a dry answer. "I know what you’re thinking... Kenward, Rider of Darkness. He watches over the dew trees and is ready to kill anyone who disturbs the trees. That’s true, but... if Adam came to the Dark Shore with a dark aura, then he was brought here by the First Star."
</p><br><p>For a moment, Rosana stopped as her expression froze.
</p><br><p>Unlike Adam, who had only recently learned these secrets directly from Kenward, for Rosana, it had become well-known some time ago.
</p><br><p>Monsters with name and mind were originally above other monsters. They learned the secrets of this world a bit faster than the Phantoms, among whom there were no significant differences like it was between monsters.
</p><br><p>The fact that the monster had a name was many times more important than the fact that the Phantom was a Natural One rather than an Artificial One. As time passed, Phantom’s origin became less and less important, and the monster’s name only empowered it, allowing it to achieve a higher status and even possibly gain a title.
</p><br><p>"B-But... He’s a Phantom!" Rosana exclaimed in a trembling voice. "What does he have to do with the First Star?!"
</p><br><p>Osmer shook his head. "The First Star has a connection to everything, just... monsters take its perspective, unlike humans. That’s why you, I, and everyone at the Sacrificial Waterfalls are loyal to the Befallen Crown."
</p><br><p>After a moment, Rosana nodded deeply.
</p><br><p>"But, Kenward is not one of us. He, like all followers of the Free End, put the desires of the First Star above all else."
</p><br><p>"True," Osmer confirmed. "But, we too follow a primary goal, it’s just that we think far ahead. To achieve a great goal, a needed future for our world, sometimes the wishes of the First Star can be ignored. Moreover, they are merely nameless shards, lacking a tiny fraction of its greatness."
</p><br><p>Rosana said nothing more as she continued to follow Osmer among the twisting roots and dark paths, to the sound of many waterfalls.
</p><br><p>Rosana had thoughts that she dared not voice in front of Osmer.
</p><br><p>’Shit, if we think ahead and the Free End followers don’t, then why are there only true monsters among them? Why are they so strong...? Their power... It’s terrifying.’
</p><br><p>Neither Rosana nor Osmer were going to fight against Kenward under any circumstances. They simply didn’t stand a chance against him.
</p><br><p>It was like the K3-Phantom going up against the Second Rank Phantom in mortal combat, fighting at all costs.
</p><br><p>After a few minutes, their group stopped at the top of the waterfall getting a view of the vast lands of the Sorrowful Dew Expanse.
</p><br><p>Amidst the soot and bone-covered land, a few white dots - the dew trees - stretched for many kilometers. From this distance, they looked no bigger than grains of rice.
</p><br><p>However, they had no trouble determining where Kenward was. Even though his frame was covered in black clothes and his horse was covered in darkness, his menacing aura caught their eyes immediately.
</p><br><br><p>Instinctively, most of their group took a step back with trembling legs. Rosana was among them.
</p><br><p>She gulped, trying to discern the young man who sat behind Kenward.
</p><br><p>"Rosana..." Osmer wheezed. "That’s him, right? That young man, that’s Adam?"
</p><br><br><p>"There is no doubt about it, elder. With difficulty, but through Kenward’s field, I can feel his aura. And, his eyes... I will not forget them, at least not as long as he is alive!"
</p><br><p>One of the group, a tall man with thick crimson hair, approached Osmer. He was one of the few who could withstand the pressure from Kenward’s aura.
</p><br><p>Unlike Osmer’s frail body, he was full of trembling muscles, and his gaze was as ferocious as a proud lion’s.
</p><br><p>"What shall we do, Osmer?" He asked in a low voice.
</p><br><p>Osmer sighed heavily.
</p><br><p>"Just observe for now, not that we have any other choice... From the looks of it, they’re heading to the chains. We have no power there."</p>
