            <h4>Chapter 1447: Permission</h4><br><p>This wasn’t the first time Adam needed rest after a tough battle. How much time he needed to rest depended on how much energy he had expended and how badly he had been wounded.
</p><br><p>Sure, it would have been a better decision to use the healing pods in the medical ward on the spire, but Adam didn’t even think about it. He just fell asleep.
</p><br><p>However, at this level, even the most advanced technology was not capable of fully restoring him in a few hours, as it would have worked with a K0-Phantom, for example.
</p><br><p>Adam had enormous reserves of energy, and it would take time to replenish them, or... help from both inside and outside.
</p><br><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.
</p><br><p>There was a knock on the door, light and calm.
</p><br><p>KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!
</p><br><p>The patience quickly ran out as the knock was now like a hammer hitting the door with full force.
</p><br><p>With a great frown, Silvana opened her eyes.
</p><br><p>She hadn’t had such a good sleep in a long time, and someone decided to interrupt it!
</p><br><p>"Tsk, what the hell...?" Silvana threw the pillow aside and headed straight for the door.
</p><br><p>A dull sound echoed from her bare footsteps as she touched the door handle.
</p><br><p>She didn’t know what to expect on the other side, maybe it was a neighbor, a courier, or someone from the government. Silvana didn’t know, she just wanted to deal with it and get back to bed.
</p><br><br><p>The door opened, and there was nothing behind it, only darkness in which the Silver Weaver stood.
</p><br><p>"Hi, can I come in?" He asked, unable to cross the threshold without her permission.
</p><br><p>Silvana’s eyes widened in confusion. It took her a few seconds to realize what was happening.
</p><br><br><br><br><p>A cup of coffee appeared in front of the Silver Weaver as Silvana sat down opposite him.
</p><br><p>"So, we’re not in the real world right now, but in Adam’s inner space?" she asked, uncertainly.
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver waved his hand carelessly.
</p><br><p>"Something like that. We’re even a little deeper in your space, so you’re still asleep, technically. Your apartment is what your mind created, so you wouldn’t be left in the dark when I disturbed you."
</p><br><br><p>This had never happened before, but she understood that there was nothing incredible about it. She had long since learned to navigate Adam’s inner space. But, previously, neither the Evolution Tree nor Lone Blaze had ever tried to contact her, especially while she was asleep.
</p><br><p>"Since you came to me, you must have some business, right?"
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver took a sip of coffee. "Sure, I want to use you."
</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Silvana was caught off guard. "Y-You want w-what?!"
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver chuckled as he threw two sugar cubes into his overly bitter coffee.
</p><br><p>"Don’t be embarrassed. Even if I wanted to, I couldn’t touch you, though... Hah, I know everything Adam does, so..."
</p><br><p>"Shut up!" Silvana exclaimed, her face as red as a tomato.
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver chuckled:
</p><br><p>"Hahaha, alright, I won’t joke anymore. What I want from you is your permission."
</p><br><p>Silvana tilted her head. "Hmm? My permission?"
</p><br><p>"Yep, just like you allowed me to enter your space, I want to use your energy to help Adam recover faster."
</p><br><p>Silvana said nothing. She didn’t yet understand what the Silver Weaver’s plan was.
</p><br><p>"You see, considering what Adam has been through lately, namely four consecutive fights: the fight against Beatra in the arena, then against Anelez and Erada, and finally the most difficult duel against Menax, he needs rest, a very long one."
</p><br><p>She nodded, she knew this well. Even before the Silver Weaver appeared, she had waited many times for Adam’s return after fights, from a few days to weeks.
</p><br><p>"I may be wrong, but according to my calculations, it will now take him a month to wake up and then another month to return to his peak powers."
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Silvana’s face paled as she realized how long that was.
</p><br><p>"W-Wait, why so long?! Are you sure about that?"
</p><br><p>In response, the Silver Weaver nodded. He wasn’t as obedient and efficient as Lone Blaze, but he certainly wouldn’t lie in such a situation.
</p><br><p>"Damn... That’s a really long time. But, it seems like you have a plan, don’t you?"
</p><br><p>"Of course. You see, you both have sources of energy. Adam has much more energy than you, but that’s why you recover your reserves much faster. You didn’t realize it, but she fell asleep right after Adam because you were exhausted as well."
</p><br><p>Silvana gasped for a moment as she realized that the Silver Weaver was right. In order for Adam to use his Nexus, she had to give him all the energy she had. Without that, Adam wouldn’t have been able to make his last few attacks and would have surely lost.
</p><br><p>"So, let’s say I don’t mind what you want to do with my energy?"
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver waved his hand. "Nothing special. I’m already directing energy flows to help Adam recover faster, but with your help, I’ll use your energy as well, directing it straight into the Evolution Tree through the Energy Axis."
</p><br><p>Silvana understood how it worked. The Silver Weaver would not create new energy. He just wanted to use what they had as efficiently as possible.
</p><br><p>"It can’t be that simple, right?" She looked up. "What will I have to sacrifice for this? What kind of restrictions are we talking about?"
</p><br><p>"Hah, take it easy. I’m not asking you to sell your soul, just to give me temporary control over your energy. But, you’re right, there is one drawback. You’ll be in the same exhausted state as Adam, so... in short, you’ll wake up at the same time, when you both have recovered enough energy."
</p><br><br><p>She sighed with relief.
</p><br><p>Everything turned out much better than Silvana had thought.
</p><br><p>"And? If I give you my energy, how long will we have to be asleep?"
</p><br><p>"Ten days to two weeks. I think it’s a great offer considering that I’ll be doing all the work." The Silver Weaver rolled his eyes.
</p><br><p>Silvana smiled. "Yeah... That’s true. I agree. I give you my permission."
</p><br><p>"Good." He stood up in front of Silvana. "Then I’ll see you in ten days."
</p><br><br><br><p>The Silver Weaver touched Silvana’s forehead.
</p><br><p>He disappeared as darkness engulfed her, plunging her back into sleep.</p>
