            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1386: Victory Tea Party</strong></p><br><p>While Norax and the Black Cut members were enjoying their rewards from the Silver Beacon, and Misty was heading towards the artifact, Adam was speeding straight towards the Silver Beacon.</p><br><p>Just like the first time, Bertrada used her teleportation ability to move Adam from the island at the Forgotten Mills.</p><br><p>It only took a few seconds, and he was ready for it, but despite the speed of his star, he couldn’t help but notice the bright light in the distance.</p><br><p>“So that’s what Norax was talking about, right?” Adam thought, glancing down.</p><br><p>It was a brief glimpse, during which it was impossible to see everything in detail, but Adam understood the general picture.</p><br><p>He closed his eyes, and in the next moment, the shaking stopped.</p><br><p>He found himself not outside the barrier as before, but next to the elevator that had previously sent him to the island.</p><br><p>Adam looked around, seeing the endless white void as well as the path leading to the gate.</p><br><p>This time, something was different.</p><br><p>“Looks like she’s really busy.” Adam smiled as he looked at the place where Mona had met him. “That’s good. It means my decision to agree to his plan wasn’t a mistake.”</p><br><br><p>Silvana appeared next to him, touching his shoulder encouragingly.</p><br><p>“You did the right thing, and… it’s kind of weird.”</p><br><p>“Hmm? What are you talking about?”</p><br><p>“Well,” Silvana glanced toward the island. “Mona is several dozen times older than both of us, yet I feel like we helped a child achieve her dream.”</p><br><p>Adam shrugged. “You know, just because you’ve lived for several hundred years doesn’t mean you always have to act like a wise old man. In some ways, you’re better than others, in some, you’re worse. You may not know something or just have fun, and you may suffer from the same situations as someone who hasn’t lived for 20 years.”</p><br><p>“Yeah, I guess you’re right.”</p><br><br><p>Adam headed forward as he went outside. He took a few more steps as he remembered something and looked back sharply.</p><br><p>Next to the gate stood a large axe and helmet, not thrown away, but neatly stacked as if by a knight who had decided to end one chapter of his life and move on.</p><br><p>“So he too?” Adam smiled bitterly as he remembered the guard. “I don’t know if it was our conversation or the situation on the island that influenced him so much, but I hope he won’t regret his decision, otherwise, I’ll feel guilty.”</p><br><p>Shaking his head, Adam moved on.</p><br><p>He easily crossed the barrier, where Misty was already waiting for him.</p><br><p>She had the same calm expression as before, but her gaze was different, full of pride and disbelief.</p><br><p>“You’re back,” she stated.</p><br><p>Adam touched the back of his neck.</p><br><p>“Yeah, something like that. It was quite a journey.”</p><br><p>“I’m sure it feels like a long time has passed, but you actually returned on the same day you left. Although… time doesn’t matter as much as the events you’ve experienced, does it?”</p><br><p>Adam nodded. “That’s right. No offense to you or Ureyn, but for me, the trials of the White Spire were much more significant.”</p><br><p>For a moment, Misty fell silent as she narrowed her eyes, carefully studying Adam’s aura.</p><br><p>“I see it. You’ve become much stronger. Congratulations.”</p><br><p>It was dry, but Adam knew it would be foolish to expect more from Misty.</p><br><p>Then, something caught the corner of his eye.</p><br><p>Near the barrier, the white orb hovered over the silver vortex. Although he was not a monster, even he was drawn to this energy.</p><br><p>“Is this the reward Norax sent me to the island for?” Adam pointed to the white orb.</p><br><p>Misty nodded. “Yes, but that’s only the most noticeable aspect. Our lands, the Black Cut territory, have grown, and every piece of soil, both on the surface and deep below, is now saturated with pure energy.</p><br><p>“I’m sure that on the very first day, several monsters will successfully evolve thanks to this. Then, with each passing day and month, the monsters will become stronger and stronger. This effect will positively influence our territory for at least the next ten years.”</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, puzzled. “Ten years? But there are only seven years left until the World Wipe. Doesn’t that mean that a third of the time will just be wasted?”</p><br><p>In response, Misty turned toward Norax’s mill.</p><br><p>“That’s right. That’s why it was a risk to send you to the Silver Beacon so late. On the other hand, throughout the world, the next seven years, especially the last three, will be extremely low on energy in anticipation of the collision of the First Star and Last Star. Thanks to you and the boss’s decision, we won’t have that problem.”</p><br><p>Adam’s corners of his lips went up as he looked at the top of the mill.</p><br><p>“It was a risk, but Norax was right. It must be hard for you to have such a reckless and risky boss, right?”</p><br><p>That question created a crack even in Misty’s cold expression as she smiled slightly.</p><br><p>“Well, that’s why he’s the boss and I’m the subordinate. I don’t like risks because they’re too dangerous. You can bet 10 times and lose 9, but Norax’s strength and that of people like him is that one winning time easily covers all the losses. I’m afraid that’s not something you can learn even in a thousand years.”</p><br><br><p>A gust of wind swept over Adam’s shoulders, moving toward Misty’s hair.</p><br><p>“Khm!” Adam coughed. “What happens next?”</p><br><p>Misty turned to him.</p><br><p>“That’s up to you. We’re not your enemies, and you can go wherever you want. But, I, Karso, my boss, and the others would be happy if you stayed with us for one more night. After all, your victory deserves a proper feast, right?”</p><br><p>At that moment, lights began to come on in front of Norax’s mill as numerous figures hurried about to organize the feast as quickly as possible.</p><br><p>From this distance, nothing could be heard, but among their silhouettes, Adam immediately recognized Norax, Narica, and Karso.</p><br><p>“How can I refuse?” Adam shrugged. “Also, what about dessert? Getting one from you would be a bonus.”</p><br><p>Misty turned around.</p><br><p>“It’s possible, now, follow me.”</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand.</p><br>
