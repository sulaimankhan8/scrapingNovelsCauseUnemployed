            <br><p>There were many unique places in the Dead Lands, and External Artifacts were often the reason, especially if some massive Stronghold was based on them.</p><br><p>Adam had yet to enter the Stronghold but encountered something unusual. The Dark Watchers weren't going to attack him like any other monster would, or rather, their strike wasn't physical or aggressive.</p><br><p>In a way, the Dark Watchers were doing their duty, following the rules of the Stronghold to which they belonged.</p><br><p>"Well, well... So most of the Phantoms that came here couldn't even withstand an attack by the auras of two Mid Yellow monsters?" Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>The earlier sadness over the death of the Phantoms in front of the gate was replaced by a feeling very much like disappointment.</p><br><p>"The Plague Reaper's aura was much more frightening, at least that's what I felt at that moment. But... you... even with the amplification from the gate, evoke nothing but moderate interest in me."</p><br><p>His eyes went upward, looking at the two fiery demons willing to turn Adam into nothing more than a handful of ash.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Ignoring Adam's words, the Dark Watchers set to their work - unleashing the full power of their auras upon him.</p><br><p>The purple flames reflected in his blue eyes before swapping to swift white particles.</p><br><p>Adam didn't need to summon the full power of his Spirit for such a work, there was no need as the flames couldn't touch him.</p><br><p>The two demons tried to break through the light layer of white fire burning like a lonely bonfire, but all they accomplished was scorch their paws.</p><br><p>Adam saw an aura in the form of a demon, the Gladius's one, and...</p><br><p>"It was truly terrifying. Compared to his aura, it's nothing." Adam waved his hand dramatically, intensifying his aura, leaving it in free form.</p><br><p>The white flames grew much wider, scaring away the demons - causing them to flee to the gate.</p><br><p>For the Dark Watchers, it was also a challenge, but since Adam wasn't directing his aura at them, they felt only a slight pressure.</p><br><p>Adam watched the guards carefully waiting for one of them to give him a clue as to what to do next, but they did their part.</p><br><br><p>Discover exclusive content at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>With a thud, the rune on the gate lit up brightly with violet flames, illuminating everything around it. Then, the gate slowly came into motion, the heavy plates sliding apart to reveal a passage for Adam.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Dark Watchers clattered their spears to the ground and stepped aside, no longer intending to block Adam's path.</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly, heading forward.</p><br><p>Could he attack the Dark Watchers right now and kill the two monsters? Sure, but as long as he could follow the rules of the fortress and its artifact, he would.</p><br><p>Silvana nodded approvingly.</p><br><p>'I don't know what the military is thinking, but given the effects of the irregular energy here, Phantoms should only participate in necessary fights that can't be avoided.'</p><br><p>The irregular energy didn't make the wounds worse, but the reduced regeneration and weakened healing abilities meant that the cut Adam would get in his first fight would stay with him until the end, only slightly recovered.</p><br><br><p>A few seconds later, Adam was inside the fortress, stopping in the main passageway.</p><br><p>Then, with a deafening rumble, the gate closed. The rune slowly extinguished, and the molten edges fused together due to the high temperature, sealing the gate.</p><br><p>Adam turned around, looking up at the top at how the gate was arranged.</p><br><p>"I see... So if the fortress won't let you pass on, you have to do more than just open the gate or move the slabs out of the way, you have to destroy the seal and..."</p><br><p>Eager to test his theory, Adam walked up to the gate and clenched his fist tightly, tilting his torso back slightly.</p><br><p>He was allowed to go on, so he wasn't worried that it would cause problems, at least Adam hoped so.</p><br><br><p>Taking a wide step forward, Adam's fist turned into a black flash, crashing straight into the gate with all speed.</p><br><p>Bright pain ran through his entire body, and skin peeled off his knuckles, flying apart.</p><br><p>A tiny crack the size of a fingernail or less formed on the gate.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide as his lips quivered in disbelief.</p><br><p>"Fuck... I did some damage, I could probably destroy the gate if I used all my powers, but... They're pretty damn solid."</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam realized that he did the right thing by passing the guards' challenge, forcing the gate to open on its own.</p><br><p>Thinking of other options Adam turned his gaze towards the walls. They were high, but not so high that a group of Phantoms couldn't climb over them, even with the water ring around the fortress.</p><br><p>However, Adam soon realized that this was hardly the best and safest option.</p><br><p>"Oh... Looks like someone bigger than the Dark Watchers or even Blinding Sylphyre is hiding in there." Adam raised his head towards the towers.</p><br><p>The flames from the peaks illuminated the majestic fortress, but now Adam could clearly see that on each tower was a tall shadow with a single large, elongated eye shining like a ghostly lantern.</p><br><p>Adam didn't get a good glimpse of what the four monsters looked like, but one glance was enough to know that they wouldn't miss anyone trying to crawl through the walls in an attempt to get past the main gate.</p><br><p>"Hmm... I hope I don't have to fight them, especially not all of them at once, I definitely won't come out of this fight uninjured. Moreover... I'm going in the right direction, right?"</p><br><p>Silvana thought the question was addressed to her, but not this time.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same black particles quickly formed a rippling path for Adam guiding him forward before just as quickly disappearing.</p><br><p>"Hah, considering I just entered the gate it was a stupid question." Adam smiled bitterly before casting a glance around the courtyard of the fortress that was far larger than any Nest he ever been to and even surpassed in size the Fume Cathedral.</p><br><p>The moon was in no hurry to rise from the horizon, its light would have to wait before it fell upon the dark lands.</p><br><p>But... would that happen tonight?</p>
