            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1278: Broken Hopes (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>The Connected String had pretty strict conditions, but despite the small number of monsters with similar abilities and energy, Adam still had a pretty good choice for a potential opponent.</p><br><p>Many threads pointed to the gray mill, with a few exceptions for the black mills, but Adam shouldn’t consider these options for his own safety.</p><br><p>There were five most active threads in total, and Adam could choose any of them, but… There was someone next to him who could give him a hint.</p><br><p>“Gareyna… I see five brightest threads.” Adam said, without taking his eyes off the mills in the distance. “But, I understand you have a suggestion, right?”</p><br><p>She nodded deeply, pointing to one gray mill in the distance.</p><br><p>It was barely visible because of the other mills and hilltops, but upon closer inspection, Adam could make out one gray mill in the fog.</p><br><p>That one differed from the others because of the large, dry tree, like a vine wrapped around the mill, standing in the middle of a wide but empty expanse where there was nothing but low gray grass.</p><br><p>“I see… You’re right, one of the main threads is leading me right there. Do you think it will be a good opponent for me?” Adam asked.</p><br><p>There was a hint of suspicion in his gaze. Gareyna gave him no reason to doubt her, but Adam wasn’t foolish enough to believe her every word.</p><br><p>After all, they had only met today, and this was her and her people’s territory.</p><br><p>Silvana had warned him about this as well:</p><br><p>‘Don’t trust her without answers. It’s a good sign that she told you about the String Duel, it means she doesn’t want you to die, but… it also means she doesn’t want your opponent to die, that is, one of her people.</p><br><p>‘Perhaps she wants to deliberately send you to this mill so that you will face the one you will lose to. That way, this monster will get your essence, which will help it evolve, and you will become significantly weaker.’</p><br><p>Everything Silvana said made sense, but they both understood that these were just theories. In order to be sure of Gareyna’s sincerity, they first had to hear the answers to their questions.</p><br><p>Gareyna smiled, she could see that Adam was concerned about her honesty.</p><br><p>“Yes. That is my recommendation. Sure, you have no reason to believe me, but you can see for yourself. I can practically guarantee that the other four threads lead to mills where the opponent is either stronger or significantly weaker.”</p><br><p>She waved her hand, leaning on her cheek.</p><br><p>“Go on. You can do it through the Connected String. To start, focus, direct your mind along a thread to mentally place yourself in front of the target. Do this with each mill and then answer whose aura is most similar to yours in terms of strength.”</p><br><p>Adam said nothing and nodded.</p><br><p>He didn’t succeed right away, but after a while, he was able to do it as his mind traveled in one direction, then in a second, third, and so on until he reached the fifth mill.</p><br><p>Each time, his path ended right in front of a mill, feeling its aura billowing in all directions like a powerful flame. Somewhere it was more aggressive, somewhere calmer, but only on the last, fifth mill that Gareyna mentioned, everything was different.</p><br><p>The gray flame strangely attracted Adam, making his heart beat faster than usual. It was as if he was looking at the reflection of his aura, which was very similar to his own, but had significant differences at its core.</p><br><p>“What do you say now?” Gareyna’s voice came from the side.</p><br><p>Adam gulped as he nodded slightly.</p><br><p>“Fine… That’s actually the best option of all, but how did you know that the Connected Thread would lead me there?”</p><br><p>The corners of Gareyna’s lips turned upward.</p><br><p>“Well, I’ve lived long enough to know every mill owner personally, and this young man is no exception. Not all mill owners have the same level of power as I do, as I’m sure you’ve already realized. Many of them are Elders, although… over time, especially among the black mills, there are fewer and fewer of them.”</p><br><p>Adam’s gaze deepened as he immediately understood the reason for these changes.</p><br><p>“You are preparing for the World Wipe and accumulating as much power as possible, aren’t you?”</p><br><p>“Yes, unfortunately, even if you reach the top, you are still nobody in front of the First Star and Last Star. The larger the Lords’ territory, the fewer monsters will have to die and the faster the recovery after the World Wipe will be.”</p><br><p>Everyone knew this bitter truth.</p><br><p>“Alright, let’s get down to business.” Adam waved his hand, not wanting to think about the World Wipe again. “Who is my opponent? Apparently, you know him well.”</p><br><p>“Sure. His name is Ureyn, he’s an Elder, your auras are quite similar in strength. The last time I saw him was a few months ago, but even from here I can tell that he hasn’t gotten any stronger during that time.”</p><br><br><p>“As you said, most of the Gray Needle are sitting inside their mills, but what are they doing?”</p><br><br><p>“The answer will be different for each mill. Some practice or accumulate energy, some conduct experiments, but most just sleep, knowing that in the next seven years, nothing worth their attention is likely to happen.”</p><br><p>“So… They’re just waiting for the World Wipe to happen so they can start moving after that?”</p><br><p>“Correct. There’s not much energy in the world right now, I think you’ve heard about that. There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s a natural process. But that’s not the main reason. Many just don’t want to take risks, and Ureyn is one of them.”</p><br><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head, puzzled.</p><br><p>“Tsk. In that case, we’re not as similar as you think. I’m not going to stop. Seven years is a long time! I’ll have time to do a lot and become much stronger!”</p><br><p>“Hah, I heard the same words from Ureyn five years ago, but during that time his optimism faded and… I want you to rekindle his flame, even if it costs him a painful defeat.”</p><br><p>Then, she pointed down into one of the deep ravines disappearing into the ground.</p><br><p>“That’s why you’re going there — to the Arachne Nest.”</p>
