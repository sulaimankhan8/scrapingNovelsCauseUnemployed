            <br><p>"What... What is she doing here?"</p><br><p>Experience tales with My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Wait, is that Nelya Balo?"</p><br><p>"Of course it is! Can't you see who's walking next to her? It's her brother, Franz Balo!"</p><br><p>Some couldn't contain their emotions and shouted out their thoughts, while some whispered, sending rumors among the guests who would reach the palace very soon.</p><br><p>In any other situation, no one would have paid any attention to Nelya, for although she was a high noble, she was still a Hallow Noble.</p><br><p>However, everyone knew about what happened to her, and also everyone realized that Zarot did it to avenge the Balo Family's rejection of his request.</p><br><p>Moreover, the Balo Family were not on the best of terms with the Rouzet and Marzo Families, thus to see any of them was unexpected.</p><br><p>"They all stare at us so intently... I don't feel good... I want them to stop." Nelya gulped feeling out of place. In her long period of isolation, she completely forgot what it was like to be at public events.</p><br><p>Franz stroked her shoulder encouragingly, a slight smile on his face and his eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>"Don't worry, you'll get used to it soon. In the past, you wouldn't even pay attention to them. Just show that you're not afraid of their stares. I'll give you a little help."</p><br><p>With those words, Franz slid his hand down Nelya's back, forcing her to straighten, her bosom thrust forward. Then, with Franz's help, Nelya spread her shoulders wide.</p><br><p>"Good, and final touch."</p><br><p>Franz smirked and lifted Nelya's chin high with a smooth motion of his finger, her watching eyes seeing a drastically different picture.</p><br><p>"Stop looking down, you're a high noble. Most of the people looking at you are either common nobles or just rich ones. You should proudly look down on them from above and no other way."</p><br><p>Franz's words might have sounded arrogant, but it was what every high noble was taught since birth.</p><br><p>"Yes... Brother, you're right." Nelya's eyes sparkled, turning wide.</p><br><p>She felt much freer as the gazes of the guests were not so formidable and intense now.</p><br><p>Well, their gazes hadn't changed in any way, but Nelya's perception had.</p><br><p>"Good. I recognize my sister now." Franz nodded deeply and stepped forward confidently. Nelya followed gracefully behind her brother, holding him gently by the arm.</p><br><p>Rosalind nodded satisfactorily.</p><br><p>'Ms. Nelya... I hope today will help you recover. Of all the nobles I know, no... of all the people I know, you are the kindest and most innocent. It seems that this cruel world is not worthy of you being here.'</p><br><br><p>Quick footsteps came from outside, seemingly nothing strange, yet Rosalind scowled.</p><br><p>Some man was running in their direction, and he was looking directly at Nelya, who hadn't noticed him yet.</p><br><br><p>Rosalind's silhouette quivered as she turned into a shadow, appearing in front of Nelya a moment later.</p><br><p>Her foot like a sharp spear was placed at the man's neck, her gaze hard and menacing. If Franz ordered her to dispose of this man, Rosalind would immediately do so.</p><br><p>It took the man a few seconds to realize the situation, then his eyes went wide and his face went pale.</p><br><p>"Wait! You misunderstand me!" The man exclaimed, raising his hands. He could feel Rosalind's burning gaze on him.</p><br><p>Franz and Nelya turned around, confused by the man's arrival.</p><br><p>"Who are you?" Franz said sternly as he stepped forward.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Nelya stopped him, extending her hand in front of his chest.</p><br><p>"Brother, wait. I don't think that man meant to hurt me in any way. I can see it in his eyes..."</p><br><p>Nelya smiled kindly, looking at the man.</p><br><br><p>The man silently nodded a few times.</p><br><p>Rosalind looked at Nelya, then at the man, and nodded slightly, lowering her foot to the ground.</p><br><p>The man breathed a sigh of relief, adjusted his tie, and pulled a white card from his pocket that looked like a business card.</p><br><p>He bent low, holding the card with both hands before Nelya.</p><br><p>"Ms. Nelya, I'm glad I can see you again after all this time... We haven't met, but I've always been struck by your beauty when we've happened to be at the same events. Please, if you get a chance, visit my bakery."</p><br><p>Nelya's cheeks flushed slightly. She had only received compliments from Franz, Rosalind, and the servants over the past few months, but... she realized they couldn't say otherwise, so to hear a sincere compliment from someone outside the family was something Nelya's shattered self-esteem so desperately needed.</p><br><p>"Your bakery...?" Nelya mumbled embarrassedly, taking the card from the man's hands.</p><br><br><p>"Sugar Bliss... What an intriguing name."</p><br><p>The man nodded without raising his head.</p><br><p>"Yes, we focus on a variety of desserts and cakes, but if you want delicious, freshly baked bread, you're sure to find something to match your appetite."</p><br><p>Nelya was silent for a while before hiding the business card firmly in her palms and nodding gently.</p><br><p>"Thank you for the offer. I promise I will make time to visit your bakery. You seem to be not only a good person but also a great owner..."</p><br><p>Then, Nelya made a serious face and stepped forward confidently, though inside she was ready to melt with embarrassment.</p><br><p>Franz froze in place, blinking rarely and not believing what he saw.</p><br><br><p>"Yes!" Franz exclaimed to himself before jumping up joyfully, as if he just won the jackpot at the casino, beating his fist to the sky like a winner.</p><br><p>He turned to the man who hesitantly straightened up, not knowing if he was courteous enough with Nelya.</p><br><br><p>Franz's palm slammed the man on the back.</p><br><p>"You did good! Fuck yes! That was just what I needed!"</p><br><p>Franz's seemingly harmless clap made the man's face twist as he was ready to scream in pain.</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, Rosalind's palm covered the man's mouth and kept him from falling.</p><br><p>"Sir, I think that was too strong." Rosalind cast a stern, reproachful look at Franz.</p><br><p>Franz scratched the back of his head awkwardly and patted the man on the shoulder.</p><br><p>"Sorry buddy, I was just too excited. In return, I'll also visit your bakery with my sister!"</p><br><p>Then, Franz hurriedly followed Nelya, his eyes shining brightly with anticipation that this was just the first good thing of the day.</p>
