            <br><p>Every creature, whether it was a monster or a human, whether it was an arrogant person or not, everyone to one degree or another had either a teacher or someone they learned from and became stronger.</p><br><p>Sure, the differences were significant in a situation where the apprentice had a teacher, and they spent a long time practicing and working on weak points. Adam had lived like that for the last three months under Tron's mentorship, and at times Max had taken over that role.</p><br><p>But... oddly enough, even though it was a long period, it didn't affect Adam's path - at all.</p><br><p>True, he became stronger and learned to use his abilities better, but Adam didn't get anything new, it's not about abilities or equipment but about memories, because they were part of the Phantom's path.</p><br><p>Based on past events the Two Walls were created, this was Phantom's main obstacle on his way to the K3-Level, opening up completely different possibilities than anything that came before.</p><br><p>What or who were the teachers then, the imitation figures for Adam?</p><br><p>Well, in his case, it was pretty simple, although it wasn't a popular option-</p><br><br><p>He fought them, he killed them, and a lot of times he could die.</p><br><br><p>In most cases, if he had fought alone, if he had no mates, he would've been dead long ago, buried deep beneath the cold earth.</p><br><p>Of the closest fights falling under this category is the fight against Essence Thunder Demon and, of course, against the Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>These were not fair battles, not for Phantoms, but for monsters who fought alone against squads of experienced warriors. And, more often than not, they won.</p><br><p>But... although the Essence Thunder Demon and the Plague Reaper had influenced Adam and, to some extent, became part of his power, they were in some ways inferior to one monster that was not like the others.</p><br><br><p>The first Crown Type monster Adam defeated and as a result received Power Gene from him.</p><br><p>Sure enough, after Adam moved up to K2-Level, his Power Gene, as well as everything else, changed.</p><br><p>Previously, the Steel Knight's Power Gene performed a simple function and made Adam a bit stronger, looking pretty much the same as his longtime opponent.</p><br><br><p>After using the First Key, the previous Power Gene turned into the intimidating and mysterious - Desecrated Sword.</p><br><p>Desecrated Sword was a long sword that formed from two, the left side was straight and sharp like a blade, while the right half was covered in square teeth like a wicked saw.</p><br><p>Your journey continues at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>At its first appearance, the Desecrated Sword slammed into the Evolution Tree, literally smashing into the tree's tough bark, breaking it as if it were something fragile, unable to defend itself against the power hidden in the sword.</p><br><p>A thick, dark crimson energy constantly emanated from the Desecrated Sword, maintaining a sphere around it.</p><br><p>It seemed that this sphere was not part of the sword, it was a defense mechanism, but the sphere was not protecting the sword, but everything around it, including Adam, even though it was his inner space.</p><br><br><p>The tip of the spear crashed into a long needle ready to break into shards from any strong enough strike, then the owner of the spear attacked a few more times unable to reach his target and hurt Adam.</p><br><p>'Wait... Something is wrong...'</p><br><p>This thought settled not only in Fromund's mind, Silvana, Arayna, and many others thought the same thing.</p><br><p>Soon, they noticed that something strange was happening to Adam.</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes, trying to see Adam. Then, she saw that his single, left eye was completely blank, devoid of light and color.</p><br><p>A realization like a lightning strike went through Silvana's body, reaching her mind.</p><br><p>'No... Did he lose consciousness?'</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, her face turned as pale as a sheet of paper.</p><br><p>Arayna, coming to the same conclusions, sighed heavily:</p><br><p>"He only fights by following his instincts... His body moves on its own."</p><br><p>Then, she turned to Silvana and bowed low, a guilty look on her face.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry, but I believe it will be over soon. He'll continue to defend himself through his strong instincts, but... when his needle breaks, it'll be over."</p><br><p>In complete silence, Silvana clenched her fists tightly, her nails digging into her soft skin, releasing trickles of blood running down her fingers. A grimace of utter fear filled her face, unwilling to accept such a result.</p><br><p>But... if it was hard for Silvana to watch Adam lose even though he waited a long time to win, for someone else it was a disaster of immeasurable scale.</p><br><br><p>Osana screamed in wild anger, clutching her pink hair.</p><br><p>She stood on the edge of the box, her heart beating fast and tears streaming from her eyes. Osana realized that if Adam didn't get up now, her life would be ruined, and... considering to what point she had brought the wedding, she would only have a nightmare waiting for her that even the demons in hell would be terrified of.</p><br><p>"ADAM!" Osana screamed with all her might, the words came from the depths of her soul bursting out of her throat.</p><br><p>"Get up! You must WIN!"</p><br><br><p>[She's calling you...]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree's calm voice reached Adam's ears, but for some reason, it didn't catch his attention in any way.</p><br><p>[How strange... Isn't this girl important to you?]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree became confused for a moment, slowly speaking while Osana's cries, or rather pleas were clearly audible, each one of them.</p><br><p>[As far as I'm aware... You must fulfill her wish....]</p><br><br><p>[Doesn't... Her desperate pleas for help motivate you?"</p><br><p>"I don't care." Adam rudely replied, casting a glare at Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>[Hmm...? I don't understand...]</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand stiffly like a sharp blade.</p><br><p>''I honored all of her wishes a long time ago. Her third wish was to fight on The Rule of Power, I did it, so... only one thing matters now."</p><br><p>His eyes, here he had no wounds, grew deeper and darker.</p><br><p>"I want to win! I want to use all my power to do it! You said you would help me! So do it!"</p><br><p>[I see... So winning is more important than this girl's wishes and fate? Good answer...]</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree shook several times, then white particles came out, creating a long stair in the darkness leading straight to the Desecrated Sword.</p><br><p>[In that case... Go ahead. What are you waiting for?]</p>
