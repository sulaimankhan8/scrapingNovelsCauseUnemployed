            <br><p>The table was covered with many dishes cooked in just two hours, from appetizers to main courses and various desserts.</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz were preparing for a long conversation with Erik, while Silvana and Chloe were putting drinks and the last dishes on the table.</p><br><p>The girls acted in a hurry, not because they were rushed by their Phantoms, but rather because of their admiration for Julia's abilities.</p><br><p>Chloe and Silvana cooked only a few of the dozen dishes and Julia did the rest. Despite her appearance and demeanor, she proved to be far more capable than the two young Operators.</p><br><br><p>Silvana put a glass down in front of Adam, and her eyes darted to Julia who was finishing the last dish.</p><br><p>'Looks can be deceiving, right?' Silvana bit her lip, 'I thought we'd just do some appetizers, but... she cooks for Erik like a king!'</p><br><p>Silvana couldn't understand what exactly she was feeling: envy, admiration, or annoyance?</p><br><p>But, one thing was clear to her - she wanted to have the same opportunity to give all of herself to her Phantom.</p><br><p>With a slight movement, Julia removed the stained apron, tossed it aside, and placed the last dish in the center of the table.</p><br><p>Then, she sat down next to Erik, her face serious as if she were taking an exam.</p><br><p>In complete silence, Erik picked up a knife and fork, cut a piece off the rainbow fish, and guided the fork to his mouth.</p><br><p>Erik gulped as he placed the cutlery on the edge of his plate.</p><br><p>"Perfect, juicy fish with a crispy crust and just the right spices, the perfect balance."</p><br><p>Without warning, Erik kissed Julia on the cheek.</p><br><p>Her cold expression shattered in an instant, sparks shone in her eyes, only pure ecstasy from his praise remained.</p><br><p>"Agh..." Julia gasped, touching her cheeks, "I'm so glad you liked it... I tried."</p><br><p>The others looked at her, baffled, trying to figure out what kind of strange personality Julia had.</p><br><p>Soon, she noticed it.</p><br><p>Julia's face turned evil in an instant, twisting into a ghastly grimace.</p><br><p>"Argh?" she grunted, "What are you bitches looking at? You'll never get a kiss like that! So watch and be jealous!"</p><br><p>Silvana, Reinz and Chloe flinched. Just when they thought Julia was acting normal she proved once again that she wasn't.</p><br><p>"Hahaha..." Adam laughed briefly cutting the steak into slices, "Mr. Erik, you have a great Operator, you're very lucky."</p><br><p>"Sure." Erik shrugged nonchalantly, "One of the most important jobs of a Phantom is to constantly maintain and improve his relationship with his Operator. If you've passed K0 and even more so K1-Level, then you're a match - all that's left to do is keep what you have."</p><br><p>With that, Erik leaned forward, his hands folded in a lock.</p><br><p>"Girls, please enjoy the table, after all, it is your labor." Erik held out his hand and looked at Adam with Reinz, "I have much to discuss with these two young men."</p><br><p>Soon the wine filled three glasses. Erik took a short sip and smiled weakly.</p><br><p>"Adam, Reinz, what do you know about the Energy Control? This is a serious question. I want to test your knowledge."</p><br><p>They looked at each other, Reinz decided to start first, "The Energy Control is a technique that allows Phantoms to strengthen or enhance a selected body part. You can make a fist punch stronger or gather all the energy in the back area to defend against an attack from behind."</p><br><p>Erik nodded, waiting for Adam's response.</p><br><p>"Well... I honestly don't know what to add." Adam scratched the back of his head remembering everything he saw or knew, soon his eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"Oh, I recall something... One time I was fighting against one very powerful Phantom. He used the Energy Control in a way that I don't know how to do."</p><br><p>Adam twitched his hand, "He amplified his weapon, it allowed him to defend against my attack that should have defeated him."</p><br><p>Chloe and Reinz looked at each other. They didn't know what Adam was talking about, but to Silvana it was obvious. She remembered Adam's battle against Damien.</p><br><p>Erik smirked faintly, "Good, what you saw is part of the Full Energy Control. The thing is - what you possess at the moment is only one of three manifestations of the Energy Control."</p><br><p>Then, Erik picked up the table knife and touched the tip of his finger.</p><br><p>Nothing happened, a normal knife was not able to wound Erik, but he kept pressing the knife.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The blade shuddered, breaking under the pressure. The sharp part flew off to the side, crashing into the just-baked bread.</p><br><p>"As you can see, not even a hundred knives like that could scratch me. Well, it works the same way for you. After all, you are K3-Phantoms." Erik uttered before picking up the fork, "But... If I put my energy into a simple fork, it will stop being a useless piece of metal and turn into a deadly weapon."</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Erik's aura intensified causing everyone else to catch their breath. Only Julia remained immune to his influence, for her it had long since become routine.</p><br><p>Red energy enveloped the fork, the tips were shaking actively - a little more and the fork would break apart, but Erik controlled his energy perfectly.</p><br><br><p>It was worth the slight pressure on his palm as the tips pierced his skin which used to be tougher than steel. Four drops of blood were about to rush out, but Erik didn't let it happen.</p><br><p>"I think this demonstration is enough. What you just saw is called the Outer Energy Control. One of three types." Erik set the fork aside, the small wound already gone from his palm.</p><br><p>Adam looked at him seriously, "One of three? What are the other two called in that case? What energy control have I been using all this time?"</p><br><p>"The Energy Control that allows you to strengthen your body is called the Inner Energy Control - the first type. The Outer Energy Control is the second type, it allows you to empower external objects, whether it's a sword, a stone, or a fork. And... about the last one..."</p><br><p>Erik laughed briefly, curiosity evident in his voice.</p><br><p>"It's the Infusive Energy Control. The first one enhances your body, the second one enhances your weapons, and the third one enhances your abilities."</p><br><p>Their eyes sparkled.</p><br><p>Erik leaned back in his chair, "Now, the power of your abilities depends not only on their essence and your might but also on how you use the Full Energy control."</p>
