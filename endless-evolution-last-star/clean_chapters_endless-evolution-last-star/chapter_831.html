            <br><p>One of the first people Adam met after becoming a Phantom was undoubtedly Douglas.</p><br><p>He seemed like an ordinary high-ranking military man: superior status, access to the Citadel's secrets, and vast opportunities backed by power.</p><br><p>However, the more Adam learned about Douglas the more he doubted his conclusions about him.</p><br><p>Last time, Adam worked together with Douglas when he created his First Key. Was that a coincidence?</p><br><p>Well, Adam couldn't know that, because then Damien decided to fight him to test his powers.</p><br><p>Douglas was always there when something important was happening. Gradually, this made Adam suspicious, yet he couldn't deny that he was grateful to Douglas for many things.</p><br><p>'Hah...' Adam chuckled inwardly, 'I wonder what's in store for me this time? Even though he's a regular person he had no problem watching my fight against Damien. He has great fortitude.'</p><br><br><p>With his chest thrust forward, Douglas entered the room. Behind him was Seyrina, who despite her status as a K4-Phantom showed Douglas respect.</p><br><p>Before Silvana or Adam could respond, Douglas pushed his chair away from the table and took his seat.</p><br><p>With a slight nod, Seyrina did the same.</p><br><p>"Douglas..." Adam muttered, looking at the military man before him, comparing Douglas's appearance to what he saw in Silvana's memories.</p><br><p>'It's been a few years since that moment, back then Silvana wasn't even an Operator yet, she was just about to embark on that path. Yet it looks the same as it did before.'</p><br><p>Adam continued his musings, for this whole situation seemed strange to him.</p><br><p>'Sure, one would assume that with the highest technology, it's not hard to keep young, but... that's not the point.'</p><br><p>With mild curiosity, Adam narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>'He hasn't aged since then, but he hasn't gotten any younger. It's as if he's frozen at one point or, on the contrary, still aging, but very slowly.</p><br><p>It was unclear whether Adam could have figured it out, but he didn't have time for that now.</p><br><p>Douglas smiled wider, not reacting to Adam's stare.</p><br><p>"It's been a while. I heard about your fight at the Moon Colosseum, congratulations on your victory."</p><br><p>Puzzlement covered Adam's face.</p><br><p>"Thanks... I guess?"</p><br><p>He didn't understand why Douglas decided to mention it now. For Adam, the Rule of Power and Osana's wedding had become a thing of the past, even the Crimson Monarch was now behind.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, the nobles eventually got to you. I'll tell you that it's not surprising, what's surprising is the other thing."</p><br><p>With a powerful laugh, Douglas leaned forward, pointing at Adam with his right hand as if he had picked him out.</p><br><p>"Right after that, you managed to do something grander. Well, at least for you. I don't take crowd noise into account."</p><br><p>Douglas leaned back in his chair, tapping the table slowly.</p><br><p>"When Seyrina informed me of the encounter, I read the report. Damn, an unknown monster, the Overlord Type, and an unexpected Eclipse. There's a certain problem with Eclipse..."</p><br><p>For a brief moment, almost imperceptibly, Douglas's gaze grew darker before he regained his cheerful expression.</p><br><p>"But, otherwise, great job. I can't remember when the Phantom destroyed the Two Walls and filled the Star Seal in one mission. You're the kind of guy who'll miss dozens of nights, but make up for it in one and still add a significant amount."</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head, feeling uneasy. He didn't know why, but praise specifically from Douglas made him evoke warm emotions.</p><br><p>It was always nice to hear recognition of accomplishments, but in Douglas's case, it seemed to Adam that Douglas was actually diving into the battle tape to give his honest opinion. It wasn't just a formality to him.</p><br><p>Douglas nodded deeply, Adam's reaction satisfied him.</p><br><p>"You have become remarkably strong. I'm sure the day is not far off when you'll become a K4-Phantom, but..."</p><br><p>Taking it seriously, Douglas glanced at Silvana.</p><br><p>"Now your Operator suffers for it. Agh, Silvana, I feel guilty about suggesting Adam work with you. That guy is just a storm of problems."</p><br><br><p>Silvana exclaimed sharply, forcing a hovering silence in the room. The loss reflected in her gaze, it seemed she didn't expect it herself.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry..." she slowly returned to her seat, her eyes downcast, "It's just, it's not Adam's fault he got so strong. I'm weak, I have to, no... I want to catch up to him so I can remain as his Operator."</p><br><p>There was no comment, no approval, no judgment.</p><br><p>Douglas said nothing, no emotion showed on his face.</p><br><p>However, inwardly he nodded deeply, his little test successfully passed.</p><br><p>After a while, Douglas gazed at Adam, his smile growing wider.</p><br><p>"Adam, let's not waste any time. You need to become a K3-Phantom and you don't have a thousand years to fill the Second Key with energy, do you?"</p><br><br><p>Douglas raised an eyebrow, impressed.</p><br><br><p>Adam put his palm to his chest, his eyes deep, a sense of certainty in his voice.</p><br><p>"It'll only take me a few weeks. I realized it's about the stars, I need to connect them one by one."</p><br><p>Seyrina's eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>"Oh, so you figured it out so quickly." Douglas rubbed his chin thoughtfully, "I see. Well, one way or another you should hurry. You have another urgent task besides the Second Key."</p><br><p>Silvana and Adam exchanged a glance. She could feel the energy building up in her Evolution Sprout. Adam understood that as well.</p><br><p>Then, he turned to Douglas.</p><br><p>"So, you both know that creating the Second Key is a long endeavor. What's the solution? How do I speed things up enough to get it done in a few days? I don't want to take any chances, especially with Silvana's life on the line."</p><br><p>"That fire..." he muttered.</p><br><p>"It can't happen again."</p><br><p>As if expecting his question, Douglas crossed his arms over his chest and lifted his chin, a gleam running across his eyes.</p><br><p>"Well, for that we have to go to one place - the center of the Citadel."</p>
