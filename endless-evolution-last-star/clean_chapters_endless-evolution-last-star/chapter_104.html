            <br><p>Prime Type, Crown Type, Essence Type, and Conqueror Type - these and all existing Types, were created out of necessity, not for convenience in categorizing monsters.</p><br><p>Each Type was different in some way because if a monster was simply stronger or bigger than the others, threat level and white/red book were more than enough to determine the danger of the monster.</p><br><p>In a way, Type was a reward, a title that only the worthy could earn. Those who possessed something unique, towering above the rest.</p><br><p>Prime Type was the epitome of strength and power. Crown Type represented experience and countless battles, and Essence Type was pure firepower.</p><br><p>The Conqueror Type was somewhat unusual even among the other Types, as the main threat of this Type was not the monster but its subordinates.</p><br><p>Snow Imots were Blue Threat Level monsters, even a thousand of them were not capable of defeating dozens of Phantoms working together.</p><br><p>However... any army, even the weakest, could become many times stronger and more effective with the arrival of a worthy leader.</p><br><p>Conqueror Snow Imot not only boosted the morale of its fellows but actually made them stronger. It was enough to move them one step higher, making them almost as strong as Fury Snow Imots.</p><br><br><p>The Snow Imots burst forward, with blue auras around their bodies and golden eyes filled with confidence.</p><br><p>"Alright. Keep your distance and split into small groups! If you're going to use abilities, take turns! You shouldn't needlessly waste such a valuable resource!" Alexia said confidently before rushing forward. Despite her words, she ran alone with a serious look.</p><br><p>Adam cast a glance at her. He realized that Alexia was strong, but wasn't sure if it was the right decision.</p><br><p>"Hey! You!" A man with a massive sword called out to Adam, with two other Phantoms standing beside him.</p><br><p>"Let's work together before this wave is over."</p><br><p>'Agreeing would be the right thing to do.' Silvana said calmly, 'They're quite capable and won't be a burden to you. At least for the first wave.'</p><br><br><p>"Sure. If there are too many Snow Imots, I'll use my Nexus. You can count on me." Adam said calmly before running up to them.</p><br><p>A few seconds later, their group of four faced the first boosted Snow Imots.</p><br><p>The monsters were slightly larger, five, but their temporary leader took on two of them, holding them back until the others could help him.</p><br><p>'Hmm... At the moment, I'm able to handle most Purple Threat Level monsters, these ones are obviously weaker, but will it be easy without abilities?' Adam pondered, taking a step forward.</p><br><p>Snow Imot's pupils narrowed as the monster raised its paw to attack, thrusting its tight fist towards Adam.</p><br><p>Snow Imots had no unique abilities, unusual body parts, limbs, or organs. All they could count on was their powerful bodies and massive fists.</p><br><p>Phantoms, when fighting Snow Imots, had to avoid the strengths of their opponents, thus Adam would have to dodge this strike to then launch a series of quick attacks. This was the most pragmatic and effective way to battle Snow Imots.</p><br><p>However, Adam wasn't going to dodge, he just clenched his fist tightly and countered in the same way.</p><br><br><p>Their fists clashed, one was several times bigger, like a giant about to smack an ant.</p><br><p>However... if the ant was big enough, then lifting even a dozen giants wouldn't be a problem.</p><br><br><p>The impact caused a ring of wind diverging to the sides as the momentum traveled through Adam's arm straight to the monster's fist.</p><br><p>"RRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!"</p><br><p>The shockwave threw Snow Imot aside with a painful roar, as three of the monster's four fingers were broken.</p><br><p>Adam looked at his fist as a slight smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>'I could probably throw him back before passing Elemental Circle, but not that far, and I wouldn't break his fingers.' Adam pondered, gradually realizing exactly how much stronger he had become.</p><br><p>Adam was under no illusions. He realized that Elemental Circle as well as Elemental Root were mostly defense mechanisms. It made him stronger, but only a little bit, one step. Adam just wanted to find out how long that step was and active combat was the most appropriate place for that.</p><br><p>"Good job. It looks like someone decided to focus on physical strength, doesn't it?" The girl with red hair smiled as she swung her long axe.</p><br><p>Without resistance, the axe entered the monster's shoulder, letting out streams of blood flying in front of the redhead's predatory eyes.</p><br><p>"You're right. They're not bad." Adam muttered, staring at the leader of the group and the young man with blue hair. Together, the five of them formed quite a powerful team. None of them had yet to use their Order.</p><br><p>'Yes, but you shouldn't relax, you haven't dealt with your opponent yet.' Silvana said calmly.</p><br><br><p>Snow Imot was holding onto his paw with a pained look, and strangely enough, the monster decided to retreat!</p><br><p>''He's running away...? This aura, not only made them stronger but also gave them a boost in intelligence?" Adam raised an eyebrow, slightly surprised.</p><br><p>Then, he shrugged and ran forward with all speed. Under his quick and powerful strides, the ice cracked, preventing the monster from getting too far away.</p><br><br><p>Adam leaped forward, jumping over the monster and doing a somersault. His foot came down right on Snow Imot's head, driving it into the ground with a loud crack from the breaking skull.</p><br><p>"Alright, this one's ready." Adam shook the dust off his hands and summoned Revolve.</p><br><p>[Received the gene of the Snow Imot (Enhanced) - x2]</p><br><p>'Hmm? Two genes at once? Hmph, it looks like Conqueror Type not only transferred its power to them but also made their internal resources reach the next level.' Adam internally muttered before heading forward, for the next group of Snow Imots was already moving to their side!</p><br><p>Their group was doing well without any problems. Only their leader had to use his Order, as he was constantly taking on two or even three Snow Imots.</p><br><p>Soon, the Snow Imots began to avoid them as they realized they couldn't win. However, this was happening everywhere, because even with a boost, Snow Imots couldn't defeat so many K1-Phantoms.</p><br><p>There were still localized battles in some places, but there was one spot that Snow Imots avoided, like the plague.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, only one person was standing there, Alexia, with over twenty corpses of the Snow Imots lying around her.</p><br><p>There was a little blood on her face, and her gaze was calm and serene as usual. She stretched her shoulder as she slowly stepped forward towards Conqueror Snow Imot.</p><br><p>It seemed like her battle was easy or even harmless, but... an unprepared person would probably be horrified by the sight.</p><br><p>Snow Imots weren't just lying dead on the ground. Their bodies had been torn apart, some had their heads blown off, some had their spines ripped out, and some had just been turned into a piece of meat.</p><br><p>"Fine, the next wave should be coming soon, so let's finish this quickly." Alexia said with an emotionless face, staring intently at Conqueror Snow Imot.</p>
