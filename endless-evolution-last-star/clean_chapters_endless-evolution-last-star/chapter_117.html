            <br><p>The Phantoms, pursued by the North Keeper, watched in horror as the monster fought Adam and Alexia.</p><br><p>Some of them were experienced enough to realize how strong these three were, while the newcomers were completely baffled, so much so that someone was even going to help them!</p><br><p>"Come on! If we all attack together, we'll kill him! We shouldn't run away like before! This way we'll just be chopped up like pigs in a slaughterhouse!"</p><br><p>They were K0-Phantoms, not very experienced, but active and enthusiastic. However, in this case, it was simple stupidity that would only lead them to death.</p><br><p>"Freeze!" Ester exclaimed loudly enough to be heard by all the squads approaching them, "Get out of there as soon as possible! Either North Keeper will kill you or those two! There's nothing you can do! Right now, you're nothing more than collateral damage!"</p><br><p>The Phantoms were willing to believe Ester, after all, many saw what Adam had done, but at the same time, they didn't want to abandon their fellows. They understood why Adam had done it, he had a valid reason.</p><br><br><p>North Keeper burst into a cascade of sharp crystals, aiming his blades at Alexia.</p><br><p>Her pupils narrowed as she perfectly dodged North Keeper's blade that swept close to her face, leaving a thin cut on her cheek.</p><br><p>Then, she quickly attacked, but North Keeper managed to put up a block.</p><br><p>Alexia's smirked, "Hah, you think that's going to help you? I'll break through any defense if I have to!"</p><br><p>She twisted her wrist sharply and stepped forward, creating a momentum that threw North Keeper back - towards the Phantoms.</p><br><p>'Why the fuck are they still standing here? I told them to leave!' Adam inwardly resented it, for he knew that neither he nor Alexia was going to stop.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>Alexia sprinted forward in pursuit of the North Keeper. She clenched her fist tightly, intending to attack again, and it was unlikely that North Keeper was ready to block her blow, for his hands were trembling slightly.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" The young man's eyes went wide when he felt a cold hand on his shoulder.</p><br><p>Before the young man could realize anything, the North Keeper pulled him to himself, using as a human shield.</p><br><p>The young man saw Alexia in front of him and smiled slightly. He knew she would stop, but he felt bad for preventing her.</p><br><br><p>Alexia's fist plunged into the young man's chest, ripping through his flesh and quickly reaching North Keeper's stomach, causing his eyes to go wide with pain.</p><br><p>The young man looked at Alexia in disbelief. He couldn't accept that Alexia had actually done this.</p><br><p>Before moving on, Alexia only cast a cold glance at him - without a bit of regret or guilt.</p><br><p>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!"</p><br><p>This was enough to cause the K0-Phantoms to panic. They ran away as fast as possible, not wanting to become Alexia's next victim.</p><br><p>While dozens of people ran west, some moved east - quickly joining his partner.</p><br><p>"Finally, we're the only ones left here." Adam said calmly, bringing his needle down in a second grip.</p><br><p>"Yes!" Alexia exclaimed, attacking at the same time as him.</p><br><p>North Keeper could no longer use the other Phantoms to defend themselves, so now only their mastery decided everything.</p><br><p>Every second, Adam and Alexia were attacking. Adam's attacks were slower, but much stronger and more accurate thanks to the second grip, while Alexia was just throwing a hail of blows at North Keeper.</p><br><p>North Keeper didn't have any special protection other than his armor, the main purpose of which was to make him faster without restricting his movements. He could only rely on his blades, reaction, and speed, and so far... that was more than enough.</p><br><p>'Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! How strong is he?!' Alexia inwardly exclaimed while cascades of sparks flew before her eyes.</p><br><p>The North Keeper's hands moved faster and faster with each passing second. Although Adam and Alexia, thanks to Resonance, were attacking with perfect timing, North Keeper was just faster. It wasn't difficult for him to block their attacks with his ice blades and sometimes even counterattack, leaving cuts on their bodies.</p><br><p>"Owen!" Bryda exclaimed, turning towards him.</p><br><p>"Yeah... I know. I just had to get ready. They won't have much time, so I had to wait out the right moment." Owen smirked before using his Nexus.</p><br><p>His shield was covered in thick blue energy, actively burning like a flame.</p><br><p>Then, he raised his shield high and knocked it to the ground. All the energy vanished in an instant.</p><br><p>At the same moment, from the sky, like a heavenly blessing, blue rays fell on Adam and Alexia, leaving azure, spiky crosses on their chests.</p><br><p>"Alright... That's it for now..." Owen whispered, before collapsing without strength.</p><br><p>Adam and Alexia felt a powerful surge of energy, they became faster and stronger, and their fatigue seemed to disappear. However, this effect would only last for a few minutes, then they would feel even worse than before.</p><br><p>'We should end the fight right here and now!' Adam and Alexia thought simultaneously.</p><br><p>Soon, North Keeper could no longer handle the pressure coming from Adam and Alexia. Then, neither the position of the moon, nor the beginning of dawn, nor the words of their Operators mattered.</p><br><p>Everything was decided in a few fractions of a second, too fast for anyone but the three of them to understand the situation.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Fred, standing in the distance, began to prepare a powerful shot. His arm was stretched to its limit, holding a huge energy arrow - that one was different from all the ones he had used before.</p><br><p>Adam and Alexia cast a quick glance at Fred, realizing what they had to do.</p><br><p>Then, Adam lunged forward, bringing his needle down on North Keeper with all his might, forcing him to use two swords to defend himself.</p><br><p>Alexia immediately took advantage of this, dashed next to North Keeper, and knocked him down, only to grab his leg and throw him high up.</p><br><p>It seemed to make no sense, but soon, the white arrow came close to North Keeper, ending up right in front of his face.</p><br><p>Fred smirked. Another second, and he would kill the 4th Rank monster!</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, North Keeper grabbed Fred's arrow, clutching it tightly like a projectile.</p><br><p>"No way..." Fred shuddered in disbelief.</p><br><p>With the next breath, North Keeper threw Fred's arrow at the nearest cluster of Phantoms - causing a devastating explosion that killed more than a dozen.</p><br><br><p>Adam bounced off Alexia's shoulders, jumping high enough to thrust his needle, accurately piercing North Keeper's neck.</p><br><p>North Keeper's eyes went wide as he swung his blades, about to slash Adam, but Adam simply used Second Order, summoning silver claws and defending against the blades with his arm. It was more than enough for one attack.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Alexia jumped after him, but she wasn't going to attack, for their time was coming to an end!</p><br><br><p>Alexia grabbed North Keeper's legs tightly, at the knees, before pulling her arms down with all her might, while Adam swung his needle upward.</p><br><p>North Keeper's head snapped off, as well as the lower part of his body, revealing his bulging insides and a river of blood pouring all around.</p>
