            <h4>Chapter 1356: Fake Lord</h4><br><br><p>The porcelain cups shattered one after another as black tea splashed across the glass sphere next to the luxurious table.
</p><br><p>"You little bastard!" Bertrada exclaimed in anger, smashing the tea set in a fit of rage. From the moment Adam flew up on black wings, her anger reached unprecedented heights.
</p><br><p>She grabbed the edge of the table, staring at the mirror in front of her, watching Adam disappear and reappear, destroying one glass cannon after another.
</p><br><p>This continued until Adam broke the last cannon and finally stopped to challenge the Crystal Golem to a fight.
</p><br><p>"He can fly? SHIT! When did the aggressive K4-Phantom acquire such abilities? What’s more, those are combat wings, he easily broke through every barrier!"
</p><br><p>As Norax said, Bertrada always tries to make a contender put on a show for her enjoyment, but in the end, the contender loses, and she doesn’t have to obey the rules and give out rewards.
</p><br><p>By doing this repeatedly, she abused the rules, as it was a gray area, but it didn’t matter because she wasn’t technically breaking anything.
</p><br><p>"Mistress..." Mona muttered uncertainly, she hadn’t seen Bertrada in this state for a long time.
</p><br><p>"Tsk!" She growled. "I underestimated him. That golem will never be able to stop him. Although... There is something I can do."
</p><br><p>For a moment, a sly smile covered Bertrada’s face, which frightened Mona. Strange. She should be happy for her mistress, or... no?
</p><br><br><br><p>Adam descended to the ground, and a few seconds later, the Crystal Golem did the same. A wave of dust ran tremulously across the ground from his great body.
</p><br><p>It was easy to forget just how big the Crystal Golem was. From a distance, the effect wasn’t as strong, but now, Adam had the opportunity to understand the full scale of the problem.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, you are a big guy." Adam raised his head to meet the Crystal Golem’s gaze.
</p><br><p>Stomp. Stomp. Stomp.
</p><br><p>With each step, the Crystal Golem shook the ground and knocked down trees whose tops only reached his chest.
</p><br><p>It was a true giant that seemed impossible to stop.
</p><br><p>Adam still didn’t know what he needed to do to pass the second trial, but it was obvious that if he defeated all his enemies, he would find the solution fairly quickly.
</p><br><p>The Crystal Golem before him was his last obstacle.
</p><br><p>"GHOOOOO!" The Crystal Golem let out a low growl as he swung for the attack.
</p><br><p>A fist the size of a boulder was supposed to crush the insolent human like a bug, leaving only a bloody stain on the ground.
</p><br><br><p>"Weak," Adam whispered, reaching out his hand.
</p><br><p>The great fist and the calm palm met.
</p><br><br><p>Winds burst out in all directions, rustling the treetops and the tips of Adam’s hair.
</p><br><p>The Crystal Golem’s eyes widened in disbelief as he looked at the tiny creature from his perspective, which didn’t even flinch. Adam remained in the same spot where he was, he didn’t take a single step.
</p><br><p>"You’re big and scary, right?" Adam asked mockingly. "Your body can store a lot of energy, making you really strong, but..."
</p><br><p>He looked up at the Crystal Golem with contempt.
</p><br><p>"What’s the point if your aura isn’t any stronger than mine, but even weaker? You can’t even focus all your power in one spot because of your size. You’re just stupid, aren’t you?"
</p><br><p>After countless trials, tens and hundreds of years, the Crystal Golem would never have thought that he would have to face such an arrogant human. What’s more, this bastard in front of him was right.
</p><br><p>However, before the Crystal Golem could fall into despair, three flashes shone brightly in the sky.
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes narrowed as one flash after another slammed into the Crystal Golem’s chest.
</p><br><p>His aura, which had previously been slightly inferior to Adam’s, burst upward in a powerful stream, causing the space to tremble.
</p><br><p>The crystals all over the golem’s body shone brightly, filling with power that immediately raised it several levels, making it as strong as the Silver Gargoyle from the first trial.
</p><br><p>"GHAHAHAHAH!" The Crystal Golem laughed joyfully, feeling that he had already won.
</p><br><p>With such power, temporarily at the Lord Level, he would easily destroy the insolent K4-Phantom! There was no doubt about that.
</p><br><p>Mona, who was watching from the sidelines, bit her lip. She knew that since Adam had chosen the amber crystal, Bertrada had the right to make each guard strong enough that Adam would have no chance.
</p><br><p>To some extent, it was all Adam’s fault.
</p><br><p>"GRHA!" The Crystal Golem grunted, pointing at Adam.
</p><br><br><br><p>Adam was no longer there.
</p><br><p>Before the Crystal Golem could realize what was happening, his right white eye reflected a long dark coat, followed by electric discharges.
</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam plunged his sword straight into the monster’s eye when five rings connected by chains appeared on the same hand.
</p><br><p>"I don’t know who makes the decisions about your reinforcement, but that person definitely has no brain. Unlike a gargoyle, you have a weak spot, or rather two."
</p><br><br><p>The Crystal Golem’s arm lunged at Adam, trying to throw him off, but it was too late.
</p><br><p>Four rings glowed brightly, activating the ability that had ended Bathild’s life not long ago. Ironically, she, too had used someone else’s power in hopes of defeating Adam.
</p><br><p>The crimson cross ran along the blade of the sword before expanding several times and turning the Crystal Golem’s eye into a mess.
</p><br><br><p>Adam didn’t stop there.
</p><br><p>He lunged forward, ending up in the monster’s now-empty eye socket, when Silvana’s silhouette appeared next to him for a moment.
</p><br><p>Under the shocked gazes of Bertrada and Mona, the handles of a large pair of scissors appeared from the Crystal Golem’s eye socket and closed in the next instant.
</p><br><br><p>The invisible cut swept through the Crystal Golem, slicing the huge monster in two vertically.
</p><br><p>His life at the Lord Level lasted much shorter than he would have liked.
</p><br><br><p>The two halves of the stone body crashed to the ground with a thunderous roar, revealing Adam’s blood-soaked silhouette, his gaze cold and terrifying.
</p><br><p>He received no reward, but the key to the next trial hovered right in front of him, an amber orb covered in blood just like him.</p>
