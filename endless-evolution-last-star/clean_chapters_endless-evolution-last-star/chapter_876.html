            <br><p>Silvana released the first orb and the same happened at the Crystal Gates. The first orb shattered into small pieces and the first lesser gates opened, disappearing into the darkness.</p><br><p>There seemed to be no change except for the mark inside the Evolution Tree, but that was not the case, for soon a powerful stream of energy was pouring out of Adam.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze and Moira bounced back. They were allied with Adam, part of his power, but something inside them, their instincts made them fear his power.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Silvana opened her eyes.</p><br><p>Particles of white energy swept before her as she raised her head looking at the pillar of energy beaming high up, easily reaching the far darkness of space.</p><br><p>Adam looked at his hands, his eyes shining brightly like lanterns, full of power. He didn't understand what was happening, but unlike Lone Blaze or Moira, he had no reason to feel fear.</p><br><p>'How strange... It's like everything has gotten a lot slower...' Adam muttered as he looked at Silvana.</p><br><p>Her lips came into motion, but Adam had to wait an unusually long time before the first words reached his ears.</p><br><p>"Did we make it?" Silvana asked uncertainly, "I... I think I was able to destroy the first orb..."</p><br><p>Slowly, the world returned to its original speed. It was Adam's will, though he hadn't realized it yet.</p><br><p>Without saying anything, Adam looked at the first gates. They were empty now, there was nothing left of them as well as the first orb.</p><br><p>"Yeah... looks like it." Adam nodded weakly.</p><br><p>Then, he heard a voice that hadn't visited him in a long time, mechanical and deep.</p><br><p>[The first lesser gates have been opened!]</p><br><p>[The first orb has been destroyed. Your link to the Operator has reached a new level.]</p><br><p>[You and your Operator have gained access to a new ability - Stellar Resonance.]</p><br><p>"Stellar Resonance...?" Adam muttered trying to figure out what that meant.</p><br><p>Then, he turned to Silvana and took her hand firmly in his. The energy continued to flow out of him in an active stream, but it didn't bother him. He wanted to see what they were capable of now.</p><br><p>"Let's get out of here. Here..." Adam looked back at the vast darkness around him, "We won't be able to do much."</p><br><p>Silvana only nodded weakly. She had no reason to refuse.</p><br><p>In a bright flash, Adam and Silvana disappeared into the darkness, leaving Lone Blaze and Moira along with the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>[Hehehe... The first gate has been passed...]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree's short laugh rang out.</p><br><p>[Four more gates... it won't be a quick journey... but the rewards are definitely worth it...]</p><br><p>Lone Blaze looked at The Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>"Hey, you know what's behind the other gates, right?" Lone Blaze clenched her fists.</p><br><p>[Hah... maybe I do... or maybe I don't... Either way... I'm not going to tell Adam that, so you two can forget about it...]</p><br><p>After a short pause, the Evolution Tree added:</p><br><p>[More importantly... It's time for you two to return to the initial gene...]</p><br><p>Moira and Lone Blaze glanced over, uncertainty in their gazes.</p><br><p>"Pfft! What if we don't want to?" Lone Blaze snorted.</p><br><br><p>For a while, the Evolution Tree didn't say anything, but the rising tense atmosphere grew stronger and stronger.</p><br><p>This put pressure on Moira, who was unsure of their decision.</p><br><p>"Wait... Lone Blaze, maybe we should do as the tree says?"</p><br><p>"No! We're not running away anywhere, but this inner space is our home, so we can do whatever we want here!"</p><br><br><p>Lone Blaze wanted to object but the Evolution Tree beat her to it:</p><br><p>[Adam has the power to do what he wants... but not you two... sure, you're not enemies... you're both valuable allies... but it's easier for me to maintain control of the energy when you're in your place - in the initial gene...]</p><br><p>At the same moment, two beams of light emerged from the tops of the tree, falling on Moira and Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>A strange force was affecting Moira and Lone Blaze, something was forcibly pulling them towards the tree and there was no way they could resist it.</p><br><br><p>With a final Lone Blaze curse, the two girls, two entities, returned at the initial gene, filling in the missing pieces.</p><br><p>A lone pulse traveled through the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>[Good... That's much better... With Adam's power retention I don't have any problem, but...]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree has set its sights on the Crystal Gates. As long as they stand firm in the middle of the darkness, the Stellar Flow won't be able to reach the Evolution Tree.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Silvana had left the inner space too soon to notice, but a thin trickle separated from the Stellar Flow as it passed through the first gates.</p><br><p>Unlike the destructive Stellar Flow, the lone trickle did not have such great power and desire to ruin everything in its path.</p><br><p>In a way, the Crystal Gates worked as a filter. The Crystal Gates not only prevented the Stellar Flow from crashing down on the Evolution Tree but partially allowed its power to pass through.</p><br><p>However, this only happened when Adam became strong enough, otherwise, the Evolution Tree might not be able to withstand it.</p><br><p>That was the purpose of the lesser gates, besides giving Adam new abilities as a Phantom.</p><br><p>As the thin stream reached the Evolution Tree, energy began to fill every part of it.</p><br><p>After a while, a distinct cracking sound came out, as if from breaking bark, but the Evolution Tree was not damaged.</p><br><p>On the contrary, the Evolution Tree began to grow. Only a little, but it was progress in the middle of the K3-Level. When Adam was a K2-Phantom, this didn't happen.</p><br><p>[Not bad... Not bad at all... Adam will feel it soon... After all... my energy is his energy...]</p><br><br><p>[Right now, Adam has more important things to do... I'm sure he'll be overjoyed when he realizes what Silvana can do... Hah... For her... For the Operator, there's a lot ahead...]</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam and Silvana returned to the real world.</p><br><p>They opened their eyes, Adam's were the same blue as always, but Silvana's left eye shone brightly with the sign of the four-pointed star.</p><br><p>This was something new to him, something he wanted to get from Silvana.</p>
