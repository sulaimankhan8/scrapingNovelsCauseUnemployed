            <br><br><p>Standing with their backs to each other, Fromund and Adam dressed leisurely, returning to the appearance they had first arrived at the Moon Colosseum.</p><br><p>They felt fine, ten days of sleep under the care of experienced doctors was more than enough to make their wounds and fatigue go away.</p><br><p>"Hey, I don't know if I should ask, but I was just wondering."</p><br><p>Fromund uttered, putting on his boots with visible difficulty.</p><br><br><p>Adam slowly turned around, adjusting his collar.</p><br><p>"Why? What was the reason you were fighting? I gather it had something to do with that girl from the Rouzet Family. Are you lovers? I mean... You fought to save your love from the clutches of a filthy nobleman?"</p><br><p>In response, Adam's gaze grew darker, then a slight smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"Hah... I'm not sure I know what true love is, I've only been in a relationship once, and... I ended it myself. But, I'm not in love with Osana. I see her more as a cunning person and my battle buddy."</p><br><p>"I see..." Fromund nodded deeply, tying his shoes.</p><br><p>"About your question..." Adam's voice became low, "I fought at her request, I had to fulfill her wish."</p><br><p>"Hah, even though you said you didn't love her, it sounds romantic."</p><br><p>Fromund awkwardly scratched the back of his head with his usual right hand, it was perfectly reconstructed.</p><br><p>"Damn, against your reason, mine doesn't look nice at all. I fought just for money and ended up getting nothing."</p><br><br><p>Adam cast a hard look at him over his shoulder.</p><br><p>"Though we didn't know each other before this, it's obvious to everyone that money is only a consequence, the reason you fought was to protect your three younger sisters."</p><br><p>Silence fell, Fromund answered nothing his eyes only went wide.</p><br><br><p>Adam placed a hand on his shoulder, a kind smile on his face.</p><br><p>"I don't know how it is for others, but for me, it's one of the most worthy reasons to fight. In some ways I'm even ashamed that I won, though... for Osana, this victory isn't just a help - it's a chance at freedom."</p><br><br><p>Saying nothing more, they left the room, walking through the long passageway separating the employee and visitor areas, they found themselves in the main hall.</p><br><br><p>Fromund was the first to come out, causing several heads to immediately rise, looking at him with surprise and excitement.</p><br><br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda jumped up from their seats, rushing straight at Fromund like a storm, jumping on him unable to contain their emotions.</p><br><p>Adam, who appeared in the doorway a second after Fromund, had to pull back sharply so Fromund wouldn't crash into him.</p><br><br><p>Fromund took a step back, his shoulder touching the wall as he lowered his gaze, looking at the three girls who were much shorter than him.</p><br><p>"Hey, you shouldn't throw yourself at people like that, we're in a hospital... I guess." Fromund laughed briefly, patting each of them on the head.</p><br><p>A shadow walked beside the girls, causing them to turn in Adam's direction. They puffed up their cheeks, and Liv and Tilda stuck out their tongues, making faces.</p><br><p>'Agh? Why are they looking at me like that? What have I done to them?'</p><br><p>Confusion came over Adam, but soon, his eyes went wide, filling with realization.</p><br><p>'Right... Me and Fromund were enemies not long ago. Their reactions are more than normal.'</p><br><p>The girls were trying to help their brother, but all they got in response was his stern look with his arms crossed on his chest.</p><br><p>"Khm." Fromund coughed irritably, "What are you doing? Adam is no longer my opponent. He's a fighter and a strong Phantom, by disrespecting him, you're only dishonoring me!"</p><br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda flinched and lowered their heads guiltily. Fromund only smiled slightly, nodding contentedly.</p><br><p>Not being too kind and not being too strict was an art Fromund was forced to learn while raising his three sisters alone, though he had recently been a child himself, at least in age.</p><br><br><p>Adam walked forward, meeting his family.</p><br><p>"Brother!" Trici ran up to Adam, hugging him tightly.</p><br><p>Leona and Gary glanced over at each other before standing up and leisurely walking over to their son.</p><br><p>They weren't on the Moon Colosseum, Adam didn't want to get them involved, especially since he didn't even know that he would end up in the ninth ring. But... Gladius took care of that oversight on his part, and in the middle of the night, Leona and Gary got an invitation to the purple room from the demonic auctioneer.</p><br><p>After a while, Fromund glanced up, wanting to look around, then he saw Trici who was talking about something with Adam with eyes shining from excitement.</p><br><p>"Wait... Adam, you have a sister too?"</p><br><p>The shock was evident in Fromund's eyes.</p><br><p>In response, Adam only smiled slightly, ruffling Trici's hair, who had spent the last few minutes only asking questions about the fight.</p><br><p>"Oh, are you talking about that curious little devil? Hah, luckily I only have one of those, I don't know how you solo handle three at once."</p><br><p>"Hahaha." An awkward laugh escaped Fromund's lips as he shyly scratched the back of his head with a bright smile.</p><br><p>"I'm doing my best."</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Adam and Fromund turned around, realizing that someone was missing here, on either side.</p><br><p>Enjoy exclusive adventures from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Adam looked at Leona and Gary.</p><br><p>"Wait... Where's...?"</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, before Adam could speak, three silhouettes came inside - Silvana, Arayna, and Osana walking between them. They were holding hot drinks in paper cups and, talking about something, not even realizing that their Phantoms were awake.</p><br><p>Arayna stared ahead as she froze in place.</p><br><br><p>Silvana and Osana raised their eyebrows, bemused, before slowly turning their heads.</p><br><p>Their eyes went wide, meeting Adam's gaze and his slight smile.</p><br><p>For a while, Adam stared at Osana, she clenched her fists tightly, it was obvious she was nervous.</p><br><p>'Oh... Looks like it's time to make another choice. Well, what could be better than freedom? Hah...'</p>
