            <br><p>Adam and Reinz looked at each other.</p><br><p>They wanted to discuss the plan or at least decide who would attack first, but they remembered Erik's words, the rules had to be followed.</p><br><p>Julia, for her part, was in no hurry to move into action. After all, this was a 2 vs. 1, she was at a disadvantage.</p><br><p>If she attacked Reinz she would set herself up for Adam's attacks, if she charged at Adam then Reinz would take advantage of it.</p><br><br><p>Erik appeared, dropping into the seat between Silvana and Chloe.</p><br><p>"So, lady Operators." Erik reached forward, his cane hitting the ground, "Care to place a bet? Will Adam and Reinz be able to win? Maybe only one of them can stand a fight against Julia? Or... Will my lovely wife lose?"</p><br><p>Nervously, Chloe looked at him, "What will be as the bet...? I'm afraid my abilities are not what you have Mr. Erik."</p><br><p>"Hahaha." Erik laughed briefly, "Don't worry. The bets will be fair and most importantly useful. One of you who loses her bet will take over all the chores for tomorrow, i.e. cleaning and breakfast, lunch and dinner. How about that?"</p><br><p>With a hard look, Silvana took a deep breath.</p><br><p>"Fair enough. What do you say, Chloe?"</p><br><p>"Mhm... I'm betting on them winning! Reinz and Adam... they can beat Julia!"</p><br><p>With a slight smile, Erik turned to Silvana, "I hope you'll participate. Otherwise, the betting will not take place."</p><br><p>"Sure..." she replied dryly, "Adam won't win. Not this time."</p><br><p>Chloe's eyes went wide, incomprehension mixed with indignation reflected on her face.</p><br><p>"What? Silvana! Don't you believe in your Phantom? How can you bet on his defeat!"</p><br><p>With a brief pause, Silvana leaned forward, her eyes narrowed.</p><br><p>"That's not the point. I have faith in Adam, but this is a training session, not a fight to the death. The worst that can happen is defeat, the best is victory. But, if it was a matter between death and life, things would be different."</p><br><p>A sharp glint passed over her eyes.</p><br><p>"In that case, Adam wouldn't have lost. He would have killed Julia."</p><br><p>Chloe gulped, and with a face as pale as a sheet of paper she turned to look at Erik. She wanted to apologize for what Silvana just said.</p><br><p>But, all she saw was a wide grin like an old snake who had finally found a way to entertain himself.</p><br><br><p>Julia stomped on the ground raising dust.</p><br><p>"Hey, are you going to attack or not?"</p><br><p>However, her taunt didn't work. Adam and Reinz wanted to win, but they didn't understand how they should do it when they couldn't even talk to each other.</p><br><p>Suddenly, Adam looked at Julia, addressing her.</p><br><p>"I'm curious about one thing, this armor..." he pointed at Julia, "Is it yours or did Erik create it when he touched your shoulder?"</p><br><p>They were forbidden to talk to each other, but Adam could talk to his opponent.</p><br><p>Gradually, everyone realized it, including Reinz.</p><br><p>"It's..." Julia stammered.</p><br><p>Before she could answer, Adam waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Never mind, I want to tell you something else," he leaned his body forward, channeling energy to his hands, "I'll attack in three seconds, be ready."</p><br><p>Julia's eyes went wide as she looked at Erik. She wanted to say that it was a violation of the rules, but... Erik's slight smile showed that he wasn't going to interfere.</p><br><p>Then, Reinz's eyes sparkled, energy surging through his entire body.</p><br><p>'I see... We don't have to talk. We won't be able to discuss the plan speaking with Julia, but... that's more than enough.'</p><br><p>"Three... Two... One..."</p><br><br><p>As soon as Adam's words were spoken he and Reinz turned into two flashes. They simultaneously appeared next to Julia, attacking her from both sides.</p><br><p>No one used any abilities, just energy and pure physical power. Adam and Reinz thought that this way they would better understand how strong their opponent was.</p><br><p>After all, neither of them had ever fought against an Operator before. It was something new and unknown, especially when it was Erik's Operator.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, staring intently at Julia, his fist carried towards her.</p><br><p>'Apparently, Erik is a Second Rank Phantom, I can't be sure about that, but I doubt he's a K4-Phantom. He was stronger than the Alderran Family elders, and they're much stronger than me and Reinz.</p><br><p>'So... Following these simple thoughts. Right now, my opponent is the Operator of the Second Rank Phantom. At some point... Silvana will reach that level as well. I'm sure of it.'</p><br><p>It's unknown what Reinz was thinking, but there was no more time for that.</p><br><br><p>Julia stepped forward, letting two fists pass over her shoulders.</p><br><p>Reinz and Adam quickly grouped up, their bodies turning at the same time as their legs came down on Julia's face like whips.</p><br><p>But, no sooner had they reached their goal than Julia grabbed their ankles firmly, with such force that their bones were ready to crack.</p><br><p>Then, with cold eyes, Julia effortlessly lifted them, in one sharp motion crashing them to the ground like puppets.</p><br><br><p>A painful groan rang out, drops of blood gushing from their ajar mouths. The ground was far more solid than each of them had expected, filled with energy brought from the far parts of the Wild Lands.</p><br><p>Like a ghost, Julia found herself between them, "You are too weak to hope to defeat me without ability. I'll forgive you this time, but... next time I won't hold back."</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz glanced over, Julia was in a vulnerable position. Their backs lifted slightly off the ground, their hands discreetly reaching out to her legs.</p><br><p>Well, at least it seemed that way to them.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, two crystal tails emerged from Julia's lower back, long shadows falling across Reinz and Adam's shocked faces.</p><br><p>Then, the tails descended onto their stomachs, folding the two young men almost in two from the force of the impact.</p><br><p>Adam reached upward wanting to reach for Julia.</p><br><p>But, the last thing he saw was the cruel tail coming down on his face, with a loud crunch echoing through the arena.</p>
