            <br><p>Gearing up to fight the lizards, Risha gripped the ring tightly, shattering the crystal locked inside. Bright light reflected in the cave walls, the energy taking the form of a massive weapon - an axe that was almost as big as Risha herself.</p><br><p>Despite teasing Risha, Adam watched carefully as the strange ring worked.</p><br><p>'Hmm... It all happened too fast last time. Moreover, I wasn't prepared to see Nexuses appear simply out of air. It's handy, fast, and effective,' Adam pondered as Risha took the first swing throwing the lizards aside.</p><br><p>'However...' his eyes narrowed. 'That sounds too good to be true. If this strange ring had no drawbacks, the Phantoms at the Upper Ring would be using this instead of heavy and uncomfortable cases.'</p><br><p>Not all Phantoms had small Nexus like Adam's. At first, it was gloves, then gauntlets, and eventually, it became two rings that he never took off. His weapon was always with him at all times when he needed it.</p><br><p>Other Phantoms weren't so lucky. Some had short blades that fit on their belts, while others had massive swords the size of great warriors. Risha was no exception, her weapon could not be called small.</p><br><p>Then, a crystal appeared in Adam's mind, the core of the ring.</p><br><p>'Though, it could be all about that crystal, right? But, is there some resource at the Lower Ring that is not available to the Upper Ring? All you have to do is mine the resource and bring it to the Upper Ring, right?'</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>'Fine, I'll ask her about that later. Right now I should enjoy the show.'</p><br><p>Without even a thought of helping Risha, Adam put his hands together, watching Risha fight like he was in a movie theater.</p><br><br><p>The broad blade of the axe sliced through the first lizard, forcing the second to temporarily retreat. However, the lizards weren't going to run away, they had a number advantage and they knew they had a chance to win.</p><br><p>With an irritated hiss, several lizards simultaneously charged at Risha. The dark bodies of the monsters completely blocked her like a pack of hounds ready to tear her apart.</p><br><p>"Bastards! Get away from me!"</p><br><p>With a furious shout, a crimson blast threw the lizards aside. The beast's long paws woven from energy became gauntlets for Risha, covering her arms from elbows to fingertips.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment. He remembered Risha using a similar ability against him, but this was something more complete.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>In a tight grip, Risha channeled energy to her axe, causing her weapon to tremble. The next moment, she turned into a spinning disk, collapsing on the lizards one by one.</p><br><p>The first three decided they could resist her, yet a single blast was enough to tear the lizard into bloody shards. Their tough armor was a problem for the other K3-Phantoms, but not for RIsha.</p><br><p>Then, the lizards tried to run away, but Risha was not going to stop. She only got faster and the blasts gained power with each new victim.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam was genuinely impressed.</p><br><p>'Wow, that doesn't sound like an ability. I mean... Obviously, it's an ability, but she can execute a string of attacks like that through training, I'm sure of it.'</p><br><p>In the end, there was only one opponent left against Risha the Prime Obsidian Lizard.</p><br><p>The S3 monster didn't try to run away, even though a crimson disk that resembled the force of a meteor crashed toward it.</p><br><p>Throwing a quick glance at Adam, the prime lizard pressed itself against the ground, channeling energy to its back. Flames traveled along the cracks in its stone scales, creating a protective barrier.</p><br><p>"Tsk! That won't help you!" Risha exclaimed, clutching her axe tighter with both hands.</p><br><p>But, of the two of them, the right one turned out to be a lizard.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The rings of flame spread apart, taking away the impact of the Risha's strike. Several tiny shards broke away from the scales, flying in front of Risha's horrified eyes.</p><br><p>That was all the damage she could do to the S3 monster.</p><br><p>Before she could react, a long tail plunged into her stomach, hard as mace. The hit threw her aside in a projectile, breaking through several stone peaks, sinking beneath the debris in a cloud of dust.</p><br><br><p>The prime lizard tore forward without slowing its pace, but Risha was quick to recover. With a swing of her axe, she sent a crimson blade towards the lizard, forcing it to retreat.</p><br><p>But, these were temporary measures. She needed to find a way to win and she didn't see it, yet.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."</p><br><p>Risha's heavy breathing muffled the clots of blood falling to the ground from her mouth. It seemed like the prime lizard had only struck once, but Risha didn't have time to react and defend herself.</p><br><p>Watching the consequences of one mistake, Adam nodded understandingly.</p><br><p>'If you're a K3-Phantom, at some point you have to master the Full Energy Control. You don't always have the option of using an ability or weapon to defend yourself, but the energy is with you at all times.'</p><br><p>Then, he looked at Risha who was holding onto her stomach trying to take away the vivid pain.</p><br><p>'If Phantom was a bit more experienced, he would have used the Inner Energy Control and reinforced the spot seconds before it happened.'</p><br><p>It seemed Adam had to wonder if he could pull it off, but then he wasn't thinking of himself.</p><br><p>"Hey!" Adam waved his hand drawing Risha's attention. "If you want I can help you! But for that, you have to stop acting like a piece of shit!"</p><br><p>All Adam got was Risha's furious glare.</p><br><p>She spat out a clot of blood, clutching the axe tighter. "Shut up, I can handle an S3 monster! It wouldn't be the first opponent of that strength for me."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly looking at the lizard.</p><br><p>'Well... If you don't have a trump card, this simple-looking lizard will just tear you apart.'</p><br><p>'It happened back at the K2-Level, but it's only now in full force.'</p><br><p>His eyes grew deeper.</p><br><p>'The fights have gotten a lot faster. One more missed strike and Risha will just fall to the ground.'</p>
