            <br><br><p>The black blade pierced deep into the lizard's chest, coming out the back side and plunging straight into the wall.</p><br><p>Silvana's hand moved towards the monster's neck, clutching it tightly with all her strength, effortlessly breaking the fragile bones.</p><br><p>It was the 20th Obsidian Lizard since they had entered the cave. Random purple crystals were their only source of light.</p><br><p>So far no other enemies or dangers had appeared, everything was according to their information.</p><br><p>Stopping at a ledge leading sharply downward, Silvana heard the voice of her Operator:</p><br><p>'Good, move along. This is a multi-level cave. You will have to go down to the fourth or fifth level to meet the main monster. In fact, we don't know how many levels there are; we probably only know of three,' Adam calmly said.</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"I see. Well, we killed half a hundred monsters and none of them even managed to injure us, so we'll easily accomplish the mission. I'm sure of it."</p><br><br><p>Abel and Talna came up from behind. There were a few Obsidian Lizards in front of the ledge, but Silvana killed them all in a few seconds. Abel's defenses were not needed for now, nor were Talna's abilities. She stood in the distance, watching as Abel and Silvana destroyed the lizards one by one.</p><br><p>Abel glanced at Silvana. They had no clear leader, but her job was to destroy the monsters.</p><br><br><p>"Yes, but we will do everything by the book, no mistakes will be tolerated. Abel, go ahead and stay near the wall in case you get surrounded. Then I'll join you, especially if I see opponents from above." Silvana said sternly while clutching her swords tightly.</p><br><p>Without further ado, Abel shrugged and jumped down. His massive silhouette flew a few meters before reaching the cold ground, a light rumble dispersed around raising a cloud of dust.</p><br><p>Just as Silvana had said, Abel immediately bounced back, his back touching the cold wall, a shield of golden energy was in front of him, protecting him from any onslaughts.</p><br><p>Soon, everyone heard his Operator's voice:</p><br><p>'Guys... Looks like it's clear.'</p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes, peering into the darkness. The light from the crystals wasn't bright enough to see anything.</p><br><p>Enjoy new adventures from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a purple glow appeared out of the darkness, but it wasn't the monster's eyes, it was something bigger, much brighter.</p><br><p>Realizing the gravity of the situation, Silvana immediately jumped down, going to help Abel in case of danger. There were only three of them, so if any of them were injured too badly and unable to continue fighting, their mission would be doomed to failure.</p><br><p>Before Silvana could reach the ground, a long spear with a curved tip rushed towards Abel.</p><br><p>As the spear collided with his shield, cascades of sparks flew off to the side, a shudder ran across the amber surface, Abel's face frowned and the muscles in his arm trembled with the force of the attack.</p><br><p>However, he succeeded in his task, the spear stopping just short of breaking through his defense.</p><br><br><p>Two dark blades appeared from above, closing around the hilt of the spear, intent on destroying the weapon once and for all.</p><br><p>At the last moment, the spear trembled, returning to its owner at high speed, the black blades slicing through nothing but air.</p><br><p>Not upset by the failure, Silvana landed next to Abel, assuming a fighting stance. Talna remained on the ledge, watching them from a safe distance.</p><br><p>"Is that an Obsidian Lizard? Neither of them had weapons before, just claws..." Silvana narrowed her eyes peering into the darkness.</p><br><br><p>A few steps later, a tall, three-meter tall silhouette emerged from the darkness, its body much larger than Abel's despite its lean build.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide for a moment.</p><br><p>Standing in the middle of the passageway was the Obsidian Lizard, or rather its enhanced version. The monster looked almost identical to its younger fellows, but it was much taller, wielded a massive spear, and had a large purple crystal in its chest.</p><br><p>'Oh, I thought you wouldn't meet them until later, but it looks like one of them decided to make a trap for you.' Adam calmly said seeing the same thing Silvana did.</p><br><p>"Who the fuck is that bastard? He looks a lot stronger... Is it a Prime Type?" Silvana suggested narrowing her eyes.</p><br><p>'No. It's an Elite Obsidian Lizard, since Prime Obsidian Lizards are different, though it's unlikely you'll meet them, they're very rare guests.'</p><br><p>Realizing the seriousness of the situation, Silvana nodded and prepared for battle.</p><br><p>"Abel, be ready to defend me if I make a mistake." Silvana said calmly before stepping forward, standing in front of Abel.</p><br><p>His eyes ran from side to side, he wished Silvana was behind him so that his shield would protect them both, but in the end, he just nodded.</p><br><p>With a cold stare, Silvana crossed the black blades in front of her, her green eyes shining in the darkness like gems.</p><br><p>The Elite Obsidian Lizard hissed irritably but did not back down. He came here to deal with the intruders.</p><br><p>The monster stepped forward, pointed its heavy spear at Silvana as its purple crystal shone brightly, filling the monster's body with energy.</p><br><br><p>"You advised me not to use anything serious against Obsidian Lizards, but... it's a higher difficulty level opponent, isn't it?"</p><br><p>The answer followed immediately:</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Purple streams of energy coming out of the crystal, covered the lizard's chest, heading towards the long spear like flows of water. A few more moments and the Elite Obsidian Lizard would be ready to unleash its most powerful attack.</p><br><p>"In that case, there's no point in me wasting much time on him."</p><br><p>A black mist emanated from Silvana's body, merging with the darkness surrounding them, quickly saturating her blades ready to fulfill their purpose.</p><br><br><p>Silvana's foot touched the ground, tilting her torso slightly forward, her hands gripping the handles tightly.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, like a vengeful spirit, Silvana found herself behind an Elite Obsidian Lizard who didn't even have time to realize what had happened.</p><br><br><p>Dozens of bloody lines appeared on the monster's body, the blood was about to flow out, but not in time.</p><br><p>The monster's body exploded into small pieces, shards of flesh flying off to the sides, crashing into the walls.</p><br><p>"First one ready..." Silvana exhaled a cold vapor, knocking the dark blood off her swords.</p>
