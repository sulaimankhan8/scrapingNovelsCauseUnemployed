            <br><p>Pain and wide cuts were all that awaited Giselle.</p><br><p>Adam proved to be faster and stronger, in every aspect of their fast and fierce battle.</p><br><br><p>Giselle didn't give it a second thought before the fight began. She wasn't going to give up in any way.</p><br><p>She was trying to figure out how to defeat Adam, adjust her fighting style to him, and use her strengths to overwhelm him.</p><br><p>Yet, even though she didn't realize it yet, Giselle couldn't even hurt Adam.</p><br><p>'No... How could this happen?'</p><br><p>Giselle's lost look was reflected in the wide splashes of blood whipping from her chest.</p><br><p>'It can't be. Our powers aren't that much different.'</p><br><p>A cold wave ran through her entire body as their eyes met - one last time as duelists.</p><br><p>'You... Did you just get lucky? None of my decisions have brought me any closer to victory. Why...?'</p><br><br><p>Then, Giselle reached the ground. Her back slammed into the hard surface, causing her to gasp in pain once more.</p><br><p>The blood flowing from her numerous wounds quickly formed a crimson puddle beneath her, growing wider with each of her heavy breaths.</p><br><br><p>Adam took a step forward, his shoe sinking into the thin layer of blood.</p><br><p>He stared at her silently for a while, seeing only incomprehension in her eyes. There was no fear, nor Giselle's usual pride - she just wanted to know what she did wrong.</p><br><p>Her facial expression seemed to scream one question:</p><br><p>'How...? How was I supposed to win?'</p><br><p>However, Adam wasn't going to give her answers, his job was merely to win. He managed it without difficulty.</p><br><p>Turning around, Adam spoke in a deep voice:</p><br><p>"Don't get up, I'm sure help will come soon. And... one more thing."</p><br><p>Giselle held her breath, waiting for his next words.</p><br><p>"If you weren't ready to die, you shouldn't have demanded such a promise from me. Now, I feel shitty."</p><br><p>Then, he turned his blue eyes, two bright stars casting a glare at Giselle over his shoulder.</p><br><p>"Next time - I'll kill you. I won't hold back."</p><br><p>Leaving Giselle in even more shock than she was originally, Adam headed forward to observer no. 3.</p><br><p>As soon as he stepped away from Giselle, whispers broke out among the crowd, the active discussions would not subside for a long time.</p><br><p>The blond-haired man smiled slyly, raising his right hand in the air. His fist was tightly clenched, holding two coins at once.</p><br><p>Stopping in front of him, Adam jerked his head toward Giselle.</p><br><p>"That's enough to end the fight, right?"</p><br><p>The man nodded, not delaying his answer.</p><br><p>"Sure, you put on a first-class show Mr. Adam. Too bad Giselle couldn't get you to fight to your full potential. That would be quite the show."</p><br><p>With a deft movement, the blond-haired man opened his fist, tossing two twilight coins to Adam.</p><br><p>He deftly caught the coins.</p><br><br><p>Adam sighed heavily as he looked at the result of his victory.</p><br><p>"Despite everything that happened here, I'm just back to the beginning. I guess giving up in the first fight was a mistake."</p><br><p>"Well..." the man chuckled, "It was your decision. Who knows, maybe you could have found two more fools willing to take the easy win."</p><br><p>Then, the observer glanced at Adam's coins.</p><br><p>"However, things will change for you now. I'm sure after your victory over Giselle, there will be plenty of nobles willing to fight against you."</p><br><p>He lifted his chin, looking at Adam with narrowed eyes.</p><br><p>"Two victories? Hah, you will achieve that in a matter of days. I doubt you'll lose again unless it's your will."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly and approached Silvana. She greeted him with a slight smile.</p><br><p>"Congratulations, that was a great fight, and..." her eyes ran over Adam's coat, "Your new ability. It seems you managed to take something with you from the Crimson Monarch after all."</p><br><p>Adam's corners of his mouth went up, forming a bitter grimace.</p><br><p>"Yeah, I guess you're right."</p><br><p>Saying nothing more, Adam gently took Silvana's hand and headed forward, along the passageway under the observer's curious gaze.</p><br><p>None of the nobles dared to approach him, there was no need.</p><br><p>Right now, they were spectators and Adam was one of the fighters.</p><br><p>He won and Giselle lost.</p><br><p>Nothing else mattered. The nobles only had to discuss the sensation and come to some conclusions.</p><br><p>Obviously, it couldn't be good for Giselle.</p><br><p>She could choose any opponent and leave the Twilight Palace with a perfect score, yet she chose a different path - she probably regretted it.</p><br><p>The rumors didn't bother Adam much.</p><br><p>From his very first day as the Phantom, he was discussed in the ranks of the military, then after his first fights he began to gain fame among the common people and eventually performed at the Moon Colosseum.</p><br><p>As it turned out, it was not enough for all the nobles of the younger generation to know about him, but that was not his goal.</p><br><p>Now, even the young nobles, the talents from the first wing who reached a K3-Level, realized that he was no ordinary Phantom.</p><br><br><p>In a serene stride, Adam and Silvana were moving away from the Amber Cloud. A few more steps and they disappeared around the corner.</p><br><p>Suddenly, a silhouette emerged from the crowd, moving towards them with clear intentions.</p><br><p>The observer no. 3, smirked insidiously as he licked his lips.</p><br><p>"Hah, how interesting."</p><br><p>Then, behind Adam and Silvana came an irritated, verging-on violent cry.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter! Stop! How... How dare you do this to Ms. Giselle!? To a high noble!?"</p><br><p>Without any emotion on his face, Adam turned around seeing a girl of average height.</p><br><p>Like the others, she was one of the nobles, the high one.</p><br><p>The girl had jaw-short, unusual green hair and the same color eyes, bright and toxic as if they couldn't be natural.</p><br><p>However, as it always was in these situations, it was the hallmark of one of the Twelve Branches - the Xeron Family.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, the girl dressed in the white vest couldn't scare him despite her menacing stare and creepy grimace.</p><br><p>"What do you want, kid?"</p>
