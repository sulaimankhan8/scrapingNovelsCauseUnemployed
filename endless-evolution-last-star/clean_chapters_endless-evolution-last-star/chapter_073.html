            <br><p>Soon, Adam, Artan, and Silvana found themselves in front of various buildings that spread over a rather large area in this region of the Third Ring.</p><br><p>This area was specifically designated for the P35 Preparatory Academy. Preparatory academies were always located near military bases and branches of the missions department and research department.</p><br><p>Everything needed to be close by so that the week-long training could be as efficient and extensive as possible in a short period.</p><br><br><p>Heading down the tall corridor, they passed many teachers who nodded at the sight of Artan, showing their respect.</p><br><p>Then, they entered the hall with dozens of people waiting for them.</p><br><p>All of them had already awakened Spark a few days ago, so this class was specifically for future Phantoms, not for those who hoped to become them.</p><br><p>Silvana sat at the back of the classroom, and Adam sat in the front row, next to another Phantom that Artan had invited. He was a young man with a confident grin and short black hair. His aura was weaker than Adam's, as he was a K0 Phantom.</p><br><p>Artan started the lecture - mostly he talked about how important the Phantoms were, the seriousness of their future position in this world, some statistics, and such stuff.</p><br><p>Soon, it was time for the most interesting part - interacting with the real Phantoms.</p><br><p>"Hah, I know all the seats are taken today because this is a special lecture, and you've waited for what you came here for!" Artan exclaimed vigorously as he waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Adam, Kody, come on stage with me!"</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Kody quickly rose and headed towards Artan, it seemed that he had been waiting for this moment since the beginning - more than the students.</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly and followed him.</p><br><p>At first, all the students' attention was focused on Kody, because he was the Phantom - what they were fated to become in the near future.</p><br><p>However, when Adam appeared, there were whispers throughout the audience, some students seemed to recognize him.</p><br><p>"Alright! While we still have time, you have the opportunity to ask the Phantoms the questions that bother you the most!" Artan uttered, then he pointed to the center of the audience at a short girl with glasses.</p><br><p>"You, ask the question first. You've been looking at them instead of me since the beginning, so I'm sure you have something to ask." Artan said confidently.</p><br><p>The girl gulped, she was worried, it was obvious.</p><br><p>"Hey, don't be shy. I'm ready to hear you out!" Kody smiled, stepping forward.</p><br><p>"Sure..." The girl muttered, "In that case... Tell me about Dead Lands. Is this place really as dangerous as they say it is?"</p><br><br><p>Everyone wanted to hear the answer because their lives could depend on it - this was important knowledge. Sure, the academy would tell them about Dead Lands in great detail, but hearing it from Phantom was a different matter.</p><br><p>"Nah." Kody replied quickly with a wave of his hand.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"In Dead Lands, you will face monsters, but you will win because you will always have your mates and Operators with you. Moreover, the departments and military will always be able to help you."</p><br><p>Then, someone raised a hand, Kody smiled and pointed at that young man.</p><br><p>"Monsters! What can you say about them?"</p><br><br><p>"Like I said earlier, there's no need to worry about it. The Mission Department will always give you all the information you need. Your job will be to arrive at the point - kill the monsters you know beforehand and return home."</p><br><p>Then, Kody continued answering questions, taking all the attention for himself. </p><br><p>At the same time, Adam's patience was starting to run out, but not because no one was asking him.</p><br><p>'Fuck... What is that idiot talking about?! He talks like being a Phantom is an easy job, almost a forever vacation that gets paid extra!' Adam inwardly exclaimed, completely outraged by what was happening.</p><br><br><p>Adam put a hand on Kody's shoulder with a great grimace.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Kody gave him a puzzled look, "Hey, sorry for taking all the glory for yourself, but they made their own choices. You can only blame yourself for being so boring!"</p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"That's not the point. Tell me, have you ever been on missions once? How many times have you fought in Dead Lands?"</p><br><p>Kody went pale for a moment, but he quickly regained his composure and confidently poked himself in the chest with his thumb.</p><br><p>"Of course, I am! I'm sure I have a lot more experience than you! Newbie, you shouldn't try to hurt my feelings, for I know how to behave in Dead Lands."</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head with a deep gaze.</p><br><p>Apparently, Kody didn't recognize or know Adam, unlike some of the students. It wasn't surprising, since out of all the Phantoms, only a small fraction had seen Adam's accomplishments.</p><br><p>"Maybe some Phantoms think Dead Lands is a dangerous place, but only unskilled idiots can think that! Hahaha!" Kody waved his hand arrogantly, trying not to get out of character.</p><br><p>Adam's veins swelled as he clenched his fists tightly, but Kody didn't notice it - continuing to play the part.</p><br><p>"Phantoms die from monsters, but it's their fault. They're probably either cowards or weaklings who didn't listen to the mission department and decided to do things their way. I generally think that...</p><br><br><p>Adam's fist came down on Kody's face before he could finish his disgusting speech.</p><br><p>Adam didn't hold back, he attacked full force, so considering that Kody was K0, the impact threw him back a few meters, making him collide with the wall at high speed.</p><br><p>No one dared to make a sound, no whispers, no talking, no questions, it was all over.</p><br><p>Everyone looked at Adam, expecting something from him. Perhaps an explanation, an apology, or maybe something else.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry, I have to leave after that, but..." Adam uttered, heading towards the exit. The eyes of the students followed his every move.</p><br><p>"You should know that everything Kody has told you is a lie. Dead Lands is a dangerous place where only blood, pain, and death await you.</p><br><p>Cruel monsters, anomalies, and bad luck will haunt you in hopes of ending your existence. Departments sometimes make mistakes, and so do people, and also... somedays one monster attack is enough to make a whole squad of dozens of people nothing left."</p><br><p>With those words, Adam stepped out into the hallway.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, those words were enough to override everything Kody had said before, for Adam was sincere, and everyone could feel it. Perhaps the blow to Kody's face had added credibility, but it didn't matter, since the students got the valuable experience, they had come here for.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a door opened at the far end of the hallway. A tall girl with long black hair and calm blue eyes stepped out of the room. She, like Kody, was a K0 Phantom and had come here to answer the students' questions.</p><br><p>It was nothing out of the ordinary.</p><br><p>However, as soon as Adam saw this girl his eyes went wide, and dark feelings immediately filled his soul because this was Lana Tiates - the only one who had Spark during Aiden Henk's test at Morton Observatory.</p><br><br><p>Driven by emotion, Adam lunged forward, grabbing Lana by the arm and pinning her against the wall before she could realize anything.</p><br><p>He was going to find out everything about Aiden Henk from her if a pawn like her had any information.</p>
