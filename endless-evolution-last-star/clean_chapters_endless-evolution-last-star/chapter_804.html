            <br><p>The Crimson Monarch's eyes went wide. His serpent's gaze was his unique trump card not related to thunder or blood, it was a sudden attack against which there was no defense.</p><br><p>True, it didn't have the expected effect against Adam. His energy control acted driven by instincts, completely protecting him from weak monsters. However, this was the Crimson Monarch's mistake. If he had attacked Adam immediately with his powerful attack, the victory would have already been his.</p><br><p>But... it didn't affect Katrin for more than a second. Her scythe absorbed the unusual ability onto itself, and its energy ran along the blade accumulating power.</p><br><p>Katrin glanced at the blade, her eyes growing deeper.</p><br><p>"Not sure exactly what's going on here, but..." she turned to the Crimson Monarch, "I'll make you regret your words. You arrogant bastard."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Her time was coming to an end. Even if the scythe absorbed the Crimson Monarch's curse upon itself, it was only a temporary process.</p><br><p>Without further ado, Katrin tore forward, raising the scythe high above her head.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's eyes narrowed, he bounced back while electrical discharges condensed at his hands.</p><br><p>With eyes wide open, Katrin swung the scythe from top to bottom, releasing all the energy from the blade at once.</p><br><p>A devastating black slash appeared in the blink of an eye, splitting the ground like an unstoppable force. The trembling edges of darkness scattered waves of sand to the sides, exposing the cold earth - this time, even the surface could not escape the consequences.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat before the direct collision, the Crimson Monarch swung his hands, creating five pulsating orbs. At his will, the orbs took the shape of a pentagon, becoming his electric shield.</p><br><p>Red sparks reflected in his eyes, hoping to take on the full force of Katrin's anger.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A shudder ran through the ground, electric shocks raining down on the ground running from the terrifying dark energy, weakening the Crimson Monarch's shield all the more.</p><br><p>Trying to take advantage of even this risky situation, the Crimson Monarch thrust his arm forward, he was ready to shoot Katrin with thunder ray as soon as the dark blade and shield destroyed each other.</p><br><br><p>With a gust of wind, a calm silhouette appeared beside the Crimson Monarch. It wasn't Katrin, he would feel her anger bubbling like flames.</p><br><p>In a split second, the Crimson Monarch turned, Adam reflected in his eyes. The purple streams ran along his fist, muscles trembling as if ready to explode at any moment, veins throbbing with impending menace, impatience reaching its limit.</p><br><p>With a loud crunch, his fist slammed into the Crimson Monarch's face from the right side, with a thud following the air ring, a series of waves traveled across the Crimson Monarch's face.</p><br><p>The jaw came out of the puzzle, cracks running along the underside, shattering half of it into fragile splinters embedded in the inner flesh.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's eyes rolled sideways with difficulty as they flew out of their orbits, a torrent of blood rushed from his nose under the pressure, casting a shadow across his shocked face.</p><br><p>Then, the momentum reached his body, abruptly spinning his head almost a full turn. Had it not been for the incredibly strong muscles of his neck and shoulders, Adam's punch would have knocked his head like a ball, leaving only a decapitated body.</p><br><p>This time even the Crimson Monarch couldn't stay still, the impact threw him aside, waves of sand rising towards him like an explosion.</p><br><br><p>Like a smooth stone thrown onto the surface of a lake, the Crimson Monarch's body bounced off the surface, getting rougher and rougher as his speed decreased.</p><br><p>A pillar of snow soared upward, falling on the Crimson Monarch already submerged beneath the layer of sand.</p><br><p>Jets of hot steam escaped from Adam's fist, heated by the flaming bracelet given to him by his temporary ally.</p><br><p>Katrin, who had hoped to defeat the Crimson Monarch with her powerful attack, was at a loss. Her eyes were wide open, looking forward.</p><br><p>Deep inside, she hoped that the Crimson Monarch would rise sharply now, but... there was nothing to indicate that, only the wind fluttering the grains of sand on the hill.</p><br><br><p>Adam clenched his fist tightly and unclenched it, his fingers trembling, but he was fine. It would take too long to recover.</p><br><p>"Fuck!" Katrin exclaimed, taking a fighting stance, "We have to finish him off! Right now!"</p><br><p>Before her words could reach Adam's ears, she dashed forward like a shadow over the Crimson Monarch's hill.</p><br><p>The next instant she swung her scythe, a gleam running down the curved blade.</p><br><br><p>The thunder ray flew out of the depths like a bullet piercing her left shoulder. A surge of blood rushed before her eyes, but...</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Katrin clenched her teeth with a blank stare, bringing her weapon down on the Crimson Monarch buried under the sand. She didn't care about pain anymore - defeating someone so majestic was more important.</p><br><p>A layer of sand moved aside, revealing the Crimson Monarch's silhouette.</p><br><p>His hand clutched the tip of the black blade tightly, blood trickling along his palm, falling onto his chest, only a few centimeters from his heart. His face twisted with strain, even though his attack was successful it didn't stop Katrin.</p><br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's hoarse voice rumbled, full of cruelty and irritation.</p><br><p>"You humans... Your women are always nothing but trouble, especially one... You never know when you've already exceeded your limits!"</p><br><p>With a fiery shout, the Crimson Monarch rose abruptly from the ground. Katrin reacted by changing the grip of her scythe, the black blade leaving a wide cut on the Crimson Monarch's chest.</p><br><p>For a moment she lost concentration thinking about the Crimson Monarch's words. The first thing she thought was that he was trying to insult her, but...</p><br><p>'No... For all my hatred of monsters, the Crimson Monarch is not the case. This isn't an attempt to insult me... this is his genuine resentment... what woman is he talking about?'</p><br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's claws appeared in front of her, stopped by the long hilt of her new Nexus.</p><br><p>At the same moment, behind the Crimson Monarch appeared Adam, something about him changed. His rings were no longer coated in red energy, replaced by a calm, purple flame.</p>
