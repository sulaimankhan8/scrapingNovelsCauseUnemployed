            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1185: Flight Attempt</strong></p><br><p>In this world, there was no one more loyal than insects whose colonies were threatened by something or someone.</p><br><p>Even if a person had an impeccable reputation and another person had known them for decades, it was rare for the latter to be certain that the former would be willing to give their life for them without hesitation.</p><br><p>However, the Kirani Guards, like all Kirani Bugs, had no such thoughts. No one had any doubts that, if necessary, an ant would die so that the colony could live on, because the colony depended on it, and it depended on the colony.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, even such loyalty did not mean that they were protected from external invaders.</p><br><p>One way or another, the only thing that ultimately mattered was power.</p><br><br><p>Fromund cracked his knuckles, preparing for battle.</p><br><p>The Kirani Guards moved quickly, but they had little time to discuss a plan of action.</p><br><p>“What are we going to do? If you want to relax, I can take three of them and give you a chance to have a 1-on-1 fight like you like!”</p><br><p>Adam rolled his eyes.</p><br><p>“Come on, you still think I beat you just because the conditions were more favorable for me?”</p><br><p>“Nah, it’s more complicated than that.” Fromund shook his head. “If I thought that, I wouldn’t have admitted defeat. Hahaha, don’t forget that it was my decision, not yours!”</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand as he touched his temples. He couldn’t listen to this anymore.</p><br><p>“Just take two each and that’s it, no need to complicate things, okay?”</p><br><p>“Fine, whatever you say.” Fromund shrugged.</p><br><p>At the same moment, four shadows fell upon them.</p><br><p>Their conversation didn’t last long, but it was enough for the Kirani Guards to reach them. The guards were ready to attack, their fists clenched tightly, ready to end it all with one strike.</p><br><p>However, they made a serious mistake, deciding that Adam and Fromund’s calm auras reflected their peak power.</p><br><br><p>Their frames shook as Adam and Fromund disappeared a moment before the strike.</p><br><p>A stream of soot gushed upward as the Kirani Guards’ eyes darted in different directions. They realized that their first attack had failed, so they immediately began searching for their enemies.</p><br><p>At the same time, something touched each of the guards’ shoulders.</p><br><p>They turned around and thrust their lances forward, but Adam and Fromund were faster. They knocked the guards back before lunging at the bugs while they were still in the air.</p><br><p>The guards tried to regain their balance by spreading their wings, but they underestimated how fast their opponents were.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Fromund’s fists slammed into their stomachs, throwing the Kirani Guards in different directions. With this move, they divided the battlefield into two arenas.</p><br><br><p>With a carefree stride, Adam approached the two Kirani Guards who were already hovering above the ground. Their wings moved quickly, sweeping away a layer of ash and exposing the dark earth, but their eyes were fixed on the Phantom in front of them.</p><br><p>Sure, like any insect monsters, they were physically strong, but they had few or no abilities. When the enemy was faster and stronger than they were, their options were severely limited.</p><br><p>“Alright, let’s get this over with quickly. I want to see how Fromund handles his part.” Adam said carelessly as he glanced over his shoulder.</p><br><p>Splashes of flame emanated from every clash between Fromund and the Kirani Guards. They had already begun and were actively fighting each other, unlike Adam, who, despite his words, was in no hurry.</p><br><p>CRISK! CRISK! CRISK!</p><br><p>However, he received no answer, only the crack of jaws.</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam tilted his head in confusion. “So you’re not the Awakened Monsters? Damn, I knew that an anthropomorphic physique was no guarantee that you could speak even at the Black Threat Level, but… this is strange.”</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam’s expression became more serious.</p><br><p>He had expected the Kirani Guards to be among the strongest monsters at the Kirani Colony, with only one or two monsters stronger than them, but now he no longer believed that.</p><br><p>‘Hmm. If the Twilight Crystals are hidden in their colony and they haven’t lost them yet, then there must be several Lesser Elders or Elders there. At the same time, the monsters they put to guard the passage aren’t even the Awakened Ones.’</p><br><p>Adam glared at the Kirani Guards.</p><br><p>‘They’re pretty strong, I can feel it in their auras. F2 Black Threat Level at least, but they’re not as strong as Kolos or Dayra, even though they were the Lesser Elders.’</p><br><p>Then, five rings connected by chains covered his right arm. For something as simple as two Kirani Guards, one active ring was enough.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward as his aura became significantly more powerful.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a tremor ran through the Kirani Guards as they scattered in different directions, anticipating Adam’s attack.</p><br><p>In a split second, he was between them as his hand grabbed the ankle of one of them.</p><br><p>Adam clenched his fist tightly, preparing to attack, as the Kirani Guard couldn’t escape his grip.</p><br><p>One attack from his Nexus would be enough to end the guard’s life.</p><br><p>Unfortunately for Adam, he wasn’t the only one who understood this.</p><br><p>The second Kirani Guard threw his spear forward, aiming straight for Adam’s heart.</p><br><p>“Tsk.” Adam frowned as he let go of the monster’s ankle to dodge the lance.</p><br><p>Without hesitation, the first Kirani Guard picked up his mate’s lance and threw it straight at Adam, who had not yet managed to get back on his feet.</p><br><p>If another Phantom had been in his place, he would have had to either block the lance or get wounded, but Adam quickly realized that he had another option.</p><br><p>“Right…” Adam smiled faintly. “I’m still far from their level, but fighting in the air is no longer a big problem for me.”</p><br><p>Energy gathered beneath his feet as he created a platform to jump off. The lance flew past his eyes.</p><br><p>His wide grin sent a chill down the monsters’ spines, frightening them more than the intensifying storm.</p>
