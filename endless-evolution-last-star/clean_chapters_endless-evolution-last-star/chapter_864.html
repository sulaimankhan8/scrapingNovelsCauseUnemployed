            <br><p>To say that the nobles were shocked would be an understatement.</p><br><p>No one could understand why Giselle had chosen some commoner as her final opponent, who was only known for surrendering on purpose in his first fight.</p><br><p>However, in just one minute, Adam showed that Giselle was not as strong as they thought, at least compared to him.</p><br><p>Did Giselle notice that?</p><br><br><p>She saw every baffled and shocked look directed at her or Adam. She felt with all her heart that the nobles were no longer seeing her as someone powerful, someone most of them looked up to.</p><br><p>And... The cause of it all stood motionless ten meters away.</p><br><br><p>Giselle gritted her teeth, adopting a fighting stance.</p><br><p>'I shouldn't be thinking about the crowd. I didn't expect the fight to be easy, but... there's something wrong with him.'</p><br><p>Her gaze ran over Adam, trying to find an answer.</p><br><p>Well, she realized everything when she met his gaze.</p><br><p>Deep in Adam's calm blue eyes, she saw an empty, boundless cruelty. He saw her as no rival, only a target to kill, with no right to mercy.</p><br><p>Giselle gulped, while a bitter smile covered her face.</p><br><p>'Well... Now, at least, I'm sure he keeps his promise. He's fighting seriously, that much is obvious. However...'</p><br><p>Frosty vapor abruptly exited her rapier, full of intense energy.</p><br><p>Then, with a quick glint among her gray eyes, Giselle raised the rapier, clutching the hilt tightly.</p><br><p>'I, like you, have defeated strong opponents! I am like you eager to fight at the Dead Lands! I am like you, surviving deadly situations when everyone else died!'</p><br><p>With a sharp movement, Giselle turned her rapier, the long blade pointing toward the ground, reflecting her stern gaze.</p><br><p>'But there is one difference between us.' Giselle shouted to herself, 'I'm a supreme nobleman with a powerful bloodline, and you're just a lucky talent!'</p><br><p>With extraordinary alacrity, Giselle's eyes glowed.</p><br><p>After that, she thrust her rapier onto the ground, letting out a powerful, lonely shiver.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the cold vapor became crystals that turned into avalanches, wanting to collapse and completely engulf Adam.</p><br><p>The barrier of the Twilight Palace instantly activated, preventing Giselle's ice from destroying the important pillars of the great structure.</p><br><p>The nobles stepped back, as did the restaurant staff. They were sure that pretty soon Giselle's attack would demolish everything in its path.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam did not attempt to dodge or block the ice.</p><br><p>With a look full of nonchalance, he watched the approaching avalanche.</p><br><p>Then, strange purple particles flashed before his eyes, causing Giselle to gasp from shock.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With an active tremble, the Initial Gene had finally come into action since the battle against the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>But, this time, it was a little different.</p><br><p>For a moment, Lone Blaze and Moira flew out of the Evolution Tree in their human forms, purple and red flame trails stretched from the core.</p><br><p>Saying nothing, they smirked at each other before just as quickly returning to their new home, releasing a pulse passed throughout the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>The dormant energy awakened, this was Adam's inner space's first opportunity to show itself in something resembling a real fight, though only remotely.</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree let out a short, hoarse laugh like an old man.</p><br><p>[Let's see what you're free for... All three of you... Although... I do not doubt one of you...]</p><br><p>Without a moment's hesitation, all the energy headed towards Adam.</p><br><p>He activated his modified Initial Gene.</p><br><p>A split second before, the ice reached its target, raining down on Adam.</p><br><p>In active torrents, steam rushed outward, filling the passageway and nearly reaching the high ceilings.</p><br><p>However... despite the violent collision, not a single shard flew aside.</p><br><br><p>The drops, one by one, slowly crashed against the smooth marble, accumulating into a small puddle.</p><br><p>In a wide sweep of a hand, the cloud of vapor dissipated, revealing Adam, though something about him changed drastically.</p><br><p>Giselle gulped, not believing her eyes.</p><br><br><p>A long black coat came out of nowhere covering Adam. Inside the coat was dark-purple, with sharp edges and an intimidating aura, not from an item of clothing, but from a powerful ability.</p><br><p>Something similar Adam felt only from two creatures, the Plague Reaper and Katrin.</p><br><p>A wide collar covered his neck, but that wasn't its only function. Two black lines lurked beneath the coat's lapels, trembling slightly as if something could happen to them at any moment, and the coat itself was alive.</p><br><p>It was hard to tell what material the coat was made of, but not for Adam.</p><br><p>"Oh, hah... Now I got something unique too, right?"</p><br><p>Adam's eyes reflected the fabric of his coat, scaled up several times. Thousands if not more threads were tightly bound together into a single object, but that wasn't all of it.</p><br><p>In the tiny gaps between the threads, were clearly visible long strings of flame running along the entire frame as the basic framework for the unusual entity.</p><br><p>A faint smile reflected on Adam's face for a brief period.</p><br><p>'Lone Blaze... I see you...'</p><br><p>Then, his gaze traveled lower.</p><br><br><p>Oddly enough, neither of them tried to contact him. Right now, they were busy maintaining the coat's form.</p><br><p>'Hmm... The Evolution Tree warned me that my Initial Gene would change a lot if I accepted those two, but it shouldn't have completely lost its power, right?'</p><br><p>Without losing his thought, Adam channeled the energy to his fingertips.</p><br><p>It didn't take a second before the threads he knew well, white and sharp as blades fluttered before his eyes.</p><br><p>Adam's hands twitched, he wanted to make a test swing, but at the last moment stopped.</p><br><p>A gleam ran across his eyes, along with a fast-growing, devious smirk.</p><br><br><p>'Now... When I'm K3-Level, I have a lot more freedom of action, don't I?'</p><br><p>Without questioning his decision, Adam stepped forward, taking a fighting stance.</p><br><p>Before Giselle could realize anything, his threads changed their shape, transforming into two simple knuckles, just like Diron's - Giselle's past opponent.</p>
