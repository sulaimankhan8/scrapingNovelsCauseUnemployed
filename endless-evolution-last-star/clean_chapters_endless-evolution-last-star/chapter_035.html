            <h4>Chapter 35: Man vs. Monster and Seeds of Hope</h4><br><p>Every monster had its own threat level, and for a young Phantom like Adam, the green threat level, red book, was the limit even though he was a Naturalborn Phantom and had an artifact. </p><br><p>Dealing with the blue threat level was impossible for him, as it was for most Artificialborn Phantoms who had revealed their Locks. </p><br><p>However, the blue threat level was not the limit for monsters. In this world, even within the First Circle, some monsters could easily handle King of the Golden Searchers, a monster that was one of the strongest members of the Blue Threat Level. </p><br><p>Purple Threat Level was the next level that no Phantom with an open Lock could handle, it required keys. </p><br><p>For Adam, Nera, Mark, and Katrin it was 100% death, but fortunately or unfortunately this monster did not appear to kill them, or rather they were not the reason for the creature's awakening. </p><br><p>To cause a volcanic eruption a light jolt was not enough, something of earthquake level was needed, and Damien was that factor. </p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle. </p><br><p>A long body covered in blue scales like an ancient lizard wriggled, soaring upward to tower over the other creatures of the lower order. </p><br><p>Six broad webbed wings with sharp claws on the far points opened, generating powerful wind currents capable of creating a whirlwind. </p><br><p>Twelve short but dangerous paws with sharp claws twisted with crackling muscles, preparing for battle, while behind them a long tail with a massive ice crystal at the end slowly swayed from side to side. </p><br><p>"ROOOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRRRR!!!! </p><br><p>The monster's roar made everyone except Adam falls to the ground and grabs their heads, trying to endure the horrible echo that was tearing them from the inside out. Streams of blood poured from Adam's ears, but he was able to withstand the pressure. </p><br><p>Damien glanced at him as a slight smile appeared on his face. </p><br><p>'Oh, looks like it's him after all... Clearly, he's Naturalborn One, a needle and a Nexus glove with silver threads... Well, now's not the time for that, I have something more interesting waiting for me!' Damien inwardly exclaimed, looking at the monster whose gaze was directed solely at him. </p><br><p>'Listen to me carefully everyone, I am Beth, Damien's Operator.' </p><br><p>Suddenly a calm and collected voice sounded in their earbuds, Silvana and Alan were no exception. </p><br><p>'The monster that appeared before you is called - Azure Frost Salamander, Prime One, Purple Threat Level, Red Book. Obviously, you can't handle one of these, so I suggest you hide somewhere until Damien can deal with it. Then, a fighter jet will arrive here, and you can go home.' Beth said seriously. </p><br><p>"It's not very polite to break into our closed channels, you know?" Katrin frowned. </p><br><p>'Shut up.' Beth said menacingly, 'The situation is critical, and as an Operator of a Second Rank Phantom my status is now higher than yours. Just keep quiet and obey.' </p><br><p>"Pffft! You can only be formidable with us. I'm sure with Damien you act like an obedient bitch!" Katrin snorted irritably. </p><br><p>'My relationship with Damien is none of your business. Just do what I say if you don't want to die.' Beth replied coldly. </p><br><p>Katrin waved her hand, walking over to the nearest rock. </p><br><p>"Fine, I'm not going to fight anyone else anyway. I've done my maximum." </p><br><p>Then, the others joined her, and Damien headed forward. </p><br><p>After a few steps, he stopped at the edge of the slope with a confident smile on his face, looking at the Azure Salamander. </p><br><p>"Hey, we don't have much time, the most I can give you is one minute." Damien said, showing his index finger, "So let's do without foreplay, let's start with the fun part!" </p><br><p>Azure Salamander nodded slightly as if it could understand what Damien was saying, then it spread its paws apart, channeling energy into them. </p><br><p>In its palms, frost energy accumulated in the form of spheres that quickly began to expand, forming a massive portal of icy vapor. </p><br><p>Then, a giant block of ice, like an iceberg, lunged forward at breakneck speed, whipping through the wind currents like something unstoppable. </p><br><br><p>"Alright, I'm glad you listened to me!" Damien exclaimed before bending down, channeling energy to his feet, and leaping with all his might. </p><br><p>The ground beneath him cracked due to the immense pressure, the white energy caused an explosion throwing him high up. </p><br><p>Then, Damien's fists coated with energy as he attacked, straight into the sharp end of the ice block. </p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crack. </p><br><p>Cracks spread across the entire block, shattering it into dozens of massive shards. Tiny ice dust flew aside at the first rush of wind, coating Adam's black hair, who watched Damien wide-eyed. </p><br><p>Adam knew that this attack would have killed them, but Damien only needed one blow to get rid of the threat. </p><br><p>"Wait... What will he do now...? There are hundreds of meters below him, even if he survives the fall, Azure Salamander will obviously use that time to seriously injure him!" Mark exclaimed in a worried voice. </p><br><p>'Don't worry. For Damien, it's just like for you to kill an ordinary White Threat Level monster. Just observe and learn.' Beth nonchalantly said. </p><br><p>Then, Damien smirked and jumped off the nearest ice debris, then another and another, gradually approaching Azure Salamander. </p><br><p>His speed and strength were enough to use the flying-down debris as platforms for his jumps. </p><br><p>Before Azure Salamander could do anything, Damien was already in front of the monster, his eyes wide with shock. </p><br><p>"Hey! I didn't really want to waste my Nexus on you, but you're too big, and I can't fly, you need wings for that, you know? So, I'll make it quick just don't be afraid." Damien smirked as his boots activated and streams of wind covered them. </p><br><p>Then, Damien slightly bent his body forward, and behind him appeared a circular barrier of tightly compressed air that came from his boots. </p><br><br><p>Azure Salamander roared furiously, unleashing a sound wave that should have deafened Damien, but Damien had predicted that long ago. </p><br><p>He bounced off the wind barrier, quickly finding himself behind Azure Salamander. However, if the monster's attack was unsuccessful, it wasn't true for Damien, who had one of the monster's twelve paws clutched in his hands. </p><br><p>"Do you think you'll die if I rip off all your paws? Well, we'll know that answer in eleven seconds!" Damien smirked before abruptly turning around and bouncing off another wind barrier. </p><br><p>Azure Salamander roared in pain, flapping its wings and paws in an attempt to knock Damien down, but all was to no avail. </p><br><p>After all, when the difference in strength was so great it was no longer a fight between predator and victim or an equal duel between two fighters - now it was the hunter finishing off his prey. </p><br><p>"Unbelievable... So this is what a human is capable of..." Nera muttered in awe watching Damien. </p><br><p>Only six seconds was enough for him to remove half of Azure Salamander's paws, and very soon it would be over. </p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a black fighter jet flew through the storm stream, heading straight for Adam and the others. </p><br><p>Azure Salamander spotted it and extended its remaining four paws, about to destroy the fighter. </p><br><p>"Hey! Don't you dare get distracted! I'm your opponent!" Damien smiled before he swept through the monster's paws, cutting them off with the whirlwinds on his boots. </p><br><p>Then, he climbed high up, watching Azure Salamander, whose body was covered in its own blood. </p><br><p>"Agh... I hate to end this so soon, but circumstances are adjusting. Well, I had a good stretch, thanks." Damien shrugged before bouncing off the wind barrier one last time. </p><br><p>He thrust his legs forward, and a whirlwind pierced the monster's chest, tearing Azure Salamander apart. </p><br><p>Blood merged with the wind currents, recoloring the vortex scarlet, under Damien's enthusiastic smile, the shocked looks of the others, and the last howl of the Azure Salamander. </p><br><p>'Try and fight whatever it takes, and someday you will experience the joy of battle besides fear and stress. All in the name of survival, in the name of us - humanity.' </p><br><p>Beth's voice spread through their minds, that like seeds would grow in them, giving hope for a brighter future.</p>
