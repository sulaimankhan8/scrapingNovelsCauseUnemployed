            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1227: First Grand Star (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>With each level of Phantom, changes occurred in his power, but they always happened differently.</p><br><p>Adam did not expect that when he reached the K4 level, he would gain many abilities at once, as he had in earlier levels. He understood that now it was not the quantity but the quality of abilities that mattered, especially considering his path.</p><br><p>However, when he reached the K4 level, there were quite a few changes, especially in Silvana’s abilities.</p><br><p>Adam wondered if Silvana would become stronger as well. But it was too early to tell, as he was the priority.</p><br><p>‘I see… So my artifact and Initial Gene?’ Adam thought, looking at the Star Runes. ‘Hmm, come to think of it, it’s not surprising that the First Grand Star did not affect Silvana. Changes in her power only occur at the most important moments. It has always been this way.’</p><br><p>Either way, but his most powerful ability from the Evolution Vein was the final condition for destroying the Crystal Gates. In this, unlike many abilities before, Silvana took the leading role.</p><br><p>‘Most likely, I have to create this unknown Constellation, only then will Silvana undergo some changes. Good, if she only develops at my milestones, then she will get the best for herself.’</p><br><p>Adam didn’t say this out loud, but they were in his inner space, and Silvana was so close that she heard every word he said.</p><br><p>However, she didn’t show it, trying her best to hide the blush on her cheeks.</p><br><p>“Ahem.” Silvana coughed. “Adam, it looks like your artifact will be the first. What do you think about that?”</p><br><br><p>“Well, it won’t be the first time my abilities have changed. I can’t say I like some abilities more than others, but losing the effect of this artifact will be a little disappointing.”</p><br><p>“Hahaha.” Silvana giggled. “The Crown of the Fallen Prince, that artifact made you feel like a regenerative monster, right?”</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly. “Yeah, something like that. Although… Damn, that ability is dangerous. I’ve already put myself in mortal danger twice. I won, but… A few small changes wouldn’t hurt.”</p><br><p>After those words, Silvana turned to look at him with wide eyes.</p><br><p>“Hmm? Something wrong?”</p><br><p>“Wow, is my Phantom finally going to stop being a reckless bastard who’s willing to jump into an active volcano if it means defeating a monster?”</p><br><p>“Hahahah!” Adam laughed loudly. “Well, it’s not that this ability is too risky even for me, it’s that it affects both me and my opponent. I mean, if only I could get such incredible regeneration, it would be my favorite ability!”</p><br><p>Then, Silvana looked ahead as she exhaled.</p><br><p>“Phew… I thought you’d finally decided to think about defense or something.”</p><br><p>“Come on, you know that would be a disadvantage for me and hold me back. Hahaha, it’s like putting armor on a horse when its job is to win a race where speed is important!” Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>Silvana nodded weakly.</p><br><p>“Sure, I just hope the new artifact isn’t as dangerous as the last one, or at least that you have complete control over it.”</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same time, streams of energy flowed from the first Star Runes, heading toward the Crown of the Fallen Prince, which sat firmly in its place in the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>With little resistance from the artifact, the Star Rune forced the Crown of the Fallen Prince to leave the Evolution Tree and soar into space.</p><br><p>Adam didn’t want to show it, but his eyes were shining with excitement. This would be the first ability he had received from the Path Construct during his journey as a K4-Phantom, rather than after transitioning to this stage.</p><br><p>So, his expectations were high.</p><br><p>In the battle against Lyrod and especially Bathild, he felt that he had reached his limit as a K4-Phantom. If it weren’t for his Nexus, which gave him enough strength to win even though it pushed him to the limit, Adam would most likely already be dead.</p><br><p>He needed not just the energy and stronger body he got from the Twilight Crystals, but abilities that would render Lyrod and Bathild helpless.</p><br><p>‘Bathild and Lyrod, they were both Elders, but given their situations, they were among the weakest. What will happen when I meet a High Elder? An enemy like that… It will destroy me.’</p><br><p>Adam remembered well the aura of Valdris, who was Saegar’s second-in-command. He didn’t understand it then, but now it was obvious to him that Valdris was a High Elder.</p><br><p>‘Still, even a monster like him can’t do anything against the Barons? Damn, I need some really powerful abilities to fight guys like that!’</p><br><p>It was unknown whether the Path Construct could hear his thoughts and adapt to his desires, but the Path Construct always chose the best option for its Phantom. This mainly depended on what road the Phantom was on and which star he had chosen.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, a cluster of stars condensed in front of the first Star Rune.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana expected his artifact to turn into something else, but the Path Construct’s process was slightly different, more radical.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a laser from a myriad of condensed stars burst out of the first Star Rune, crashing into the Crown of the Fallen Prince.</p><br><p>The dark crown tried to resist, but against such power, it was useless.</p><br><p>In a few seconds, cracks covered the artifact as the dark crown shattered into many fragments.</p><br><p>Silvana gasped in shock, while Adam continued to watch, wanting to know what this sacrifice was for.</p><br><p>[The Crown of the Fallen Prince was destroyed to create a new, more powerful weapon, following the instructions of the Path Construct.]</p><br><p>Then, under Adam and Silvana’s gaze, the entire first Star Rune split into hundreds of symbols that, together with streams of energy, absorbed the destroyed dark crown, creating new outlines.</p><br><p>At first, a sharp blade showed up, then electric discharges, and something else that his two opponents did not have, but was supposed to appear in the future.</p><br><p>With a bright flash, a menacing sword with a long, dark blade appeared before him, electric discharges running along the edge, while two wide, demonic wings were spread wide at the guard.</p><br><p>[The Dual Demon Sword was created.]</p>
