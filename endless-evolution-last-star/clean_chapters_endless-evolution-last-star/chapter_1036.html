            <h4>Chapter 1036: Third Key’s conditions</h4><br><p>Adam didn’t have one arm, but that was temporary. He was almost a K4-Phantom, which meant he was at the top of the food chain at the Red Zone.
</p><br><p>Unless a Hollow Wave monster comparable in power to Arnoth appeared right now, there was nothing to stop Adam from exploring every corner of the Red Zone.
</p><br><p>Right now, though, even Arnoth wouldn’t be a problem for him.
</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, watching as Heret, Arnoth, and Vorx gradually defeated their opponents. They didn’t have enough strength to destroy all the forces of the regenerative monster in one strike, so they had to move gradually.
</p><br><p>’Hmm... If you think about it, at the last moment of our fight, I was at the limit of my capabilities. A little more and I would have just collapsed to the ground, devoid of strength.’
</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Adam scratched the back of his head.
</p><br><p>’What would happen if Arnoth were right in front of me right now, I would have my left arm. I would defeat him without even using my main trump cards. Kreyna... She’d lose to me even if I hadn’t opened the fifth gates, I’m sure of it.’
</p><br><p>This conclusion made Adam wonder.
</p><br><p>How strong were the other Hollow Wave monsters, and how many of them were like Arnoth or Kyros, Crimson Monarch?
</p><br><p>Kreyna was much stronger than the other serpents, she was an S5-monster just like Arnoth, but much weaker yet they both appeared out of the black flash.
</p><br><p>’Tsk, Arnoth told me a lot, but the black flashes... he didn’t say much about them. How many of them are there in total? When do they appear, and do the Hollow Wave monsters always come along with them?’
</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, Heret, Vorx, and Risha had almost finished their fights. None of them were injured, but their breathing became heavier.
</p><br><p>They spent several minutes tearing apart their opponent time after time, which constantly regenerated at an unfair rate.
</p><br><p>"Agh looks like I’m going to have to do this anyway." Adam shook his head before closing his eyes.
</p><br><p>He appeared in front of his Evolution Tree, staring intently straight at the Lock.
</p><br><p>Oddly enough, the Evolution Tree was silent, though it knew what Adam was about to do.
</p><br><p>There were unique conditions for the creation of each key. Adam knew this well and realized that the Third Key would be no exception to this rule.
</p><br><p>"Hopefully, I won’t have to go through torture like with the Second Key again... Connect the stars and be in the dark for a few years... Fuck, that was awful. Brrr!" Adam shook his head from side to side, not wanting to even remember this chore.
</p><br><br><p>Adam touched the last keyhole as dark streams of energy surrounded him.
</p><br><p>He expected to see answers to his questions, but something happened that he didn’t count on.
</p><br><p>[Conditions for creating the Third Key:
</p><br><br><br><p>Adam’s eyes went wide as he blinked a few times.
</p><br><p>Two things were new to him. First, for the first time, there were only two conditions. Second, he didn’t know any of them!
</p><br><p>"Hey! What the hell is that?!" Adam exclaimed menacingly, glaring up.
</p><br><p>[Hah... If you’re looking for answers from me, forget it... I don’t have any...]
</p><br><p>"But, how am I supposed to even understand anything if even my own space is hiding the information from me!"
</p><br><p>[Who knows...? Maybe you need to listen to your gut. I can’t confirm that, but... it seems to me that your idea with the essences is the right one...]
</p><br><p>For a while, Adam eyed the Evolution Tree suspiciously. Eventually, he snorted. He felt that the Evolution Tree didn’t know anything.
</p><br><p>Adam was about to leave and think about what to do next when his attention was caught by a burst of flames from above.
</p><br><p>’Damn, she’s still not done?’
</p><br><p>The fire burned brightly from his Initial Gene. Something was going on up there. Adam knew who was causing it, but no details were shared with him.
</p><br><p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.
</p><br><p>Adam scratched his cheek confusedly. "Since when do I not have access to what’s going on in my world? Agh... I hope it’s worth it."
</p><br><p>There was no telling what Lone Blaze had in store for Adam. She was given a lot of freedom and opportunity, it was as much luck as it was risk.
</p><br><p>She had to take her task seriously and deliver a worthy result. It was the Phantom’s power that influenced it, and the kind of External Artifact he chose for himself.
</p><br><p>When Adam opened his eyes, Heret, Vorx, and Risha had already finished with their opponents.
</p><br><p>"Pfffft! They’re very survivable!" Risha sighed heavily, brushing the sweat off her forehead.
</p><br><p>Everything around her was drenched in blood, chunks of flesh lying among the roots, but no more of them were trying to fuse.
</p><br><p>Each regenerative monster had a limit. As soon as their energy ran out, they could no longer regenerate and became ordinary monsters.
</p><br><p>Vorx smirked, turning in her direction.
</p><br><p>"Hah, we warned you. This is going to be difficult! You got stronger, but you didn’t become omnipotent!"
</p><br><p>Risha was about to reply something, but her eyes went wide as she saw the Blood Hunter appear behind Adam.
</p><br><p>The monster’s powerful paws came together in one fist, about to strike Adam and turn him into a bloody stain.
</p><br><p>For some unknown reason, Adam didn’t notice the monster. It wasn’t his attempt to show his arrogance or carelessness.
</p><br><p>No, Adam didn’t actually feel the Blood Hunter’s aura.
</p><br><p>But... for some reason, the Blood Hunter didn’t attack.
</p><br><p>Out of Adam came an aura invisible to anyone but the Blood Hunter himself. It was not white, on the contrary, it was dark, almost deep black, turning into two indistinct silhouettes.
</p><br><p>One silhouette possessed the outline of a great warrior in heavy armor, reminiscent of a crusader. The other, for some reason more grand and intimidating, indicated a faceless monarch with a single wing and blood flowing in rivers.
</p><br><p>As a result, the Blood Hunter shuddered and ran away, stumbling over roots like a frightened puppy.</p>
