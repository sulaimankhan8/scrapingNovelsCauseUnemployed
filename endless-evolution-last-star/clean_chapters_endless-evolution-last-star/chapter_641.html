            <br><br><p>Evor sat down in his favorite spot by the window, with Ceska sitting across from him as usual.</p><br><p>The other customers and waiters looked at the bloody Phantom with wide-eyed stares. They didn't understand where Evor had gotten such gruesome wounds and why he had come here - to the restaurant and not to the medical department.</p><br><p>Some of the guests were so scared and shocked that they quickly paid their bills and hurried outside.</p><br><br><p>With trembling legs, Silvana approached Evor and Ceska, holding her phone in her hand - she was ready to take their order, just as she always was.</p><br><p>Before she could say anything, Evor slowly turned to her, shifting his gaze to his cigarette.</p><br><p>"Oh, sure, I'm going to throw it out right now..."</p><br><p>However, Silvana stopped him with a shake of her head.</p><br><p>"No need... Today is a special day, and all visitors are allowed to smoke in the hall... Smoke as much as you need, I'll clean it up later..."</p><br><p>Read new chapters at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Evor wasn't stupid, he realized that there was no special day and a mere waiter couldn't do something like that at will.</p><br><p>"I see..." Evor muttered, running his gaze over the tables, there were no ashtrays anywhere, which only confirmed his theory.</p><br><p>"In that case, get me a whiskey."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide for a moment. Evor had never ordered anything stronger than beer, this was the first time.</p><br><p>Then, she glanced at Ceska.</p><br><p>"You want one glass or two."</p><br><p>Evor waved his one hand, a trickle of smoke following his burning cigarette.</p><br><p>"A bottle, then another and another and another... Bring it until I'm no longer thirsty."</p><br><p>Without asking too many questions Silvana nodded silently and headed towards the bar. The next few hours went just as Evor had said: he drank, taking one sip after another, leaving behind only empty bottles.</p><br><p>He drank more hard booze than the average person who drank water in a day while smoking pack after pack of cigarettes.</p><br><p>Silvana watched them closely, Evor's wound, the blood flowing from his arm, and Ceska's calm, peaceful face.</p><br><p>The change was minimal, but Silvana remembered well that when they entered the restaurant, her face was pale and anxious, but now only a slight smile remained.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Silvana's heart beat faster and her green eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>'What a beautiful union... He's wounded but doesn't look weak, and she...'</p><br><p>Silvana shifted her gaze to Ceska.</p><br><p>'She's so calm, how much hardship have they gone through together to reach this level of understanding...? Such trust... I want...'</p><br><p>That very day, Silvana fell in love, but... with whom? Evor? Maybe Ceska? No, she fell in love with the situation, with the roles of both of them and their unknown history.</p><br><p>Having already made up her mind about the Phantoms, Silvana only pictured herself in the place of one of them, in Ceska's place, in the role of Operator.</p><br><br><p>The empty bottle hit, causing the wooden table to shudder. Evor had already drunk so much that even as a Phantom, he was slightly intoxicated.</p><br><p>"Damn... I want to go home." Evor sighed heavily stood up from the table, and headed towards the exit, swaying slightly from side to side.</p><br><p>Ceska was left alone, waiting for Silvana to approach her.</p><br><p>"If you want you can pay this bill when you come next time... I think it's possible..." Silvana mumbled uncertainly. It wasn't allowed, but she could take advantage of the fact that the owner of the restaurant was her mother.</p><br><p>However, Ceska shook her head, pulling out her phone.</p><br><p>"You don't have to. I'll pay for everything."</p><br><p>Silvana nodded quickly calculating everything.</p><br><p>Toward the end, as Silvana was about to leave, Ceska grabbed her sleeve.</p><br><p>"Hey... Thank you. It's been a tough day for Evor today, for both of us. You always serve us, and this time it went as well as ever."</p><br><p>Feeling a strong urge to feel, Silvana's lips came into motion, but Ceska beat her to it:</p><br><p>"I'm sorry, but I noticed the way you were staring at us, and I think you realize that we are not lovers."</p><br><p>In response, Silvana only nodded silently, even a child knew that the Phantoms were assisted by Operators.</p><br><p>"If you want to know more... I wouldn't mind answering you or helping you in any way. The Phantoms need good Operators... They have a dangerous job to do as it is."</p><br><p>Then, Ceska's face turned dark, and her grip became much stronger, Silvana was in pain, but she didn't show it since she didn't want to interrupt Ceska.</p><br><p>"Somehow everyone forgets that there are far fewer Phantoms than monsters... A monster will die, and ten more will take its place. A Phantom dies... and that's it, all that's left is a traumatized Operator."</p><br><p>Realizing she was pushing it too far, Ceska nodded, silently thanked Silvana again, and headed for the exit. Evor was waiting for her, standing against the wall and smoking another cigarette.</p><br><p>For a long time, Silvana stood in one place with her eyes wide open until she slowly came to her senses.</p><br><p>The following two days Silvana just thought about Ceska's words, lots of ideas and musings, but... first she had to figure something out.</p><br><p>With eyes full of determination Silvana went to the Mission Department website, for hours, until deep into the night she tried to find a recording of a mission Evor had recently participated in, but... she failed.</p><br><p>"Shit, it must be a secret mission, or something happened that the common people shouldn't see."</p><br><p>However, she didn't need details, she just wanted to know the situation in general.</p><br><p>So when Ceska and Evor came to the restaurant again the next day, Silvana approached them with a serious face.</p><br><p>Evor's left arm was already in full function, Silvana was surprised that he was able to heal his wound so quickly, but that wasn't what interested her.</p><br><p>"I apologize for my insistence, but..." Silvana said confidently as she bowed low.</p><br><p>Raising her head she stared at Evor.</p><br><p>"As an exception... Can you tell me what happened to you a few days ago?"</p><br><p>Evor blinked a few times before realizing what she was talking about and smiled stupidly.</p><br><p>"Agh... You just... Don't worry, just another hard day and a strong monster... You see, when the enemy is powerful you have to be prepared for wounds, even very serious ones, and I didn't want to go to the medics right away, but just rest in silence, in my favorite place."</p><br><p>Ceska gently took his hand, smiling kindly.</p><br><p>"Yes, and there should always be someone to hold a wounded warrior, right?"</p><br><p>Evor rolled his eyes and looked at Silvana.</p><br><p>"But... why do you ask? I could tell you the full story, but I'm curious about your motives."</p><br><p>Silvana straightened her back and stated in a firm voice:</p><br><p>"I am thinking about becoming an Operator, at least to try. I haven't decided yet, so I need more information."</p><br><p>Evor nodded deeply. Ceska had mentioned Silvana several times in the last few days, he guessed she was interested in their roles, but thought she wished to be a Phantom like everyone else.</p><br><p>"Well... How old are you?"</p><br><p>"I turned 14 a month ago."</p><br><p>"Oh..." Evor sighed briefly, "In that case, you should hurry up and... you have a hard road ahead of you. You don't have much time left, not much at all."</p>
