            <br><p>Before embarking on a long and dangerous journey, one always had to figure out if it was worth it.</p><br><p>The Dormant Lord had to determine if the terrifying crimson energy was as interesting as he thought it would be.</p><br><br><p>Tensing his muscles to the limit, almost reaching the ground with his knuckles, the Dormant Lord threw the plasma spear forward.</p><br><p>A wave of shivers passed from it as it was thrown, several crystals cracked from the sheer power of the shockwave, yet it was not the Crystal Gorge that was the target of the Dormant Lord.</p><br><br><br><p>Multiple Phantom squads ran at a steady pace, eager to reach the gate. Some of them were luckier and the first wave of monsters didn't encounter them, while others had to fight back.</p><br><p>After the incident with the second archer, the squads were clearly instructed not to approach the monsters under any circumstances, otherwise they risked being destroyed by a random shot.</p><br><p>Two times was more than enough to realize how great a destructive power the One-Eyed Serpent Archers possessed.</p><br><p>Not all Phantoms were able to follow this instruction, but they tried and several times it saved their lives.</p><br><p>A total of four shots were fired by the archers so far. The first one at the first squad decided to climb the wall instead of the gates. The second at the monster and the far squad, destroying both. The third and fourth shots occurred while the first Phantoms raced into the fortress, each of the shots aimed at a wave of monsters.</p><br><p>If there were any Phantoms near these monsters, they would suffer the same fate as the second shot.</p><br><p>But, they didn't even know that they were about to face a new threat, and... it had nothing to do with the Phantoms running towards the sanctuary.</p><br><p>Enjoy more content from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><br><p>Several Phantoms raised their heads, near the hills and by the bridge, watching a bright flash rise from the skyline.</p><br><p>It looked like a shooting star, but a real one, moving straight towards them!</p><br><p>The light from the plasma spear was bright enough to illuminate the dark earth beneath, replacing the Phantoms' obscured moon for a few moments.</p><br><p>Katrin, Viron, and Gnash saw it seconds later as they frowned heavily, especially Katrin. She couldn't know for sure, but that star was like the spear that the Dormant Lord threw at the fighter, only much bigger and more powerful.</p><br><p>"Fuck! Everyone, use your abilities! We have to destroy it!"</p><br><p>The Phantoms heard Katrin's command, but some reacted much faster than they did.</p><br><br><p>Two bright purple flashes illuminated the bridge, causing Katrin to turn around.</p><br><p>Her eyes went wide, watching as the two archers, the first and the second, prepared to fire shots no less mighty than all the previous ones.</p><br><p>Their long arms held the massive bows tightly, the purple arrows quivering vigorously on the sturdy bowstring.</p><br><p>The One-Eyed Serpent Archers raised their bows, their pupils narrowing to reflect the plasma spear.</p><br><p>Acting in full synchronization, the One-Eyed Serpent Archers raised their bows, their pupils narrowing to reflect the plasma spear.</p><br><br><p>Then, they simultaneously released the bowstrings.</p><br><p>The two purple arrows, as if they were copies of each other, moved in a precise trajectory straight towards the spear.</p><br><p>Not only the Phantoms but also the monsters were watching this event. The weak ones froze in place in fear, while the stronger ones watched the three projectiles coming at each other.</p><br><p>The wait didn't last long, and soon the purple flashes crashed into the white star.</p><br><p>A blinding flash of light covered the entire Lands of the Lone Serpent, in comparison, the Blinding Sylphyre blast was nothing more than a dim fire.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A deafening explosion shook the space, sending violent winds running through the air in the wake of the powerful shockwave.</p><br><p>The white flame on the left side tried to engulf the purple fire on the right, becoming a rapidly changing orb for a few moments, the active struggle of the two pulses intensifying the tremble with every ripple.</p><br><p>As the shockwave reached the ground, great torrents of wind raised waves of dark sand, knocking down both sturdy trees and monsters in its path.</p><br><p>Those unaffected by the wind watched the mesmerizingly dangerous scene, as if fireworks exploded in the air, the price of which was too high, but its beauty made it impossible for anyone to look away.</p><br><p>Katrin was no exception. Her wide-open black eyes reflected white and purple streams of energy, actively shaking to win this unequal battle.</p><br><p>Then, in a heartbeat, the orb became much larger when the two flames mixed, bursting outward in a destructive blast.</p><br><p>For a moment, even the Phantoms and monsters far away in the fortress or in the hills were deafened, but no one would be able to escape the aftermath...</p><br><p>"No... What kind of power is that..."</p><br><p>Katrin's lips trembled, a chill ran down her spine as she watched hundreds of white and purple clots scattered apart in the impact of the explosion.</p><br><p>These projectiles, like falling asteroids, streamed toward the ground, leaving long trails behind.</p><br><br><br><p>One by one, the asteroids rained down on the earth, on the wastelands, on the monsters and Phantoms, every grain of sand was hit by the hail of stars.</p><br><p>No one could escape the deadly starfall.</p><br><br><br><br><p>Upon reaching the ground, the projectiles exploded, destroying everything around, it seemed impossible to defend against it.</p><br><p>Hundreds of monsters and dozens of Phantoms were killed in a matter of seconds, all that was left behind were bloodstains, deep craters, and burnt earth unnoticeable on the black sand.</p><br><p>But... the borders of the hills were not the target of the starfall, it had no purpose as everything, including the fortress, was in the target zone.</p><br><p>Katrin's pupils narrowed as she drew her sword, intending to repel at least a few projectiles.</p><br><p>"Don't hesitate! Destroy them before they get to you!"</p><br><p>This time the Phantoms weren't as slow as before, soon many bright flashes of different colors flew out from the ground, the Phantoms' abilities, towards the snow-white projectiles.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Yet, several of them fell deep into the fortress, killing multiple of the Shadow Walkers, but becoming a unique opportunity for others... for those who lacked the motivation and reason to return to the fight.</p><br><br><p>The catastrophe, the crisis at the top went unnoticed by the one in the depths.</p><br><p>The one before the Serpent Gates.</p>
