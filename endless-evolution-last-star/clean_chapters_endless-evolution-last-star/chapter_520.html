            <br><p>Franz told the backstory of his desire for revenge against the Marzo Family.</p><br><p>Silvana gasped, covering her mouth with her palm, with her eyes wide open. She realized that for any girl this would be an extreme humiliation, especially for a noblewoman and Nelya, who was already in trouble in noble society because of her low status.</p><br><p>For the first time in a long while, Rosalind showed some emotion. She frowned slightly, clenching her hands tightly behind her back.</p><br><p>After a short period, Franz lifted his head from the pictures, first, he looked at Silvana, then... he shifted his gaze to Adam.</p><br><p>Despite his expectations and the reactions of the others, Adam was calm and even slightly bored.</p><br><p>"I guess my story didn't impress you at all." Franz said in a low voice, gritting his teeth, "May I ask why? Do you think what Zarot did was right?"</p><br><p>Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>"No, what Zarot did is unacceptable, but... somehow I expected to hear a more dire and horrifying reason than public humiliation."</p><br><br><p>Franz's hands collapsed on the table, causing it to crack and an active shudder went through the entire room. He tried to keep his strength under control, but it was clear from his fiery gaze that he was ready to explode at any moment.</p><br><p>"You don't think that's enough? Do you have any idea how Nelya felt? She remembers that day to this moment and there's no telling how long it will be before she's back to normal life! She used to be a bright star ready for new encounters and challenges, and now she sits in her room 24 hours a day, not even talking to the servants who bring her food!"</p><br><p>Adam nodded, as he waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Yeah, I realize the nature of the problem, but... I can't help feeling that it's rather insignificant in the overall scheme of things..."</p><br><p>"What? Insignificant...?" Franz muttered wide-eyed, not believing what he heard.</p><br><p>Adam sighed, slowly looking at Franz.</p><br><p>"This is a localized problem of one person, not even on a physical level, and has nothing to do with the Dead Lands. The fact is, for reality and humanity, a wound on K0-Phantom's body causing him to be unable to kill a few extra monsters matters more than the moral trauma of an ordinary noblewoman."</p><br><p>It seemed like Franz should have lost his temper and gone into a rage, but... he only bit his lip while his whole body trembled.</p><br><p>He himself was a Phantom and a high noble, so he knew what was the immoral and solely practical approach in the plane of which Adam's words were true.</p><br><p>However, that didn't mean there wasn't a problem or that it was something unimportant. For Nelya it was a tragedy, as well as for Franz who cared and loved his sister with all his heart.</p><br><p>This was their family's business, something a stranger like Adam had nothing to do with, at least until now.</p><br><p>"I'm not going to make excuses for Zarot, and the situation is unpleasant, but..." Adam glared at Franz, who was still standing in front of the table clutching his fists tightly.</p><br><p>"You think that taking revenge on the Marzo Family will solve all the problems and Nelya will go back to her past life as if nothing had happened? No, it won't, things like that are not forgotten, never." Adam looked away, resting his cheek on his hand.</p><br><br><p>Silvana and Rosalind were in a similar situation, from time to time they glanced at Adam and Franz, trying to understand the situation and whether or not they should intervene.</p><br><p>"If I were you, instead of focusing on revenge, I would devote time to Nelya and help her recover. It would make sense, both emotionally and practically." Adam said detachedly, offering a solution to the problem.</p><br><br><p>Franz stepped onto the table and abruptly grabbed Adam by the collar of his suit, pulling him roughly.</p><br><br><br><p>Silvana and Rosalind exclaimed simultaneously, not knowing what they were supposed to do.</p><br><p>"You think you're the smart one? What could you possibly know about me and Nelya?! You can't understand us, so sit there and shut up!" Franz shouted directly into Adam's face, whose blue eyes remained calm.</p><br><br><p>"What?!" Franz frowned and his grip grew even stronger, practically ripping Adam's collar.</p><br><p>"Because like you, I have a little sister." Adam uttered in a low voice and deep gaze, staring directly at Franz without fear.</p><br><p>He had no reason to fear Franz, who was most likely significantly stronger, as they were now not talking like men or Phantoms, but like two older brothers taking care of their younger sisters.</p><br><p>"Shit!" Franz growled throwing Adam aside, onto the couch.</p><br><p>Adam said nothing, he only adjusted his collar and leaned his torso forward, closer to the table.</p><br><p>"Hey, Franz." Adam said after a moment of silence.</p><br><p>Franz threw him a quick, annoyed look. He was still angry at Adam, even though he realized it didn't make any sense.</p><br><p>"Although we haven't established all the details of the contract yet, I want to add one condition in advance, without which you can't even hope to get my consent." Adam said serenely with a slight gesture.</p><br><p>Without saying anything, Franz returned to his seat, crossed his arms over his chest, planted one foot on the other, and narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>Discover stories with empire</p><br><p>"What exactly are you talking about? Did you decide to add a new condition right after our little clash? Don't even think about asking for something impossible or being too cocky."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged, glanced at Silvana, and smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"Nah, I'm not going to take advantage of your position. Anyway, if I end up accepting, I want Nelya to come to The Rule of Power and watch my fight from start to end."</p><br><p>Franz's eyes went wide for a moment, he didn't know what to say since he hadn't expected such a thing from Adam.</p><br><p>Adam sighed as he looked at Franz.</p><br><p>"If she's always sitting in her room, her first time out in a long time must be something special, right? For better or worse, most of my fights turned out pretty spectacular, you know?"</p><br><p>A slight smirk appeared on Adam's face, guessing what Franz felt.</p>
