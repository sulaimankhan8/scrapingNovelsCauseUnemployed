            <br><br><p>Whizzing by at tremendous speed, Damien crashed into the wall like a projectile with a loud rumble. This was the effect of just one precise strike from Adam's after he used his Second Order.</p><br><p>"Wha..." Adam let out a sigh more like a wheeze. In some ways, it resembled how Plague Reaper breathed before powerful attacks.</p><br><p>Adam stretched his arm forward, lightly kneading it along with his shoulder before pulling his needle out of the ground.</p><br><p>He lifted his chin confidently looking at Damien, the cloud of dust around him was quickly dissipating, soon his silhouette would be revealed.</p><br><p>"Well by the looks of it it's time to start using the energy, or am I wrong?" Adam said in a calm voice. He was sure he could knock Damien's hat off with this strike.</p><br><p>Soon the smoke screen dissipated causing Adam's eyes to go wide.</p><br><p>Damien was slammed into the wall, but... hardly did he take any damage. His right hand was in front of his chest with his palm open - he took Adam's blow with that hand.</p><br><p>His other hand was holding his hat, which in any other situation would fall off due to sheer inertia.</p><br><p>"Not bad, not bad at all, but as you can see it wasn't enough." Damien said with a slight smile on his face before stepping away from the wall.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>"Even if you could keep your hat, you lost your weapon. With one hand you blocked my attack and with the other, you held your hat."</p><br><p>Damien cast a glance to the side.</p><br><p>"Oh, are you sure? Hehehehe."</p><br><p>Adam flinched, looking in the same direction as Damien. The next thing he saw was a black rod, half buried in the wall, a few meters away from Damien.</p><br><p>"What the hell...? How...?" Adam muttered in disbelief as his eyes went wide.</p><br><p>The scene of their last clash flashed through his mind. Then, Adam could finally see what Damien had done.</p><br><br><p>Before he could block Adam's blow to his chest, Damien abruptly ripped his rod from Adam's grip and threw it back. Then, his palm was in front of his chest, blocking Adam's fist, while his other hand gripped his hat tightly.</p><br><p>Thus, Damien retained his weapon, took no damage and his hat remained on his head.</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, not realizing how that was possible.</p><br><p>"No way... How did he do that? Moreover, he wasn't prepared for Adam to evade his attack, so... Damien just reacted in less than a second and came up with a plan of action?"</p><br><p>Dahla slowly looked at her with her emotionless amber eyes.</p><br><p>"Girl... no, Operator, you mustn't forget who Adam is fighting against."</p><br><p>Dahla said serenely.</p><br><p>"Even if he has lowered his strength to K2-Level, fighting without energy and abilities using a part of some monster as his weapon, it's still Damien. The difference in their mastery is too great."</p><br><br><p>Damien stepped forward, pulling a black rod out of the wall before looking at Adam.</p><br><p>"Adam, I'm not going to lie, that was a good try. You surprised me and managed to take me off guard, but you won't get that chance again. Your First and Second Orders are not enough to knock my hat off as I am now ready for your new opportunities."</p><br><p>Damien pointed his rod at Adam.</p><br><p>"Go ahead and use your next abilities. You're just like any K2-Phantom supposed to get something unique from your Initial Gene, aren't you?" Damien smirked.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes. He knew what Damien was talking about, but didn't immediately agree.</p><br><p>"No, I want to try again. I'm sure I can knock that hat off you, it's not that hard." Adam said, gripping his needle tighter.</p><br><p>Damien didn't say anything, he just nodded slightly, walking slowly towards Adam.</p><br><p>At the same time, Dahla turned around and headed towards the exit of the spectator room.</p><br><p>Silvana turned in her direction.</p><br><p>"Wait... Where are you going?"</p><br><p>Dahla looked at her over her shoulder, turning her head slightly.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Isn't it obvious? Pretty soon they're going to need my help again." Dahla looked at her NEP, "I think in about ten seconds."</p><br><p>Then, Dahla walked out of the room, calmly pacing the empty hallway, towards the chamber.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Damien shortened the distance between them.</p><br><p>"Agh, Adam, you never accept defeat until it's too late. Well, not that it's a bad thing, but I warned you." Damien said calmly when his gaze changed sending a shiver of fear over Adam.</p><br><br><p>Damien tore forward, finding himself in front of Adam. Before Adam could do anything, the tip of the black rod came down on his leg and chest at more than ten points.</p><br><p>'What, how does he move so quickly and deftly? It's like he's been fighting with that rod his whole life!' Adam inwardly exclaimed.</p><br><p>He could barely make out Damien's movements. They weren't very fast, but perfectly precise and correct, Damien didn't do anything unnecessary, keeping maximum time and using the full capabilities of his body.</p><br><p>Adam swung his needle, about to slice into Damien's chest, but before he could lower his needle, Damien was already dodging to the left.</p><br><p>Then, with a serene look, Damien swung his rod while simultaneously turning his body to achieve the greatest inertia.</p><br><br><p>The tip of the rod crashed into Adam's face with such force that his skull cracked and his left eye just flew out.</p><br><p>A chunk of Adam's skin was left on the rod along with the flesh, rare drops of blood fell to the stone floor.</p><br><p>"You're getting stronger, so with each of your defeats I'll have to come up with more drastic methods. So... be prepared if you want to make it to the end." Damien sighed disappearing and finding himself on the other side of Adam.</p><br><p>Adam's eye twitched, trying to keep track of Damien, but as soon as he saw Damien, the world before him tilted.</p><br><p>His right leg was broken and the threads weren't capable of absorbing such sharp and quick damage.</p><br><p>Adam gritted his teeth trying to fight back. If he hadn't used Second Order, without his new gaze he wouldn't even be able to see what Damien was doing, he would just fall to the ground.</p><br><br><p>The black rod slammed into Adam's stomach like a club, then, Damien stepped forward, swung his rod in the air like a bat, and struck Adam's jaw at full speed.</p><br><p>Blood gushed from Adam's nose as several teeth flew out of his mouth.</p><br><p>While Adam was still in a daze, Damien attacked several times at the same point, breaking a few ribs on Adam's right side with his rod.</p><br><br><p>The impact threw Adam aside, predicting him to fall not far from his teeth and eye.</p><br><p>Damien swung his rod knocking off the blood on the floor like with a large paintbrush.</p><br><p>Silvana flinched. She had never seen Adam lose so quickly and easily. Compared to Damien, Plague Reaper was a clumsy and slow monster.</p><br><p>Douglas sighed heavily. He knew something like this would happen when they fought.</p><br><p>"Well... Damien is gradually getting tougher, however... Adam too." Douglas uttered looking at Adam's fiery gaze.</p><br><p>This humiliation made him want to win more and more, he couldn't afford to keep losing like this.</p><br><br><p>The mechanical doors opened letting Dahla inside.</p><br><p>"The wounds are more serious this time." Dahla said calmly.</p><br><p>"Is that a problem for you?"</p><br><p>Dahla shook her head. Experience new tales on empire</p><br><p>"No, not at all. I just need to put his eye back in place, any medic can handle that."</p>
