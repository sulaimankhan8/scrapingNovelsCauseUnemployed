            <br><p>To become a great warrior, one must have experience.</p><br><p>It was an important part for anyone who wanted to climb to the top, for anyone who desired to become the best in their field - no matter what the end goal was.</p><br><p>However... Though most people know, they prefer to forget that experience was almost always gained in the process of something negative, be it defeat or true tragedy - someone's death.</p><br><p>There are hardly many cases in history when the winner learned more after a battle than the loser because mistakes are the best teacher and source of experience.</p><br><p>Nevertheless... sometimes mistakes that become useful experiences for one, lead to the end of the path for others.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, or luckily, Adam had already realized, felt, and seen it personally.</p><br><p>"Argh!!!" Iren's mouth opened wide, and her face twisted in pain from Adam's blow.</p><br><p>The impact threw Iren back a meter, it should have been more, but she managed to regain her balance quickly.</p><br><p>"I think I know what phrase you're talking about, but I don't use it anymore, because it's not true." Adam said calmly.</p><br><p>Iren spits up a clot of blood, wiping it from her mouth.</p><br><p>"Iren! We'll help you!" The young man with the axe said vigorously, ready to rush into battle.</p><br><p>"Stop! Stand aside and keep back!" Iren exclaimed furiously as if this was more important to her than anything else.</p><br><p>Iren stared at Adam, preparing for a fight.</p><br><p>"If I can't make him take responsibility for his actions, for killing an innocent man, then what use I and my perfect reputation?! Someone like him can't be better than me!" Iren snorted before clutching her sword tightly with both hands and pointing it at Adam.</p><br><p>'Killing an innocent man? Pffft, you naive idiot.' Silvana growled, displeased, 'If I were her, I'd do a better job of studying the circumstances of what happened. All the nuances and details matter!'</p><br><p>Adam answered nothing, he just stared calmly ahead while the wind fluttered the tips of his black hair. He realized that words were useless here - only actions could make a difference.</p><br><p>Then, purple energy waves appeared above Adam, unleashing considerable pressure upon him.</p><br><p>"Even Firebreathing Trinadon felt heavy with difficulty to move! Give up, and I won't use my Orders!" Iren exclaimed with an excited expression.</p><br><p>Adam looked around carelessly, shrugged, and took a step forward. It did get a little harder for him at first, but... Iren didn't know that Adam was an unsuitable opponent for her.</p><br><p>In a way, he was a natural enemy for her, on the elemental side.</p><br><p>It was all about Adam's Elemental Root. Even though he had taken the risk of absorbing the black hole in Prismatic Elementals Nest, that made his Elemental Root choose the gravity sprout as its primary element.</p><br><p>That didn't mean that the resistance to other elements was weaker, but because of that, his Trait from Elemental Root was tied to gravity.</p><br><p>Thus, among other bonuses, Adam had the highest resistance to this particular element.</p><br><p>Considering his physical stats, Power Gene, and Elemental Root, Adam hardly felt the pressure from Iren's gravity. He may have started to weigh a few kilos more, but it was too insignificant.</p><br><p>"What... What's going on...?" Romeo muttered in confusion. It was the first time he had ever seen Iren's gravity so weak. Adam didn't slow down at all, he just kept moving forward!</p><br><p>"Hey. You got something on your mind?" Adam asked, finding himself in front of Iren. He pushed her sword away with his palm to walk further - practically colliding with her forehead.</p><br><p>Iren blinked a few times as if she did not realize that this was reality.</p><br><p>Never before, had an opponent of her level been able to stand so confidently on his feet under her force.</p><br><p>"Get away from me!" Iren exclaimed as she swung her sword with a frightened look.</p><br><p>Adam put his hand in front of him, blocking Iren's slash with the threads on his glove - they were strong enough to only shudder like strings on a harp.</p><br><p>"Why won't my gravity work on you... What kind of trick are you using?!" Irene exclaimed.</p><br><br><p>Then he shrugged and calmly said, "I don't know. Maybe it's all because I'm just stronger than you? Maybe that's what matters?"</p><br><p>Iren's face contorted, with anger and rage. She couldn't admit that it was true.</p><br><p>'A bastard who doesn't respect the rules can't be better than me!' Iren inwardly exclaimed before once again using her ability. Her eyes flickered, and her sword flashed brightly.</p><br><p>It put a serious strain on her body, blood came from the corners of her mouth and nose, but she wasn't going to stop.</p><br><br><p>Four purple spheres appeared above Adam, about to do the same thing to him as to Firebreathing Trinadon. Iren could crush the monster to the ground, so Adam couldn't avoid the same fate.</p><br><br><p>Adam dropped to one knee as his eyes went wide. All his muscles strained to keep his face from falling to the ground.</p><br><p>'Oh... This is different from the one before. Shit, am I really not going to be able to take this?' Adam internally muttered, clenching his teeth tightly.</p><br><p>But, gradually, he could feel himself getting better. It wasn't that Iren had weakened, though she couldn't use that ability for too long, it was that his body was adapting.</p><br><p>It could be compared to a heavyweight - if one took 100 kg at once, one would fall over from the shock, but if one gradually took 10 kg at a time, increasing the weight each step, no such problems would occur. Of course, this works only if one could initially lift such a weight.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Adam's Elemental Root trembled, emitting a glow as the purple color slightly increased to occupy a bit more area - this happened when necessary.</p><br><p>The Evolutionary Tree was like a living organism and could adapt to the situation as a human did.</p><br><p>"Well, there you go." Adam smirked before confidently getting to his feet.</p><br><p>While Iren was trying to figure out if she was dreaming, electric shocks ran through Adam's legs, and he disappeared from her sight.</p>
