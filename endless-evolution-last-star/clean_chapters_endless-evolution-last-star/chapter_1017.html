            <br><p>Adam's path, his final attack, was seen by every serpent.</p><br><p>None of them, not even Grita and Torz, were able to capture every moment, to see all the details as it happened too quickly. But, it was obvious to everyone that this attack was going to defeat Arnoth, end his road.</p><br><p>"Fuck... It didn't work?" Grita shuddered, her eyes filling with fear.</p><br><p>Risha gulped. She saw Arnoth and Adam standing against each other. They were talking about something, something important, judging by Adam's reaction, but from this distance, it was impossible to hear them.</p><br><p>"It's..." she stammered. "Adam must have some kind of trump card, right?"</p><br><p>She looked at Grita and Torz but saw only their dark faces. They realized that Arnoth was just now showing his true strength, and Adam had already gone beyond his limits.</p><br><p>The hidden watcher, Hygon, narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>'Is it time for me to intervene? Although... Orel didn't say anything about protecting this guy. If he dies, I'll just take Risha and return him to the fortress.' He inwardly nodded. 'Right, that's what I'll do, but...'</p><br><p>His gaze stopped on Adam.</p><br><p>'I wouldn't want you to lose, guy. You still have one remedy, but no one knows if you'll be able to use it.'</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam became wary, watching the spots of light covering the ceiling.</p><br><p>Arnoth's energy was traveling upward in an endless stream, more intense and powerful than ever. Adam could sense a change in his energy, but it wasn't surprising since part of it belonged to Lost Light.</p><br><p>"Hey... Before we go any further, do you want to answer my last question?" Adam asked, Silvana's energy allowing him to recover to a fighting state.</p><br><p>A slight curiosity reflected in Arnoth's amber eyes.</p><br><p>"Sure, but you must hurry. I won't be able to contain this much energy for too long."</p><br><p>Arnoth knew Adam wasn't trying to trick him or buy time. He needed an answer, and Arnoth was ready to give it.</p><br><p>"Are you still a crusader or just a warrior?" Adam asked, looking at the wreckage at Arnoth's feet. "You don't have a shield or sword anymore. Apparently, from the beginning, all of that was just equipment for the image and not your real power."</p><br><p>"Hahaha!" Arnoth chuckled briefly, joy filling his voice. "Of course I am!"</p><br><br><p>He smacked his chest, right on his golden mark.</p><br><p>"My job as a crusader is to protect the soul closest to me! The shield is not a gear, the shield is a symbol of my purpose!"</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly. "I see..."</p><br><p>He couldn't shake the feeling that with Lost Light's appearance, he saw not only Arnoth's true power, but what kind of person he really was.</p><br><p>'Shit... Honestly, I'm much more comfortable fighting against a majestic knight in armor than a joyous four-meter-tall man with a golden spirit on his back.'</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the next tremble of energy, Arnoth swung his arms upwards.</p><br><p>Dozens of golden pillars of light rained down on the throne room, in a heartbeat reaching both the marble and the wounded Adam.</p><br><p>Without a moment's hesitation, Adam bounced to the side. He blinked, receiving a star in his right eye - another gift from Silvana.</p><br><p>She was far away, but she had helped him and taken part in the battle during the most difficult period. However, her limits were far lower than Adam's. The dark circles appeared under her eyes as her face became a little paler.</p><br><p>A pillar of light appeared right in front of Adam, but he reacted in time.</p><br><p>One by one, the pillars destroyed the throne room, Arnoth no longer planned to linger there.</p><br><p>His mission would end at Adam's death.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Under the pressure, the throne room collapsed, forcing Adam to jump through the rubble until he was on the first floor. Unlike him, Arnoth slowly descended on the stream of golden energy.</p><br><p>The massive throne that had belonged to him for months crashed down, sinking halfway into the ground.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes darted sideways - to Kreyna's remains. He knew that Risha had won, but he was shocked to see the aftermath of their fight.</p><br><p>In a flash of light, one of the pillars rained down directly on Kreyna. It seemed like it was Arnoth's mistake, for there wouldn't be a piece of Kreyna's body left afterward.</p><br><p>But, as soon as the light reached its target, a dense golden barrier appeared around Kreyna. It absorbed all the power of the pillar, directing it to a single point.</p><br><p>The golden beam shot straight at Adam, taking him by surprise.</p><br><br><p>He swung his torso sharply to the side, but the beam caught his right shoulder, leaving a deep cut.</p><br><br><p>Arnoth sank to the ground beneath the rumble of crumbling castle walls. One column after another fell under the pressure, just as the tall peaks lost their support.</p><br><p>The once great castle, where the king and queen of serpents had reigned, was now nothing more than ruins, a battleground for the monster and the Phantom.</p><br><p>Grita and Torz gasped, a bright pain piercing their hearts.</p><br><p>"No... That bastard..." Grita clenched her fists, her claws piercing the skin, releasing trickles of blood. "He destroys everything he touches. He doesn't even realize how important it is to us..."</p><br><p>The other serpents were in the same situation. They were forced as Arnoth was wrecking their heritage, there was nothing they could do because getting close to Arnoth meant certain death.</p><br><p>"Agh..." Arnoth took a deep breath, slowly lowering his hands to his sides. "That was refreshing. Don't you think so, Adam?"</p><br><p>"What are you talking about?"</p><br><p>Arnoth smiled weakly as he waved his hand. "Look around. Now, not only the throne room, but the entire castle is our battlefield. If you wish, we can go beyond that, but... I doubt that will happen. I'd like your grave to be here - you deserve this place."</p><br><p>Lost Light nodded slightly.</p><br><p>"Yes... Our opponent earns respect... It's the right thing to do."</p><br><p>Adam took a step back, clutching the hilt of his needle tightly.</p><br><p>At the same time, Lone Blaze who was trying unsuccessfully to calm Moira down or at least talk to her, stopped.</p><br><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed something.</p><br><p>The first crack appeared on the Fifth Gate.</p>
