            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1271: Flowers and Tea (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>The Dead Lands were a vast place with various monsters and territories, and the Tarnished Lands and the Dark Shore were no exception to this rule.</p><br><p>The number of monsters was estimated to be in the billions, with tens of billions, and the number of different species reached one hundred thousand.</p><br><p>Well, that was the approximate information that the Citadel had. Every second, everything changed, especially after the World Wipe. Many types of monsters disappeared forever, while others appeared.</p><br><p>It was a natural process, and Adam encountered one of the new monsters that no one had ever seen before—the Silver Weaver. It happened at the very beginning of his journey and changed his life forever.</p><br><p>Most often, monsters were born from energy, so it was not surprising that monsters, their appearance, and abilities were suited to the territory where they appeared.</p><br><p>Sure, fire, water, wind, and so on were practically classics that even a child who had first heard about monsters a few days ago could understand.</p><br><p>But this also applied to more complex elements.</p><br><p>Threads were one of them.</p><br><p>In this world, there were a fairly limited number of creatures capable of creating and using threads at will. It was a difficult and, to some extent, refined ability.</p><br><p>Still, the moths clearly fit this description, and Adam was facing some right now.</p><br><p>He didn’t know what to expect from the white mill, but the next monsters couldn’t surprise him in any way.</p><br><br><p>“They’re not attacking…” Adam muttered as several more moths appeared at the foot of the mill.</p><br><p>Their wings were wide and bright even when folded, and their amber eyes watched Adam with curiosity.</p><br><p>Sure, a fire immediately ignited inside Adam. He wanted to fight these creatures that must have the treads just like him, but he quickly calmed that desire.</p><br><p>“I didn’t come here for that… Moreover, the Connected String wants to send me to other mills. Still, I must have some purpose here, right?”</p><br><p>Silvana appeared next to him for a moment, looking around.</p><br><p>“I think you should move on. This mill, her sails continue to move, which means someone or something must be monitoring the mechanism inside, right?”</p><br><br><br><p>“Just… If we came here with peaceful intentions, we should behave accordingly.”</p><br><p>Adam gave her a sharp look. “Are you saying I can’t go a minute without attacking someone? Do you think I’m some wild beast?”</p><br><p>Silvana rolled her eyes and disappeared, leaving Adam alone.</p><br><p>But she was right, and Adam knew it.</p><br><p>“Alright, moths. Don’t attack me, and I won’t touch you either.”</p><br><br><p>Adam moved forward, carefully walking along the barely visible path through the flower field.</p><br><p>With each step he took, more moths appeared around him, but they just watched. There was no malice or aggression in them, only genuine curiosity.</p><br><p>The Forgotten Mills was one of those places where Phantoms rarely appeared.</p><br><p>If a Phantom wanted to go deep into the Tarnished Lands, to the Renegades’ territory, they took other routes, not crossing the Forgotten Mills.</p><br><p>So, the moths’ interest was understandable, although over time it made Adam feel uncomfortable.</p><br><p>‘Damn, they’re staring at me so intently… This is weird.’ Adam touched his temple before shaking his head and slightly quickening his pace.</p><br><p>Since the moths weren’t doing anything and weren’t releasing their auras, it was difficult for Adam to determine their true power. However, he understood that it was the Black Threat Level, approximately below-middle.</p><br><p>For someone like Kara and Toa, they were no threat, but if there were dozens or even hundreds of them, it would be a real problem.</p><br><p>A minute later, Adam found himself in front of the entrance to the white mill—he was greeted by large, locked gates.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, one of the moths flew up to him, coming so close that its antennae almost touched Adam’s face.</p><br><p>Then, the moth pointed its leg at the sharp peak protruding from the gate and at Adam’s hand.</p><br><p>The message was delivered.</p><br><p>Adam smiled faintly as he nodded.</p><br><p>“I see. Thank you. That’s a valuable clue.”</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam did what was necessary. He pressed his hand against the sharp peak, allowing blood to run down its edges, filling the intricate pattern of the barely visible seal that covered the center of the gate.</p><br><p>However, when the entire seal was filled with his blood, the gate did not open—something else was needed.</p><br><p>“I gave my blood, but… Something is missing?” Adam wondered.</p><br><p>But as soon as his Evolution Tree trembled once, his eyes widened. He understood what needed to be done.</p><br><br><p>A clump of white energy with tiny black particles floated on his hand before heading to the bloodied peak.</p><br><p>The energy spread across the seal in a single stream.</p><br><p>Several flashes burst out, illuminating the plain, as if testing whether Adam could open these gates.</p><br><p>Not only did his blood have to be suitable for this, but also his energy, and the second part was much more important than the first.</p><br><br><p>There was a click, like from a mechanism, as the gate slowly began to move with a loud creak.</p><br><p>At the same time, the moths began to run around in circles, as if celebrating Adam’s ability to open the gate.</p><br><p>For these lands, it was something truly rare.</p><br><br><p>He did not expect such a complex, exquisite entrance from the white mill.</p><br><p>‘Alright, let’s see what this is all about…’ Adam nodded to himself and stepped forward.</p><br><p>In the first few seconds, the bright light blinded him, preventing him from seeing anything. He had to cover his eyes with his hands.</p><br><br><p>As soon as he was inside, the gates behind him slammed shut and would only open when Adam received permission to do so.</p><br><p>“What…?” Adam’s eyes darted to the side.</p><br><p>The first thing he noticed was a table with a teapot and two cups of tea—steam was rising in streams, it had been brewed a few minutes ago.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, footsteps sounded from above, causing Adam to raise his gaze to the grand staircase.</p><br><p>“Young Phantom…” A sweet, feminine voice filled the void. “I didn’t expect to see you today, but I’m indescribably glad.”</p><br><p>Adam’s fingertips twitched. He didn’t know what to expect, but his heart began to beat faster.</p>
