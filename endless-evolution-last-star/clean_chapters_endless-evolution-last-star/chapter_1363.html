            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1363: Another Rule</strong></p><br><br><p>The white spear flew at high speed straight towards the red heart, causing the Azure Wyvern to become nervous for the first time in their battle.</p><br><p>Once Adam destroyed the red heart, the third trial would come to an end. Obviously, the Azure Wyvern couldn’t let that happen, but standing in the way of the white spear was too dangerous. Everyone had seen what Adam’s new ability was capable of.</p><br><br><p>The Azure Wyvern roared as frosty gusts of wind rose from the void below.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the great frost created a protective wall of thick ice in front of the red heart to reduce the damage as much as possible.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes as he watched his spear. He didn’t know the full power of his ability, so he wasn’t sure how effective it would be.</p><br><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>The white spear easily pierced the barrier before crashing into the glacier, where, several meters of dark blue ice, the red heart was hidden, shackled in chains.</p><br><p>However, this was not enough to reach the red heart. About halfway there, the energy of the white spear ran out as it dissipated into particles of energy.</p><br><p>The Azure Wyvern’s eyes narrowed as it looked at the aftermath of the destruction.</p><br><p>The glacier that was the foundation of the fortress now had a deep hole several meters wide, but so far, the red heart was safe.</p><br><p>Or… did the Azure Wyvern want it to be that way?</p><br><br><p>A new, third spear appeared in Adam’s hand as he made his next throw.</p><br><p>It seemed that the Azure Wyvern should have expected this to happen. After all, Adam had previously created the second spear, even though everyone was sure that this ability was his trump card and could only be used once.</p><br><p>Still… the Azure Wyvern couldn’t believe what it was seeing. For the third time, Adam easily created a weapon that shook the third trial and turned it into a shooting range for Adam.</p><br><br><p>Before the Azure Wyvern could react and realize that this throw could not be allowed, the white spear had already cut through space, crashing into the glacier.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>Like a giant drill, the spear pushed its way forward, throwing out fragments of ice.</p><br><p>“GROOOO!” The Azure Wyvern roared and rushed in panic to save the red heart, but it was already too late.</p><br><p>The white spear reached the red heart under Adam’s watchful gaze.</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The tip of the spear trembled violently, trying to overcome the invisible barrier in front of the red heart. Something prevented the white spear from making the final move to destroy the red heart.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the chains binding the red heart sprang into motion, tearing the white spear to pieces.</p><br><p>Without delay, the dark chains released a menacing purple aura and headed through the glacier towards its strongest defender – the Azure Wyvern.</p><br><p>The Azure Wyvern’s expression showed that the monster did not expect such an outcome, but at the same time did not rush to resist. The chains covered its legs and wings, like ancient armor emitting a thick, dark aura.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened in disbelief. Not only because this was the first guard to receive reinforcement from some object in the trial area, but also because the initial reinforcement was quickly disappearing.</p><br><p>Three silver wing signs broke into pieces, leaving the Azure Wyvern’s chest like unwanted dirt.</p><br><p>Despite this, the Azure Wyvern’s power level did not decrease, on the contrary, it became higher, but it was not only about pure power, but also about the eerie presence that sent a chill down Adam’s spine.</p><br><p>“What the hell is going on…?” He muttered, looking at the Azure Wyvern in disbelief. This had never happened before, and the fact that the silver wing signs had disappeared showed that it was not the will of the Silver Beacon.</p><br><p>Adam assumed that the red heart was acting on the wishes of someone or something else.</p><br><p>He was not mistaken.</p><br><br><p>“This… This dark aura…” Bertrada’s teeth chattered as if she were in the cold, and goosebumps ran down her body. “Where did it come from? Why does this heart possess this energy, and can it use it? This has never happened before!”</p><br><p>Her face grew paler with each passing moment until her pupils narrowed as she realized something.</p><br><p>“The White Spire… Could he still be alive? No, that’s impossible. He died long ago… Could these chains have been preserving a tiny part of his energy all this time?”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, while Bertrada was trying to understand where the dark energy that overpowered her own and made the guard much stronger than she could be, according to the rules, came from, Mona, who was standing aside, knew a little more about it.</p><br><p>“I see… As soon as he passed the first trial after choosing the amber crystal, the main goal became the dark fragments, not ascension here, at the glass sphere.” Mona shuddered inwardly. “Master… Although you cannot be brought back, even the part of your power that remains allows you to create new warriors worthy of going against the whole world.”</p><br><p>Her gaze deepened as she looked at the shocked Adam.</p><br><p>‘I can only hope that Adam will be able to pass this trial. The third trial from Bertrada no longer matters, now it’s time for the first trial from the White Spire!</p><br><p>Fortunately for Mona, Bertrada was not looking in her direction, she was too deep in thought, but she came to the same conclusion as Mona.</p><br><p>The Azure Wyvern had received a piece of power from the White Spire, and there had to be a reason for that. The dark fragments had made it possible, but Bertrada didn’t know that detail.</p><br><br><p>The two dark fragments trembled, causing Adam to glance at them, but soon something else took his attention.</p><br><br><p>A thunderous roar spread throughout the trial area as the Azure Wyvern spread its wings wide, creating dozens of portals.</p><br><p>Countless chains burst out of the portals, heading toward the wyverns, significantly increasing their power as well.</p><br><p>Adam gulped as he realized what was happening.</p><br><p>Now, even with his new ability, he was unable to win.</p><br><p>He needed the trial item, his only salvation.</p><br><p>But where could it be? Maybe he should head toward the light?</p>
