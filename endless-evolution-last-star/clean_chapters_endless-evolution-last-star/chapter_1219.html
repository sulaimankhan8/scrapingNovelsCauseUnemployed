            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1219: Cruel Sun (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Clash. Clash. Clash.</p><br><p>The Silver Prince, with a surge of new strength, became as strong as Moroya, relentlessly raining down attacks on Fromund, who was desperately trying to resist.</p><br><p>If he hadn’t used the power of his spear, Fromund would have been able to fight the Silver Prince on equal terms, but he had been forced to do so.</p><br><p>Now, he had to find a way to deal with the Silver Prince, but Fromund didn’t know how to do it.</p><br><p>“Shit, he’s gotten much stronger!” Fromund glanced at the amber layer of energy surrounding the Silver Prince. “I can barely keep up with his attacks, and that bitch! She’s the main problem!”</p><br><p>As before, Moroya remained on the sidelines. From time to time, she attacked from a distance, leaving scratches and cuts on Fromund’s body. Thanks to his quick reflexes, he managed to avoid critical wounds, but eventually his body would reach its limit.</p><br><p>However, the main threat from Moroya was not that.</p><br><p>Every time Fromund managed to wound the Silver Prince, which happened quite often, Moroya used her abilities to heal him.</p><br><p>Sure, she wouldn’t be able to heal the Silver Prince forever; eventually, her energy would run out, especially considering how much strength she had spent creating the multi-layered barrier, but their situation was much better than Fromund’s.</p><br><p>Eventually, the Silver Prince’s strength would return to normal, and Moroya would be exhausted, but long before that, Fromund would be dead.</p><br><p>‘Alright, I can do this one more time. Arayna, let’s try to take care of this bastard!’</p><br><p>In response, he heard only her calm voice.</p><br><p>‘As always, I will follow your decisions. We will win, don’t try to take on too much.’</p><br><p>Fromund shrugged with a sly grin.</p><br><br><p>Then, a stream of energy flowed from Arayna toward Fromund as the blaze ring behind him began to spin rapidly.</p><br><p>The Silver Prince flapped his wings to quickly fly back to a safe distance. He had no intention of repeating his brother’s mistakes.</p><br><p>At that moment, three weapons appeared in the blaze ring at once — a hammer, a sword, and a spear.</p><br><p>Moroya had never seen anything like this, nor had Marhen, who had been watching Fromund closely, but it was practically all he had left.</p><br><p>At the same moment, dozens of points of light appeared above the cave, from which sharp points emerged.</p><br><p>Moroya’s eyes widened as she immediately understood what was happening.</p><br><p>“Try to defend yourself from that, Queen!” Fromund exclaimed with a wave of his hand.</p><br><p>Then, an endless stream of flaming spears rained down on Moroya and the Silver Prince.</p><br><p>Moroya did not have enough energy to block each one and protect the Silver Prince, who rushed toward her and deflected the first spears with his sword.</p><br><br><p>The spears exploded, leaving shallow craters in the ground, but these were only the first of many. Fromund spent most of the energy that Arayna had saved for emergencies on this attack.</p><br><p>Unfortunately for Fromund, Moroya had a way to defend herself without a barrier.</p><br><p>“My servants!” Moroya exclaimed, raising her fist. “Come to me! I need your protection!”</p><br><p>“What…?” Fromund was puzzled.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the Kirani Bugs, without regard for their own lives, flew out of the caves and crevices, one after another, crashing directly into the flaming spears.</p><br><p>A cascade of explosions rippled through the air, becoming more intense and destructive with each Kirani Bug that gave its life to destroy another spear.</p><br><p>Charred pieces of flesh covered the ground, as pieces of wings and chitin fell at Fromund’s feet, showing that even against him, quantity could become quality and lead his enemy to victory.</p><br><p>In the end, the spear hail did almost no harm to Moroya and the Silver Prince. A few burns were visible on the prince’s shoulders, but they were nothing.</p><br><p>If it weren’t for the dozens of Kirani Bugs, the consequences would have been much worse.</p><br><p>The most frightening thing was that most of the Kirani Bugs remained in place. There were several thousand of them in the colony, and only a few had to sacrifice themselves.</p><br><p>Moroya licked her lips as she looked at the confused Fromund.</p><br><p>“Well, well, it seems that this is not the result you were hoping for, is it?”</p><br><p>Then, her insidious laughter rang out across the colony.</p><br><p>“Hahaha! You were so sure of yourself, but what will you do now? Nothing!”</p><br><p>The Silver Prince lunged forward, appearing before Fromund faster than he could comprehend.</p><br><br><p>The long sword pierced Fromund’s shoulder, as a sharp pain brought him to his senses.</p><br><p>“FUCK! Get away from me!” Fromund swung his spear, pushing the monster away.</p><br><p>But as soon as the Silver Prince’s feet touched the ground, he lunged forward, leaving a wide gash on Fromund’s chest with his next swing.</p><br><p>“You’ll die right here, right now, Phantom!” Moroya exclaimed and spread her arms wide.</p><br><p>The energy pulsations receded from her like a core, filling every Kirani Bug in its path with energy, making them much stronger for a short time.</p><br><br><p>Blocking the Silver Prince’s sword, Fromund was about to attack, but stopped mid-swing.</p><br><p>Hundreds of red eyes stared at him from the dark corners of the cave, and now, thanks to Moroya’s energy, they posed a real threat to Fromund. He felt that even a simple Kirani Bug could hurt him by digging its sharp legs into his side.</p><br><p>‘No… You don’t mean that now, all of them…?’ Fromund’s eyes darted from one monster to another.</p><br><p>Seeing his growing despair, Moroya slowly pointed at him.</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, the Silver Prince and the entire Kirani Colony descended upon Fromund. There were so many monsters that within seconds they completely blocked Fromund’s silhouette.</p><br><p>All Moroya could see was a huge pile of hundreds of monsters gathered in one spot, with Fromund in the center, fighting for his life.</p><br><p>“Hah, he can’t possibly fight them all off. Maybe if he had saved his flame spears, but not now!” Moroya exclaimed inwardly with a mad look in her eyes. “Victory is mine!”</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>Suddenly, the crackling sound caught her attention.</p><br><br><p>Beams of light appeared among the bodies of the monsters as the temperature rose sharply.</p><br><p>Unable to withstand the heat, many of the Kirani Bugs flew away, momentarily revealing Fromund’s figure, who had abandoned his spear.</p><br><p>His gaze was as calm and cruel as ever, contrasting with Moroya’s eyes.</p><br><p>“I see… The time for the cruel sun has come… right?” His hoarse voice echoed off the cave walls.</p><br><p>Then, behind him, a spectral figure of a girl with long blonde hair appeared and gently embraced him from behind.</p><br><p>Like any K4-Phantom, Fromund’s true trump card lay in the power of his Evolution Vein and his connection to his Operator.</p>
