            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1155: Spear and Shockwave</strong></p><br><p>Two powerful monsters and a whirlwind controlled by some External Artifact wanted to reach Adam and take the energy hidden inside him.</p><br><p>It didn’t matter if it was a Lesser Elder or an Elder, an F1 Black Threat Monster or an F5 Black Threat Monster, if such a monster killed Adam, the energy inside him would be enough for the monster to evolve.</p><br><p>Sure, it was unlikely to turn a High Elder into a Lord, but even for them, Adam was of great value, though not as great as for monsters slightly weaker than them.</p><br><p>Adam would never have been able to deal with such opponents. Even if he hadn’t been exhausted from the battle with Lyrod, the whirlwind and two monsters equal in strength to Elders were an insurmountable obstacle for him.</p><br><br><p>Adam ran as fast as he could, it was his only chance until he realized that there had always been protection above his head.</p><br><p>One Phantom was enough to protect the sky beneath the head of every important Phantom, if he could be helped.</p><br><p>Adam’s wide-open eyes reflected a huge azure spear that pierced the ground faster than he could comprehend.</p><br><p>Once, at the beginning of his journey, he had seen a similar spear, only it was much smaller and weaker. At that time, he was too weak after the battle against Prime Goliath, so he didn’t think much of it.</p><br><p>Frida used different spear sizes, power, and speed each time, depending on a variety of factors. One of the most important things was how strong the Phantom she was trying to rescue was.</p><br><p>For a split second, the two monsters and the creatures in the vortex realized that something was rushing toward them. Their instincts acted faster than their minds, but it was still too slow for them to have any chance of saving their lives.</p><br><p>Nothing remained of the monsters or the vortex. The spear didn’t even touch them, the sheer power of its pressure tore them to shreds.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A tremor ran across the ground for dozens of kilometers, shaking countless lakes that filled the dark lands.</p><br><p>A shockwave with wild gusts of wind swept away everything in its path, hilltops were blown away, acid spilled over the banks, and old buildings were reduced to debris that flew straight toward Adam.</p><br><p>‘Fuck!’ Adam exclaimed inwardly as he jerked to the side in an attempt to find a safe place.</p><br><p>Thanks to her Operator, Frida had all the information she needed. However, a Phantom of her level could sense everything quite accurately simply through her aura.</p><br><p>It wasn’t just how strong Adam was, but also what kind of monsters were hunting him. Therefore, Frida simply couldn’t throw a spear that wasn’t powerful enough, even if the shockwave could harm Adam.</p><br><p>The most important thing was to save Adam and deal with the threats, the rest wasn’t as important.</p><br><p>Crash. Crash. Crash.</p><br><p>Debris crashed into the hill before tearing it apart. At the same time, Adam jumped forward, hiding behind the sharp edge of the cliff at the last moment.</p><br><p>He looked up as his heart beat like crazy.</p><br><p>The shockwave swept right over him in several powerful surges that seemed endless.</p><br><p>Only after a few minutes did Adam decide to climb back up to see what had happened to the Corrosive Lakes.</p><br><p>“Holy shit…” His broken voice rang out in disbelief.</p><br><p>The ground near him wasn’t badly damaged, but at the epicenter, it was a completely different story.</p><br><p>Where the spear had fallen, there was now a huge crater, and everything around it was covered with debris, dust, and dark sand laid in an even layer. Sharp spikes protruded from the destroyed ground while the great spear slowly disintegrated into fragments.</p><br><p>Adam gulped as he clenched his fists tightly.</p><br><p>“This… Is this the true power of a Second Rank Phantom?”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam asked:</p><br><p>“Silvana, do you know who that was?”</p><br><p>She was in shock, just like Adam, but she found the strength to compose herself and answer him.</p><br><p>‘I suppose it was Frida… She’s the main figure in the Azure Lotus. If you remember, you had problems with them when you were in prison…’</p><br><p>Sure, Adam remembered well the events when he killed a simple man because he insulted Trici.</p><br><p>At that time, Adam lost control, but he had no regrets. Especially now that he knew about the World Wipe and other problems in their world, it no longer mattered.</p><br><p>“Yes… Not just prison, I remember that spear. Back then, it was much smaller and weaker, but the shape, energy, and speed were the same. Hah… That spear with such a powerful shockwave would have killed me that day.”</p><br><br><p>‘Those monsters were very strong. She couldn’t hold back her power, it seems like it’s her job to save Phantoms like you.’</p><br><p>“That’s your assumption, right?”</p><br><p>‘Sure, I’m afraid I can’t learn much about Frida’s tasks. It’s too high a level.’</p><br><p>With the next gust of wind, Adam smiled bitterly and ran his hand through his hair.</p><br><p>“Hah, that’s enough of the Tarnished Lands for today. Silvana, it’s time to go home. I need a fighter.”</p><br><p>Silvana smiled faintly.</p><br><p>‘Don’t worry, I’ve already taken care of it. The fighter has taken off from the spire and will arrive shortly.’</p><br><p>Without saying a word, Adam sat down on the nearest rock, staring at the crater that would disappear in a few days, and what remained would become part of the Corrosive Lakes.</p><br><p>Adam understood that this was not Frida’s full power, because these monsters were not Lords.</p><br><p>‘Saegar… I remember how he fought. Most likely, he and Kenward are Lords who can fight on equal terms against the strongest Phantoms. Saegar had no trouble killing several Lords.</p><br><p>‘Could Frida really wipe out the Lords just as easily? Was all she needed to do was create a bigger spear?’</p><br><p>He knew the answers to these questions, and they frightened him, but gradually, Adam was approaching this power himself.</p><br><p>The power of the second ring of his Nexus came as a surprise to him.</p><br><p>What was his fifth spear capable of?</p><br><p>Well, to find the answer to this and many other questions, he needed to create constellations of the Path Construct.</p><br><p>For now, it was time to return home, as the destroyer had already appeared on the horizon, flashing green lights.</p>
