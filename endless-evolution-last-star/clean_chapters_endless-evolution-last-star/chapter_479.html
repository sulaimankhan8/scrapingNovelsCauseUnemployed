            <br><p>The first day of training in the Gray Castle passed after many events.</p><br><p>It was early morning, and the sun was just recently emerging from the horizon line, covering the land with its warm rays, which had gotten used to the night's cold.</p><br><br><p>Dahla walked confidently toward Tron's room. It was now 7:00 AM, early morning and training was going to start in an hour.</p><br><p>Her intentions were unknown, but unlike yesterday, she was dressed in an athletic, tight outfit that wasn't really the most comfortable option.</p><br><p>She stopped in front of the door and took a deep breath before reaching out her hand, about to knock.</p><br><br><br><p>Before she could do so, the door opened, letting out Riska who had not expected to see Dahla here.</p><br><p>They exchanged glances.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Riska was also dressed in a tracksuit, but looser and more comfortable since unlike Dahla, she had no hidden intentions.</p><br><p>"Riska...? Why are you here?" Dahla said uncertainly as she took a step back.</p><br><p>"Hm? In the Gray Castle, I live together with Tron, just as Adam shared with Silvana. You can't not know that." Riska tilted her head in confusion, making an innocent expression.</p><br><p>Dahla shook her head to the side.</p><br><p>"No, that's not what I'm talking about. Doesn't Tron usually go out for a morning jog?"</p><br><p>Riska passed a glance over Dahla's clothes as a sly smirk appeared on her face.</p><br><p>"Oh, I see, so that's why you're dressed like that."</p><br><p>Then, Riska took a step forward, forcing Dahla to step back until her back touched the wall.</p><br><p>Riska raised her hand, leaning against the wall and leaning towards Riska with unknown intentions.</p><br><p>"Well, it's true. Tron usually goes out for a run at this time, and I get up a little later and go for a workout. But..."</p><br><p>Riska whispered as she leaned a little forward, closer to Riska.</p><br><p>"I got Tron a special workout this night, so he'll sleep longer than usual tonight, and I'm full of energy on the contrary. Well, if you know what I'm talking about of course."</p><br><p>Dahla's mouth dropped open slightly and her face turned as red as a tomato as her mind involuntarily began to imagine what was going on behind that door tonight.</p><br><p>"You... you... You pervert!"</p><br><p>Riska only licked her lips in response, not about to release the pressure. She knew what Dahla was thinking and what she wanted, which was why it was so easy to play with her and it brought her enjoyment.</p><br><p>"I'm a pervert? Hufufu, then what about you?"</p><br><p>Riska smirked as he glanced around their room.</p><br><p>"You know, if you want you can come over to our place tonight. I'm not greedy. If it's okay with Tron, it's okay with me too. I'm sure I'll enjoy the show."</p><br><p>At that moment, Dahla's embarrassment reached its limit.</p><br><p>Sure, she was a grown woman, but so was Riska and she had a significant advantage over Dahla.</p><br><p>It seemed that Dahla's face had never been as red as it was now and her body was trembling with embarrassment and arousal at the same time.</p><br><p>Read exclusive chapters at empire</p><br><p>"Have a good run!" Dahla exclaimed before bursting away, running around the corner as fast as she could.</p><br><p>Watching this scene, Riska only giggled, she enjoyed teasing Dahla.</p><br><p>"Well, her embarrassment is understandable, but I wasn't kidding. Everything needs variety from time to time." Riska said calmly, stretching and heading downstairs to the first floor.</p><br><p>There was plenty of space around the Gray Castle where one could both relax amongst nature and take a morning jog to stay in shape.</p><br><br><p>About fifteen minutes later, Adam awoke to a delicious aroma that brought him out of a deep sleep.</p><br><p>He struggled to get out of bed and saw Silvana standing in the kitchen in a white apron in front of the stove.</p><br><p>Hearing a rustle on the bed, Silvana turned around and greeted him with a warm smile on her face.</p><br><p>"Good morning. How did you sleep?"</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head then the corners of his mouth went up.</p><br><p>"Not bad, I haven't slept this soundly in a while." Adam replied as he looked at the working stove, "You know you don't have to cook for me, right? We can always order something, like Tron did yesterday."</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head.</p><br><p>"Eating only this kind of food will bore you quickly. It's only really good the first few times, you need variety in everything, you know? Moreover, there's nothing better than home-cooked food." Silvana replied before returning to cooking with a serious look.</p><br><p>Adam didn't say anything, for a while he watched Silvana cook before moving his gaze to his palm, staring at the ring that Osana had given him.</p><br><p>It was a gift, though for an unconventional reason so Adam didn't want to take it off.</p><br><p>Then, he realized what he wanted to do. To his shame, he'd never really thought about it.</p><br><p>"Silvana, how much more time do you need?"</p><br><p>"About twenty minutes, we'll eat and then we'll start the second training day right away." Silvana replied calmly, focused on her task.</p><br><br><p>"Good, I'll take a walk for now then. I'll be back on time, I promise."</p><br><p>"Sure, don't take too long or the food will get cold."</p><br><br><p>The door closed as Silvana cast a sidelong glance at the already-gone Adam. She bit her lip before turning back to cooking.</p><br><p>Adam entered the elevator and headed to the first floor.</p><br><p>One floor later, his elevator stopped and Max stepped inside.</p><br><p>"Hi." Max said nonchalantly, leaning against the wall and pulling a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket.</p><br><p>"Smoking since the morning?" Adam smirked, "You're not worried about your health at all, are you?"</p><br><p>Max shrugged, lighting a cigarette.</p><br><p>"Well... Pretty soon I won't have to worry about the health problems that ordinary people might face anymore." Max said lighting a cigarette.</p><br><p>Adam gave him a strange look. He didn't understand what Max was talking about.</p><br><p>Then, Adam pulled out his phone, about to look up something important.</p><br><p>"Need a hand?" Max asked idly.</p><br><p>Adam didn't answer right away, eventually, he nodded deeply and looked at Max with determination.</p><br><p>"Max, what gift should I give a woman to make her remember this? I need some advice."</p><br><p>Max glanced at Adam's screen where a random online jewelry store was open.</p><br><p>"Oh, I see..." Max said in a slow voice before exhaling a puff of smoke.</p>
