            <br><p>Prime King's left arm flew off to the side, splattering his dark blood around, under the shocked gazes of both the Travelers Squad and hundreds of Golden Searchers.</p><br><p>It came as a surprise to everyone, for they all knew how strong an opponent Prime King was, for he stood at the top of this area! There were hardly any monsters in Scorching Desert that could match him in might.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, but for Prime King, Adam was probably the worst opponent.</p><br><p>Many people, especially newcomers, didn't understand why the Prime King of the Golden Searchers was so strong, even though the regular Golden Searchers were only White Threat Level Monsters.</p><br><p>Aside from being strong and fast, which didn't make it any different from the others, the Prime King had excellent defense. His dark scales were extremely durable, and if there was any powerful attack, his dense golden wings could protect him.</p><br><p>In fact, in this, Prime King surpassed even the Steel Knight.</p><br><p>After Adam used Thunder Punishment, Steel Knight lost his sword and arm, while Prime King had only damaged a few feathers out of a hundred.</p><br><p>For most Phantoms, Prime King's defense would be a real problem, to deal with it, Phantom would have to spend a lot of time and a bunch of resources, gradually wounding and exhausting Prime King.</p><br><p>However... In Adam's case, things were a bit different.</p><br><p>His First Order didn't have any unique ability, as it was simply a massive sword-sized needle made up of hundreds of silver threads. However, his threads had an additional armor-piercing ability.</p><br><p>It was simple, what Zera could not penetrate with hier scythe, but only scratch, Adam would easily pierce or possibly cut through. This effect was similarly transferred to his Second Order.</p><br><p>Thus, the silver claws passed through Prime King's molten wings without difficulty, ripping out the monster's arm and moving on, straight for his head.</p><br><p>Prime King's eyes went wide. He realized that he had to dodge, or else their fight could end, right now!</p><br><p>However, just as Prime King wanted to bounce back, he realized that he couldn't move. A silver thread from Adam's first grip was twisted around his legs.</p><br><br><p>Adam gripped the Prime King's neck tightly with a cold stare.</p><br><p>'The Steel Knight didn't have a suitable defense to reduce the damage from Thunder Punishment. However, he still found a way, then made me try hard for victory. Well, this just goes to show that Scorching Desert is past its prime. I have to move on.' Adam internally muttered, intending to break Prime King's neck.</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, Prime King's golden hair trembled and headed sharply towards Adam's hand like taut ropes. They curled tightly around his hand, trying to delay the inevitable.</p><br><p>Sure enough, the Prime King was able to make some gains, for no matter how hard Adam tried, he couldn't strengthen his grip. Slowly, his fingers unclenched just a little more, and Prime King would be able to get out of the death clutch.</p><br><br><p>Drops of blood fell to the ground, flowing down Prime King's chest from one wound in the very center. On the other side, a long silver needle covered in blood came out, glistening faintly in the sun, only occasionally showing its value.</p><br><p>Prime King was concentrating too much on Adam's claws, he had completely forgotten that Adam's needle was a fearsome weapon. He didn't have many opportunities to find out for sure, though, except for this one - the first and last.</p><br><br><p>The Prime King collapsed to the ground, kicking up dust slightly and holding onto his chest as if trying to pull something out, but it was already done.</p><br><p>Adam let out a heavy sigh and swung his claws, attacking the three Queens. They watched the scene with horror.</p><br><p>They didn't fight back, and soon, the silver claws cut them into several pieces, allowing Barna and the others to no longer worry about the success of the mission. Without the Queens, there were no more opponents in this Nest that could pose a threat to them.</p><br><p>However, it was unlikely that the Golden Searchers would be fighting anymore. </p><br><p>The Queens didn't even try to dodge Adam's attacks, because once the King died, it was over for them.</p><br><p>Adam had won, and they had lost, and for the monsters, it was just like death. There was no difference.</p><br><p>"Alright, there's no need to be upset, it's better to end quietly than a disaster, isn't it?" Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>Then, a fire lit up in his eyes, for he had accomplished what he had come here for! He not only wanted to fight Prime King to test his skills but because he needed the genes!</p><br><p>Adam dropped the blood from his needle and pointed his hand towards the Prime King, summoning revolve. Soon, five purple genes emerged from the monster's body, entering Adam's space.</p><br><p>[You have obtained the Prime King of the Golden Searchers Genes x5!]</p><br><p>'Only five? Well, that's probably logical, right? If I had gotten seven or even more so ten, then this fight wouldn't make any sense!' Adam pondered over the power of the Prime King.</p><br><p>Prime King was the strongest monster among Golden Searchers and in Scorching Desert, but not the strongest among Purple Threat Level. The same Steel Knight was much higher in the power rankings and was much more dangerous.</p><br><p>At this time, Barna, Katrin, and the others were quickly massacring the remaining Golden Searchers. Without the King, the monsters lost all motivation and hardly fought back, as if the most important thing in their lives was gone.</p><br><p>"Phew, did we really do it?" Katrin muttered, brushing the sweat off her forehead.</p><br><p>"Damn! Adam made it look so easy! Hopefully, soon, I too can fight Prime King and win!" Kody exclaimed with an excited expression.</p><br><p>Barna shook her head with a heavy sigh.</p><br><p>Kody raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"Is something wrong?"</p><br><br><p>"Adam recently defeated a Steel Knight. That monster is stronger than Prime King, so we shouldn't be surprised by his victory, but that doesn't mean Prime King is weak. It's just that K0 and K1 Phantom are completely different levels of power."</p><br><br><p>"Whatever. That doesn't mean I can't aim for the same level. I don't mind evolving slowly, the important thing is the results!" Kody clenched his fist vigorously. There seemed to be no limit to his enthusiasm.</p><br><p>Adam glanced at the Prime King's corpse and touched his earbud.</p><br><p>"Is that it? Mission accomplished?" Adam asked.</p><br><p>'Yes. All the Golden Searchers have been killed.' Silvana calmly replied, 'All you have left to do is...'</p><br><p>"Silvana? Hey, can you hear me?!"</p><br><p>Adam tried to call out to Silvana, but no matter what he did, she didn't answer, for some reason, the connection was cut off.</p><br><p>"Guys... We killed all the monsters, right?" In that case, what is this?" Mark pointed puzzledly at a mechanical sphere floating high in the sky.</p><br><p>Electric vibrations were emitted from the sphere, forming a transparent magnetic dome covering the entire Nest.</p><br><p>The sphere was clearly made with human technology, it was not a monster skill. However, the barrier didn't look like it was protecting against monsters.</p><br><p>It was more like they were caged by someone's will with no connection to the Citadel!</p>
