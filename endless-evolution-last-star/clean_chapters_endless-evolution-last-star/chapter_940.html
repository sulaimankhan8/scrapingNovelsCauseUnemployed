            <br><p>There were fewer Phantoms and people at the Lower Ring than at the Upper Ring, yet it was still a huge number of people, millions.</p><br><p>How did all the Phantoms know about each other then? How did reputations spread?</p><br><p>It was quite simple, apart from the city streets and arenas, the only place the Phantoms could go to demonstrate their strength was the Cave Grid.</p><br><p>The Phantoms at the Lower Ring were much more accurate than those at the Upper Ring. The Cave Grid was huge, but in the end, it was caves, not the expanses of the Dead Lands. The chances of Phantom squads crossing each other were too high.</p><br><p>It was almost impossible to kill someone or do something remarkable and go unnoticed. As soon as something happened, someone saw it and the news spread like wildfire throughout the Lower Ring, first reaching the Phantoms then the common people.</p><br><p>So the guards on the walls already knew about who Adam was. They hardly delved into his past, it wasn't as important as the fact that he came from the Upper Ring and had been talking to one of the Red Bears captains for hours.</p><br><p>They looked at him warily but didn't do anything about it.</p><br><p>He had permission to enter the Cave Grid.</p><br><p>Risha nodded deeply ending the conversation with the guard and turned to Adam.</p><br><p>"Hey! Let's go! We'll be guided at the Red Zone!"</p><br><p>Adam's eyebrow went up. He didn't fully understand what Risha meant but didn't question it.</p><br><p>He would find out soon enough.</p><br><br><p>The gate opened, letting Adam and Risha pass in. They followed the guard, a middle-aged man while two other guards stood by the walls.</p><br><p>'Hmm...' Adam glanced at the guards. 'They don't look like Phantoms. I don't sense any energy from them. They're probably just watchers, not even capable of stopping a K0-Phantom.'</p><br><p>Then, his eyes deepened as he remembered a few ordinary people who didn't seem so.</p><br><p>Andreas, Douglas, the people of the gamma division, the commander who had brought him down - they weren't Phantoms. Neither Adam nor Silvana had any doubts about that.</p><br><p>'Well, I doubt they look like people from the gamma division, but... Orel said there are government people among them. I'm not sure what they're capable of...'</p><br><br><p>Following the guard, Adam and Risha approached the entrance located right in the massive fissure covering the top of the Cave Grid.</p><br><p>Energy crystals protruded from the walls of the passage like junk.</p><br><p>Adam pointed to the protruding crystals. "I thought at the Lower Ring any resources were important. Isn't this too wasteful?"</p><br><p>Without turning around, the man spoke in his low voice.</p><br><p>"There is almost no energy in these crystals, but they shine well. For your information, at the Cave Grid, there are many energy crystals on every level, you can't touch them, they're sources of light."</p><br><p>The man waved his hand. "Not all caves have natural light sources. The city has to run electricity, not only for the lamps, but also to run the elevator, mines, rails, minecarts, and so on. So if there's a way to save time and money on such a complicated job, we do it."</p><br><p>It was clear from Adam's face that he hadn't expected such an answer. It was all logical and pragmatic.</p><br><p>"I see... Hopefully, if I destroy the energy crystals during the battle there won't be any complaints against me?"</p><br><p>"Khm..." the man coughed. "That depends on how much damage is done and which monster will give its life for it. Though considering you're a K3-Phantom, any Red Threat monster is worth a fair amount. We usually only have problems with K0-Phantoms."</p><br><p>"Hm? Why with them specifically?"</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, the man shook his hand. "They just became Phantoms and think they're the rulers of the world now and can do anything. They don't realize that a White Threat Monster isn't valuable enough to destroy an elevator or generators during a fight."</p><br><p>'Hah,' Adam chuckled inwardly. 'In some ways, he's right. But, most of the K0-Phantom at the Lower Ring are still teens, right? I think mostly 14 to 16 year olds... At that age, you just want to win.'</p><br><p>Thinking about it, Adam didn't notice that he wasn't much older than the Phantoms he was talking about. Not considering the events at Heaven Island, he was progressing faster than most.</p><br><p>Soon, they descended and reached the first floor of the Cave Grid, or entered the Peaceful Zone.</p><br><p>A massive iron crate stood in the center - it was the main elevator used by thousands of workers and hundreds of Phantoms every day. The elevator was divided into many sections, like a giant warehouse with a place for everyone.</p><br><p>A railroad ran in all directions from the elevator, running through many caverns stretching far ahead.</p><br><p>Even with his eyesight, Adam saw only darkness in the distance, though everything was lit either by lamps or crystals.</p><br><p>The man was about to enter the elevator area when a bright light fell upon them from the right side.</p><br><p>Several workers were riding on the platform, followed by a row of twenty minecarts full of coal, iron, and copper.</p><br><p>"Hey! Commander Greg, how's it going?" one of the workers waved. His buddies smiled tiredly, pickaxes on their backs.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment seeing what was at the end of the minecarts.</p><br><p>'Oh... Looks like technological advances are visible everywhere, even in the mines, right?'</p><br><p>A massive drill in the distance, more than ten minecarts, slowly halted.</p><br><p>Greg turned to meet the workers' gaze. "Guys, I appreciate your optimism, but you're doing dangerous business drilling mines beyond the borders of the Peaceful Zone. I mean, this place is called that for a reason."</p><br><p>The captain of the workers, a stout man, jumped off the platform and laughed briefly.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, don't worry. We always have a few Phantoms with us who will deal with the monsters in case of trouble. It's the only way to find anything worthwhile on the first floor!"</p><br><p>The man looked at Risha, he nodded deeply in respect. After that, he looked at Adam.</p><br><p>"Hm? Greg, is this a newbie?"</p><br><p>"Well, something like that. But from what I've had time to hear this newbie is far more experienced than many of our veterans."</p>
