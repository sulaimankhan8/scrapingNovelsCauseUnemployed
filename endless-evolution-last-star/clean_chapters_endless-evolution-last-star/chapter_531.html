            <br><p>One of Adam's goals was to learn more about Morton Observatory and especially about Aiden Henk.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, right now he had the best opportunity of all time, his driver was someone who possessed information unavailable to even high-ranking military or experienced Operators.</p><br><p>However, Adam didn't know about it. All he was aware of about Gladius was that this mysterious man was working with Franz and Rosalind.</p><br><p>Adam didn't have any reason to think that Gladius had anything to do with Morton Observatory, much less that he was close to Aiden.</p><br><p>"Forgive my curiosity." Gladius smirked, driving forward confidently, "But, Adam, have you ever been to a wedding before?"</p><br><p>Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>"Nah, this will be the first time. Not that I want to, but we can't control every event in our lives, can we?"</p><br><p>A satisfied gleam passed over Gladius's eyes.</p><br><p>"Oh, you're right. Sometimes one event, or even one action by another person can drastically change another person's life."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, casting Gladius an odd look.</p><br><p>"Khm. I apologize." Gladius coughed, "Let's get back to the wedding. You've never been to a wedding, that said, you'll find yourself at one between the Twelve Branches very soon."</p><br><p>Gladius continued, turning the steering wheel sharply to cut across the road.</p><br><p>"After this, all other weddings will seem pale and lacking in interest. What do you think?"</p><br><p>In response, Adam shrugged nonchalantly, his gaze heading out the window, waiting for this ride to end.</p><br><p>"Well... Most likely so, but not that it'll affect anything."</p><br><br><p>"I don't know if it's good or bad, but I'm not ready for a simple relationship yet, I don't think I'll be thinking about getting married anytime soon."</p><br><p>Gladius waved his hand nonchalantly, showing that Adam's worries were taking place.</p><br><p>"You know, some Phantoms are anxious to get married as soon as possible. Their logic is reasonably straightforward - they know that statistically many of them will die in the next ten or twenty years, so they want to have time to do the important things before that happens."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes narrowed as he frowned.</p><br><p>"What a pessimistic attitude... Moreover, even if I had such a wish, such a momentous event needs a suitable partner, don't you think?"</p><br><p>Gladius's grin grew wider for a moment before his face returned to normal. He nodded deeply and uttered: "I thought the Phantoms always had a matching option nearby. Is your Operator not worthy of your attention?"</p><br><p>Though it was a provocation, Adam didn't realize it. He didn't know if Gladius was a Phantom or a mere human, so he took it as a casual interest.</p><br><p>Adam was embarrassed, and turned around, refusing to answer.</p><br><p>Gladius nodded deeply.</p><br><p>'A satisfactory response. Hehehehe.'</p><br><br><br><p>The car abruptly stopped, the tires leaving a clear mark on the asphalt due to the speed bump.</p><br><p>Gladius opened the door for Adam, he stepped forward, glancing around.</p><br><p>"Here. Franz and Rosalind should be waiting for you there by now." Gladius pointed to the clothing store in front of them, a small building with an old, vintage design.</p><br><p>Adam took the box, a smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Thank you, we got here faster than I expected. You're a great driver."</p><br><p>Gladius leaned against the car, crossed his arms over his chest, and tilted his hat.</p><br><p>"Hah, you know I have a lot of experience in this field, anyway I've been working as a driver for a whole day by now."</p><br><p>Adam smiled awkwardly at the joke before reaching out and opening the door, entering the store.</p><br><p>Gladius didn't bother getting back into his car, instead, he walked across the street even though it was a red light - heading straight for the barbershop.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, this particular barbershop was closed today, though there were no repairs or any emergency events that would cause the owner to lose valuable customers.</p><br><p>Stepping inside, Gladius glanced at the empty chairs, mirrors and headed for the restroom, he took a black case from the table.</p><br><p>Standing in front of the sink, Gladius took off his glasses and washed his face properly. Then, he opened the case and took out a square bottle with white gel.</p><br><br><p>The slime-like gel fell on Gladius's hair, while his hands diligently smeared the gel over his head, careful, methodical motions as if he were taking a shower and using too much shampoo.</p><br><p>Gradually, all the gel disappeared, and his hair became white as snow, reflecting even the dim light of the lamp.</p><br><p>Nodding satisfactorily, Gladius reached into the case once more, pulling out the green lenses that in a few seconds replaced his natural blue eye color.</p><br><p>Then, a hairdryer, various hair styling products, and a change of uniform came into play. His previously disheveled hair was now slicked back, smooth, and tight, a lot of wax and hairspray was used.</p><br><p>The clothes of a cab worker changed to the stylish uniform of a waiter - black pants and boots, a narrow vest, and a white striped shirt along with a bow tie on the collar.</p><br><p>If one were to see Gladius from the outside, one would think he was a skilled barber, his actions quick and precise.</p><br><p>"Alright, it's time to bring the guests some appetizers and glasses of wine." Gladius smirked looking at his reflection in the mirror, it was a completely different person now.</p><br><p>Sure, those who were familiar with him could recognize him based on his height, body proportions as well as facial features, but for this one needed to stare and expect Gladius's arrival.</p><br><p>"But... I'm afraid I can't handle so many guests alone. After all, this is a wedding between two Light Nobles." Gladius chuckled, adjusting his collar, a gleam running through his eyes, "I need an assistant, no... I need a partner!"</p><br><br><p>The wooden door opened a passageway to an office inside the barbershop, hidden from the panoramic windows looking out on the main street.</p><br><p>Inside, a tall girl with crimson to shoulder-length hair and blue eyes sat next to a large desk. She was dressed just like Gladius, in a waiter's uniform.</p><br><p>Her knees were together, her gaze lowered and her breathing slightly rapid showing her agitation.</p><br><p>Hearing someone come in, the girl raised her gaze meeting Gladius's green eyes.</p><br><p>"Is all of this necessary for our mission? I mean... I mean, we'll just be waiters to keep an eye on the situation." The girl asked in a slightly unsure voice. Continue your journey on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>It seemed that she, like Adam, did not know who Gladius really was. After all, to know what was at the top of the Morton Observatory, one must have secret information.</p><br><p>Gladius nodded, leaning his back against the doorway.</p><br><p>"Of course. We don't want the higher nobles to realize we're not exactly their waiters. Don't forget that many of them are Phantoms, and we're mere humans. If they want to, they can get rid of us. With their power, no one can punish them for it."</p><br><br><p>"We should be careful and just watch from the sidelines on Adam."</p><br><p>The girl nodded deeply, pondering what awaited them.</p><br><br><p>Gladius walked over to the girl, echoing with his stiff stride, one of his hands was in his pocket - the other he held out to the girl, wanting to help her stand up.</p><br><p>"Let's go, it won't be long before the presence of servants, including waiters, will be checked. We must not be late, Silvana."</p>
