            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1346: Amber Crystal</strong></p><br><p>Adam had to make a choice, just like in a computer game, where he could choose the level of difficulty for himself.</p><br><p>Mona, as the host, gave him a simple choice — the standard seven colors that every K4-Phantom knew, because they reflected the powers of the monsters they would face on the battlefield and in missions.</p><br><p>However, at the Black Threat Level, the old rules no longer applied.</p><br><p>Among the usual Black Threat Monsters, there were also the Elders, of which there were three different ranks. But what about the Lords?</p><br><p>Even though there was a diverse and strict hierarchy of power among the Lords, they were at the very top of the evolutionary ladder.</p><br><p>If a Phantom was a hunter, then the goal of every Phantom was to defeat a Lord. It was the peak of power and danger.</p><br><p>Sure, if Adam had chosen a white crystal, it wouldn’t mean he would have to fight a White Threat Level monster, and after winning, he would receive a reward from the Silver Beacon.</p><br><p>However, all the crystals Mona showed him were stages he had already gone through. It was a danger he had once faced and was able to overcome, all except one.</p><br><p>“This one!” Adam exclaimed, pointing to the amber crystal.</p><br><p>The Lords, like the Elders, did not have a Threat Level, that is, their own color indicating their level of power, but as in the case of the Black Threat Monsters that were on par with the Elders, of all the colors that remained, only amber could describe the power and greatness that the Lords possessed.</p><br><p>For a moment, Mona stared intently at Adam, as if hoping he would change his mind and she would not have to watch his inglorious death at the White Spire, but she could see from his gaze that his decision was final.</p><br><br><br><br><p>“I hid the amber crystal for a reason. If you really choose this crystal, wanting to go through the most difficult trial from the Silver Beacon, the chances of you surviving are negligible compared to your death.”</p><br><p>Mona’s expression did not change, remaining as indifferent as ever, but her deep voice showed that she would like to save Adam’s life if possible.</p><br><p>“Before I answer, let me ask you something.”</p><br><p>Adam looked around, seeing the same snow-white emptiness that had surrounded him from the beginning.</p><br><p>“If I fight someone, it won’t be your mistress, right? My opponent won’t be the Silver Beacon?”</p><br><p>In fact, Mona had no authority to answer that question, because only the Silver Beacon could decide how Adam’s trials would proceed.</p><br><p>However… she could give him another answer.</p><br><p>“It depends on my mistress. However, few contenders have faced her during their trials. It is a rare privilege.”</p><br><p>Adam’s grin widened as if he had expected to hear that answer.</p><br><p>“Well, then I have nothing to worry about. I thought the Silver Beacon forced the knight to restrain his ambitions, but it seems that’s not the case. She’s just like him.”</p><br><p>Mona’s eyes widened in confusion.</p><br><p>“Agh…? What does that mean?”</p><br><p>In response, Adam poked himself in the chest.</p><br><p>“I won’t lose if my opponents are her servants, subordinates, or something like that. Maybe if I went up against her one-on-one, I wouldn’t sound so confident, but I definitely won’t die!”</p><br><p>The corners of Mona’s lips twitched as she…</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, she laughed like a child who had heard nonsense.</p><br><p>“You really are Adam Vinter, aren’t you? Well, fortunately or unfortunately, you’ve already made your choice, and there’s no way I can change it.”</p><br><p>Without Adam’s actions, the amber crystal trembled and broke into two pieces. One fragment landed in Adam’s palm, turning into a seal, while the other headed for the elevator doors.</p><br><p>A wave of amber energy ran through the elevator, moving straight up into the void.</p><br><p>Then, Mona stepped aside and bowed low with a wave of her hand.</p><br><p>“I wish you luck, Adam. If you can survive choosing the amber crystal, you will surely get what you came here for and, more importantly, you will impress my mistress.”</p><br><p>Adam shrugged and moved forward with a confident stride.</p><br><p>“I’m sorry, but I’m not particularly interested in the approval of the Silver Beacon. I came here to get one thing I need, and she brought me here to get a show or whatever her plans are. In any case, we are partners in this case and nothing more.”</p><br><p>It was bold, but Adam wasn’t afraid of punishment. He understood that the Silver Beacon had to adhere to certain rules, just as he did.</p><br><p>Mona nodded slightly as Adam stepped into the elevator and the doors closed, hiding his confident silhouette.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the elevator shot upward at tremendous speed as energy coursed through the shaft, causing a tremor similar to the one Adam had experienced when teleporting to the Citadel and the Spires.</p><br><p>Mona looked up, watching the bright flash run across the void, which was soon reflected at the top of the Silver Beacon.</p><br><p>“I hope the lady will be pleased. This young man was not the one she expected at the end of this World Wipe, but he has a chance to surpass all the other candidates.”</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, instead of the white light burning at the top of the Silver Beacon, an amber star flashed, bringing a broad grin to Norax’s face.</p><br><p>However, the others did not react so joyfully, for they understood what this meant. All except one.</p><br><p>“Hmm? Amber light? What does that mean…?” Nollura asked, confused.</p><br><p>Misty frowned slightly. “Boss, I hate to say this, but maybe you shouldn’t be happy about it. It’s very bad… Why did the host show him the amber crystal in the first place?”</p><br><p>“Yeah…” Karso nodded deeply with a serious look, which was very rare for him. “This shouldn’t have happened. I expected to see the red or black light, and I wouldn’t have been surprised, but the amber one? Shit, was my first fight against Adam my last?”</p><br><p>Narica gulped in mild horror.</p><br><p>She had never undergone the trials at the Silver Beacon, but as Norax’s maid, she had lived in these lands for hundreds of years and knew practically everything that happened at the Silver Beacon and Forgotten Mills.</p><br><p>“Sir… We should have warned Adam not to do that. I know it would have been against the rules, but couldn’t we have at least hinted to him somehow? If he dies, the Silver Beacon won’t be able to grant your wish.”</p><br><p>However, Norax didn’t want to listen to their opinions. Instead, he waved his hand and stared at Nollura.</p><br><p>“Don’t listen to these pessimists, Nollura. They just don’t understand what they’re talking about. Unlike all of them, you were the only one who fought Adam with the real risk of dying, so you should understand that he will stop at nothing, right?”</p><br><p>Norax leaned forward as a dark aura emanated from his body, momentarily engulfing the entire space around him, leaving only his purple eyes shining brightly in the darkness.</p><br><p>“Yes, if you hadn’t appeared before his arrival and given me the seal, Adam would definitely have killed me. You told me that he trained for a long time in your mill, but…”</p><br><p>Nollura lowered her gaze before raising it as her eyes widened.</p><br><p>“I don’t think he was serious. After all, none of you were going to kill him for real, and the Silver Beacon will do it without hesitation. That’s what I understood.”</p><br><p>In response, Norax’s smirk widened as he nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“Yeah, you get it, Nollura, and that’s why Adam will win, you can be sure of that.”</p><br><p>The others didn’t agree with Norax, but in this he was like Adam, always willing to bet big no matter what it cost if the reward on the other side was worth it.</p><br><p>Shrugging, Norax put his feet up on the table, staring intently at the night sky where an unusual amber star appeared for a moment, crossing vast distances in a fraction of a second.</p><br><p>“Unfortunately, we can’t see what he’s going through, but Adam is no ordinary human, and you’ll soon see that for yourself. Hahaha, it’s not for nothing that the Befallen Crown decided he was a Stellar Phantom! He’s a real threat to all monsters, and that’s why we’re helping him!”</p><br><p>Misty’s face darkened, Narica continued to fidget, and only Karso’s frown gradually became more cheerful. He couldn’t hide his desire to know if Adam would make it out of the Silver Beacon alive.</p><br><br><p>At that moment, the bright light finally stopped blinding Adam as he opened his eyes.</p><br><br><p>A powerful gust of wind blew over him as he saw a huge, destroyed bridge in front of him.</p><br><p>“What the hell is this?” He slowly raised his head with a trembling gaze.</p><br><p>In the distance, a majestic spire rose, its top disappearing into the void, hidden from Adam’s gaze.</p><br><p>Hundreds of creatures with broad silver wings, resembling gargoyles, flew around the White Spire. There were so many of them that their wings obscured the bright light falling on the bridge and its ruined parts.</p><br><p>In the distance, a gate was visible, with one fang-shaped piece missing.</p><br><p>Only one gargoyle had a fang, and unfortunately for Adam.</p><br><p>He had no chance of defeating that one, for it was the consequence of his choice.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Adam’s body when a great monster with wide wings flew out from under the bridge, significantly larger than all the others. The silver gargoyle’s eyes glowed with a bright, amber light.</p><br><p>But it wasn’t that which frightened Adam, but the gargoyle’s aura, which was rapidly growing, moving from the White Threat Level to green, blue, purple, and beyond, until it reached the limit of the Black Threat Level.</p><br><p>Then, its eyes shone brightly and the aura continued to grow, reminding Adam of his decision.</p><br><p>He chose the amber crystal, which meant he chose the power of the Lords.</p><br><p>“F-Fuck…” Adam clenched his fists when he realized what he had done.</p>
