            <br><p>Silvana as well as Adam quickly realized what the matter was. Two nobles were going to fight right in the middle of the largest restaurant, and at the Amber Cloud there was plenty of room for that.</p><br><p>"Hey, Adam..." Silvana stammered, "We can leave right now, a few minutes and we'll be in another restaurant. I'm afraid it'll be too late later."</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam's eyes were running, from one side to the other. He scrutinized the combatants and the crowd's reaction, wanting to know how serious it was.</p><br><p>Before Adam could give a response, a waiter, a girl with a long braid going to her waist, approached them like any other guest.</p><br><p>"Hello, nice to welcome you at the Amber Cloud, are you ready to order now or should I come back later?"</p><br><br><p>"No, sorry, actually we were just leaving-"</p><br><p>Before she could finish her sentence, Adam touched her shoulder, lowering her down to a chair. Then, he shot a look at the girl, hunger roaming in his eyes.</p><br><p>"Sure, meat, fish, fruits and vegetables, pastries and sweets, bring anything that can fulfill my hunger. It feels like I haven't eaten in years, so I'll make the most of this opportunity."</p><br><p>For a moment the girl's face reflected doubt, but... once she took a closer view of Adam, of his exhausted body, she smiled weakly.</p><br><p>"As you say, in that case, I'll try to prepare a feast for you, I won't forget the drinks you don't have to worry about it."</p><br><p>"Good, before you go, I have one question."</p><br><p>The girl gave him a questioning look.</p><br><br><p>Adam jerked his head in the direction of two approaching silhouettes. They were moving towards the empty center, there were no tables or decorations.</p><br><p>"Oh, it seems you arrived at the Twilight Palace only recently, right?"</p><br><p>In response, Adam only raised an eyebrow, wanting the waitress to continue. She didn't keep him waiting long, excitedly she proceeded to explain.</p><br><p>"The Amber Cloud is located in one of the most crowded spots of the Twilight Palace, so due to that factor and its size, this restaurant has unintentionally become a popular place for duels. I'm sure one will be coming here very soon."</p><br><br><p>One word was all Adam had time for before the waitress beat him to it.</p><br><p>"The safety of the guests is ensured by a barrier from the External Artifact, its parts installed in all important places."</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam grumbled, leaning back in the padded back of his chair, "In that case, I have no more questions. Hurry up and get my order to the chefs."</p><br><br><p>The girl bowed respectfully and hurried into the kitchen.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana glanced over at each other. She stared into the back of the receding waitress as her lips came into motion expressing her suspicions.</p><br><p>"You noticed that too?"</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, she's a simple person, but she knows a hell of a lot. I'm sure in the time she's been working here she's learned secrets not available to people elsewhere. It's like we're in another world."</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Silvana mused glancing around the seemingly endless passageways and high walls, "Well, that's not far from the truth. This place has its own rules, currency, and values with roles. I doubt that for the higher nobles, a few people who know more about the Dead Lands than others are a problem."</p><br><p>With a focused gaze, Adam looked at the two fighters reaching their arena in the center of the restaurant.</p><br><p>On the right was a girl with shoulder-length gray hair and the same eyes. Formal blue and white clothes covered her body like a princess of a warring kingdom.</p><br><p>Her gaze, her posture, and even the way her chin was raised high - everything indicated her immense pride in her name and belonging to her family.</p><br><p>Opposite her was a tall young man with short, spiky black hair and eyes as dark as two bottomless abysses. Unlike his opponent, he didn't look like someone noble at all.</p><br><p>His white loose shirt was open revealing his steel abs and large muscles all over his body ready to quiver at any exertion. Black wide pants and a massive leather belt were the last elements of his outfit, for he had no shoes.</p><br><p>It was his choice, his bare feet fitting snugly against the white marble reflecting the bright light from the luxurious chandeliers.</p><br><p>Did they look like opposites of each other?</p><br><br><p>The difference in their appearance certainly created a contrast, but that wasn't what Adam was paying attention to.</p><br><p>He stared intently at their looks, comparing them to each other.</p><br><p>'Oh, both serious and ready for battle. I don't know what happened between them, but they're clearly determined to win. However...'</p><br><p>Adam noticed the fiery gazes of the spectators, all of them were nobles who came to the Twilight Palace for one thing only - to win.</p><br><p>'They all have the same goal.'</p><br><p>A sly smirk reflected on Adam's face as he inwardly waved his hand.</p><br><p>'Isn't this the perfect situation for me? They want to win and I want to lose. Hah, perfect match.'</p><br><p>Neither the girl nor the young man said anything, they just stared at each other intently. Whispers passed through the crowd, the food and drinks took a second place to the discussion of the future fight.</p><br><p>What were they waiting for?</p><br><p>Well, any fight at the Twilight Palace had to be official, at least one where the stakes were the twilight coins. Only one person could approve the fight and take bets.</p><br><br><p>Less than a minute later, quiet footsteps sounded from outside. This time it was a single silhouette because that was all it took for the fight to begin.</p><br><p>A man wearing the same clothes as the girl, observer No. 6, was moving towards them. In his left hand was a long black case, and another but much smaller one in his right.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment. He immediately realized what was in the cases.</p><br><p>'I see, I kept wondering where their nexuses are. I thought their nexuses were the same as mine or that Lorenzo Family guy's, but it looks like the administration is handling it.'</p><br><p>Soon, the man stopped a sly smile on his face.</p><br><p>"My apologies, I'm late. The observer No. 8, arrived and is ready to host your battle, my dear nobles."</p>
