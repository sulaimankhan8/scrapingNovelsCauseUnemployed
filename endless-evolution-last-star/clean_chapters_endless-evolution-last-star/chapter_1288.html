            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1288: Fury Flower (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Soon, at the wind plain, the area where Ureyn’s mill was located, many monsters would gather to watch the String Duel—a rare event in these lands, especially when Phantom was fighting a monster.</p><br><p>However, if Adam dies before that, there will be no duel, and Gareyna came here for that very reason.</p><br><p>“It wasn’t supposed to be like this, young man.”</p><br><p>Gareyna clenched her fists as the threads swirled around her, taking the form of two ghosts with claws as sharp as blades.</p><br><p>“Ureyn cannot surpass his level if he fights only for victory. The pure rage at the sight of Nollura’s head in your hand should have been the impetus that helped him break through the next barrier. BUT!”</p><br><p>She gritted her teeth in anger, staring intently at Nollura, wanting to incinerate her with a single glance.</p><br><p>“That stupid bitch isn’t even good enough to die for a great cause!”</p><br><p>Nollura trembled with fear, unable to say anything even if she wanted to. She understood that nothing was stopping Gareyna from killing her right here and now. That would surely happen unless a miracle occurred and Gareyna changed her mind.</p><br><p>Unlike her, Adam remained calmer.</p><br><p>He crossed his arms over his chest and shrugged.</p><br><p>“You’re wrong. How did you even get to your level thinking that way?”</p><br><p>“What? What are you talking about, you little bastard?!” Gareyna’s veins bulged in her face.</p><br><p>“Isn’t it obvious?” Adam lifted his chin. “I’m talking about anger. Even if Ureyn had defeated me in anger or, conversely, kept it as motivation after defeat, it would only have given him a short-term boost. Ultimately, it would have consumed him and led to defeat.”</p><br><p>“Bullshit! Pure rage is one of the best ways to become stronger! I know this better than most!”</p><br><p>Her eyes reddened. There was almost nothing left of the calm Gareyna who had offered Adam tea and told him about the Forgotten Mills. She seemed to have become a different person, which was not far from the truth, because during their conversation at the mill, she thought she had everything under control.</p><br><p>“Tsk, why am I even justifying myself to you? In any case, there won’t be any fight. You could have accidentally died before reaching Ureyn’s mill, couldn’t you?” Gareyna smirked as she looked at Nollura. “And you… I should have gotten rid of you a long time ago, you filthy spider!”</p><br><br><p>Under Gareyna’s angry shout, the thread ghosts rushed forward, moving straight towards Adam and Nollura.</p><br><p>Despite Adam’s brave words, he had no way to defend himself, let alone help Nollura.</p><br><p>‘Fuck! She actually did it!’</p><br><p>Silvana’s face turned pale as she tried to come up with a plan to somehow save Adam, but… there was too little time.</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, before tearing Adam and Nollura to pieces, the thread ghosts stopped for some reason.</p><br><p>Not only them, but Adam and Nollura as well. One word from an unknown person had such power that it froze a K4-Phantom and a Black Threat Level monster.</p><br><p>Only Gareyna retained control of her body, but that wasn’t exactly good news for her.</p><br><p>“You…” She hissed, looking at the man in the black coat who seemed to have appeared out of nowhere on the wind plain.</p><br><p>The cold wind ruffled his disheveled hair, and his purple eyes seemed to be able to see into the soul of any creature.</p><br><p>“Hello, Gareyna. Long time no see, isn’t it?” Norax smirked. He knew that his appearance was the worst-case scenario for Gareyna and sincerely enjoyed it.</p><br><p>Gareyna clenched her fists.</p><br><p>“Tsk, I knew it was you, but I hoped someone else was involved. Why did you do that, Norax?! It was my business and my plan from the beginning! That young man, that Arachne and Ureyn! Everything was calculated and would have worked perfectly if it weren’t for you!”</p><br><p>Norax’s eyes flashed.</p><br><p>“Hah, that’s exactly why I did it. Isn’t it obvious, Gareyna, the Fury Flower?”</p><br><p>As soon as Norax’s last words were spoken, Gareyna’s eyes widened in anger, unlike anything seen before.</p><br><p>She couldn’t stand it when someone used her title, because it revealed who she really was and the days for which she had earned her title. It was a past she was not proud of, but one that would remain with her forever.</p><br><p>Gareyna was one of those people who wanted to be a person with certain qualities, wanted to appear that way to others, even though she was actually the complete opposite.</p><br><p>“YOU! Norax, even if it’s you, that doesn’t mean you can address me by my title!” Gareyna exclaimed as her white threads created several large monsters around her.</p><br><p>At that moment, the corners of Norax’s lips curved upward, a glimpse of a devious smirk.</p><br><p>“Or what? Maybe you can scare a K4-Phantom and some Arachne. But do you really think you stand a chance against me?”</p><br><p>However, instead of answering, Gareyna’s aura only grew significantly stronger.</p><br><p>Then, among her white flames, Adam noticed a rich red color that grew more intense with each of Gareyna’s hot breaths.</p><br><p>Her heart beat rapidly with rage as her mind no longer had priority in her control.</p><br><p>All Gareyna wanted now was to get rid of Norax, because with him gone, countless problems would disappear from her life.</p><br><p>The white threads continued to create warriors around Gareyna until a real army appeared next to her — consisting entirely of her energy.</p><br><p>“Shut up, you arrogant bastard! Just because you’re from the Black Cut doesn’t make you better than others! You’re just as much a Lord as I am! Don’t you dare disrespect me!”</p><br><p>Gareyna threw out her hand as dozens of creatures, each powerful enough to kill Nollura, rushed forward to attack Norax.</p><br><p>“No, you’re wrong.” Norax shook his head. “I’m better than you—it’s that simple.”</p><br><p>Adam gulped as he watched their battle and wondered what Norax would do.</p><br><br><p>Norax stepped forward as he casually waved his arm just once. Black particles followed his wave.</p><br><br><p>Gareyna’s entire army fell to the ground, cut in two, along with her right arm, flooding the ground with white threads and dark, hot blood.</p>
