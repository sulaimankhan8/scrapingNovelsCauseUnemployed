            <br><p>Adam went through many dangerous battles, he defeated many powerful opponents, and every fight, ordinary and great, had a beginning.</p><br><p>However, not once did his fight not start with a simple conversation. Moreover, the mysterious monster in front of him was not aggressive or vicious, on the contrary, the man acted calmly and even somewhat respectfully.</p><br><p>He wasted no opportunity to point out Adam's inferior status, to show his arrogance and grandeur, but that was what any worthy ruler would do in front of his servant.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes reflected white runes floating amongst the starry mist, he could sense that it was energy, but he had never before seen it in such a guise. It was definitely not a monster ability, Adam could sense that.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, the man nodded meaningfully as he clenched his hand into a fist and abruptly unfolded it in his palm, the mist along with the runes dissipated.</p><br><p>"I see... You asked about my name, but I'm afraid I would be embarrassing myself if I let a mere servant address me by my name."</p><br><p>The man stared at Adam for a brief moment, his voice echoing through the temple once more.</p><br><p>"I think we can agree that I will tell you of my title. After all, most weak monsters only have that."</p><br><br><p>With a wave of his hand, the man majestically proclaimed:</p><br><p>"Hear my title, and don't you dare forget, remember until the last second of your life, be it short or long."</p><br><p>The man clenched his fist tightly, his eyes, bloody rubies, grew deeper.</p><br><p>"My title is the Monarch of Crimson Thunder!"</p><br><p>The monsters' fear increased, they didn't dare even look at the Crimson Monarch, but Adam didn't see that as a problem. He continued to maintain his silence, expecting Silvana to be able to find information on this monster's 'name', but there was not a sound from the other side.</p><br><p>After a long pause, the Crimson Monarch lowered his hand and directed his gaze at a human in front of him.</p><br><p>"Now, I am waiting for answers. My patience is running out. Kneel before me if you are my servant."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch pointed to the ground, expecting Adam to obey immediately.</p><br><p>Adam took a deep breath.</p><br><p>"I wish you had told me your name, I would be curious to hear it."</p><br><p>After a moment, he added, touching his chest.</p><br><p>"Unlike you, I don't see anything wrong with it - my name is Adam Vinter."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch frowned, his irritation gradually growing. He was patient, but everything had a limit.</p><br><p>"That was not the question I asked you. I'm not interested in your name, you're my servant, that's enough for me."</p><br><p>With a nonchalant expression, Adam shrugged.</p><br><p>"I'm just trying to be polite since I'm neither your servant nor your ally."</p><br><p>Before the Crimson Monarch could react in any way, Adam's right hand turned into a shadow.</p><br><p>In the next moment, the Crimson Monarch's eyes reflected a silver flash, followed by a bright flame.</p><br><p>The speed was impressive, nor did the Crimson Monarch expect that Adam, the one who was supposedly his servant, would suddenly attack him?</p><br><p>Yet, out of the thousands of monsters and several strong creatures in that area, only the Crimson Monarch was fast enough to dodge or block Adam's attack.</p><br><p>"How silly. However, after I heard your first question I should realize that intelligence isn't your strong side."</p><br><p>Without worrying for his life, the Crimson Monarch raised his right hand, going to block Adam's needle.</p><br><p>A dense unrivaled energy headed towards his palm, the Crimson Monarch used the energy control, just as Adam as well as the Dormant Lord did.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>An invisible dense layer covered the Crimson Monarch's skin, stopping the sharp blade a few millimeters from its target.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's eyes turned to the right, eager to see Adam's confused expression, consumed by fear.</p><br><p>Yet, only a sparkling gleam reflected in the corner of his left eye.</p><br><br><p>Streams of bright red blood, each drop resembling a precious stone, rushed between Adam and the Crimson Monarch, even his blood was different from that of ordinary, weak monsters.</p><br><p>Then Crimson Monarch's eyes went wide for a moment, full of bewilderment, he didn't understand how a simple attack by a servant could damage him.</p><br><p>Turning around, he saw a wide cut on his palm, if not for the dense layer of energy, a single needle slash would be enough to leave the Crimson Monarch without four fingers and half of his hand.</p><br><p>From the side came Adam's mocking voice:</p><br><p>"You called me stupid, but it's not like you're smart. You just decided to stop my weapon with your hand, that was arrogant."</p><br><p>"That wasn't bad..." he said slowly, "Looks like I was wrong all along, you're not a servant."</p><br><p>In the next second, the Crimson Monarch closed his eyes as the blood flowing from the cut came into motion. It quickly returned to the damaged flesh, in the blink of an eye there was no trace left of the deep slash.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils narrowed. This was different from the powerful effects of energy regeneration, the Crimson Monarch healed himself.</p><br><p>'So he possesses regeneration? I don't know if it was expected considering the place he appeared in, but... now I realize I'm in big trouble.'</p><br><p>Before, he always had an advantage over any monster he went into battle against - information. Thanks to Silvana and an immense database, Adam knew practically everything about every single one of his opponents.</p><br><p>Even the monsters in the temple didn't pose much of a problem for Adam, since they got their abilities from energy and Voracious Krigias, otherwise Silvana's data wasn't wrong.</p><br><p>But... Adam didn't know anything about the Crimson Monarch, nor was the monster familiar with Adam's abilities.</p><br><p>In a way, this was the first time Adam and the monster were on equal terms.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch directed his gaze to the flames on Adam's needle and his legs.</p><br><p>"That flame, it doesn't belong to you."</p><br><p>Before Adam could answer, the Crimson Monarch nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yes... It's a local External Artifact, it trembles in fear before me. How curious."</p><br><p>With a short sigh, the Crimson Monarch stepped forward, its lone wing open.</p><br><p>"Well Adam Vinter, I will give you the honor to be my first victim upon my awakening. I'll make this quick."</p>
