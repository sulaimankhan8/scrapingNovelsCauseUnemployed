            <br><p>"What the hell...?" Oskar muttered in disbelief, looking at Fog Hunter who was actively squirming on the ground, as if he had been overtaken by a deadly disease capable of killing in seconds.</p><br><p>Fog Hunter's body wriggled and shook, his claws scraping on the ground as if trying to cope with the pain that was developing inside his chest, growing stronger by the moment.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper, the one who had done this to Fog Hunter just watched as his victim wriggled in agony before his imminent death. His face remained the same emotionless and his posture didn't change.</p><br><p>He seemed to be showing that the fact that he had to attack was already too much of an honor for someone like Fog Hunter.</p><br><br><p>Soon, Fog Hunter stopped moving, his suffering coming to an end. After his death, his skin became considerably paler, and his lean and muscular body dried up a lot, becoming weak and useless.</p><br><p>"Silvana... What the hell was that?" Adam asked in a trembling voice, "It's not like he did anything. All he did was open his mouth and... that black air... What was that?"</p><br><p>Though Silvana was far away in the Citadel and safe, it was only now that she was able to partially regain her senses.</p><br><p>'Fine, calm down, I have to help Adam now. This is indeed a real crisis and I have to stay focused. After all, Adam is in danger not me.' Silvana internally said before taking a deep breath.</p><br><p>Then, she opened her eyes with a calm and confident look, going to help her Phantom.</p><br><p>'Adam, there is nothing strange or unusual about this, for he is a Plague Reaper. That black air, that's his deadly breath. If you or anyone breathes that air, the same thing will happen to you as it did to Fog Hunter.' Silvana explained.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Adam was not worried at all, even though Silvana had told of something truly horrible.</p><br><p>She literally said that Plague Reaper could kill them with his breath. However, Silvana did it calmly and confidently. Her voice magically helped Adam keep his mind collected.</p><br><p>'It's dangerous, but the radius of this attack is small and he won't be able to repeat it too often. Moreover, you have a trump card against this creepy ability.' Silvana said with a slight smile.</p><br><p>"Agh, even though it's fucked up and we're in the middle of it, we're lucky in some ways."</p><br><p>Osana said suddenly as the corners of her lips went up.</p><br><p>Silvana was addressing Adam, but she was speaking into the general channel so that everyone else could hear her as well. So Osana had no trouble understanding exactly what Silvana was talking about in the last message.</p><br><p>"Looks like we won't be able to leave here without a fight. Fog Hunter died too quickly. He didn't have any defense against Plague Reaper's death breath. Moreover, Fog Hunter came so close to him like an idiot." Osana smirked before gripping her staff tightly.</p><br><p>Then, her eyes shone brightly and she slammed the staff against the ground, raising up blue streams of wind.</p><br><p>Adam and Katrin glanced around in confusion. They didn't understand what was happening because unlike Oskar, Lero, and Erla they had never seen Osana use this ability before.</p><br><p>Then, multiple streams of wind split into six whirlwinds that descended on each of them coming closer and closer to their bodies.</p><br><p>Soon, the blue wind became almost invisible and was more like a blue glow that like a veil enveloped each of them.</p><br><p>"Oh, what a nice feeling." Adam muttered feeling fresh as if he was high up in the mountains filled with plants and powerful trees.</p><br><br><p>"It's not exactly amplification like my other ability or Katrin's roots, so you Adam won't feel too much pressure from it." Osana said calmly.</p><br><p>She realized that Adam's body was already at its limit. He was carrying three reinforcements on him at once and it was dangerous to put his body under even more pressure. She explained this to him so he wouldn't worry. Osana, as an experienced support, understood well how it worked.</p><br><p>"This wind makes you slightly faster, increases your stamina a bit, and also speeds up the regeneration of weak wounds, and can protect you from minor attacks. For example, if someone throws a rock at you it will just fly aside." Osana quickly explained.</p><br><p>To their luck, Plague Reaper was in no hurry to act. He seemed to prefer to wait for his victims to make the first move, it was more interesting that way. He had enough patience for that.</p><br><p>"But, that's not the most important thing. I usually used this ability when we fought against monsters with poisons. This wind can protect against a toxic cloud or something like that." Osana said confidently, glancing at the already dead Fog Hunter.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide as a satisfied smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam muttered looking at his hand around which a blue wind occasionally passed, "It's a general enhancement and it can protect us from the dark air."</p><br><br><p>"Yes, but I don't advise anyone to get that close to Plague Reaper. My wind should protect you from his deadly breath, but that is only an untested theory. None of us have fought such a dangerous opponent before."</p><br><p>"Wait!" Oskar exclaimed finding himself almost in a panic.</p><br><p>Everyone looked at him puzzled. He looked strange, his fingertips were trembling, sweat came out on his forehead, and there was only fear and uncertainty in his eyes.</p><br><p>"Do you really want to fight that monster?! It's a Plague Reaper! It's a Top-1! Look, the gate is still open, the monsters are still afraid to move, and we can still escape from here!" Oskar exclaimed with a wave of his hand.</p><br><p>Osana frowned, she clearly didn't like Oskar's reaction. Erla and Lero were baffled, and Adam and Katrin glanced around, trying to make a quick decision.</p><br><p>But... They had all forgotten something. In Fume Cathedral, the power was not theirs. The one who sat on the Fume Throne was in charge.</p><br><p>Even though Fume Throne had not yet channeled its energy to its new lord, Plague Reaper had full authority to do what he wanted. Everything that related to Fume Cathedral was under his will.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly there was a snap, a simple but ringing echo spreading around.</p><br><p>Everyone abruptly turned their heads toward the throne, only to see Plague Reaper, who had just snapped his fingers.</p><br><br><p>All of the Fume Armors and Fume Judge looked in his direction, then their gazes traveled towards the gate.</p><br><p>There were three gates in the Fume Cathedral, a massive one in front of the entrance and two side gates on the far end. Next to each gate were Fume Statues.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, everyone felt the ground shake, not like an earthquake, but like the powerful footsteps of massive beings resembling giants.</p><br><p>Then, long shadows fell across the entrances in front of the gate before the Fume Statues began to slowly close the gate.</p><br><p>Perhaps if Adam wanted to, or some monster fast enough, he might be able to run outside in time, but he just stood there and watched as the gate slowly closed.</p><br><br><p>In a few seconds, all the gates were tightly sealed, showing that this place was now their prison, their cage in which no one was destined to survive.</p>
