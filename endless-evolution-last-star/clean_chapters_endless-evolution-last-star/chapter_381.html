            <br><p>Evolution Tree was the foundation of the power of both Phantoms and monsters. However, the process of its appearance as well as the stages of development were different.</p><br><p>This was clearly seen in the case of Gray Stalkers and Plague Reaper. They were at different levels, but since Gray Stalkers were one of the weakest members of their Threat Level, they had only their fangs and claws as weapons.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper, in contrast, had not just unique abilities and formidable weapons but also a sharp intellect and a majestic aura, as well as an intimidating quality of his skills.</p><br><p>Sure, it wasn't always the presence of abilities and their variety that showed a monster's power, nor vice versa, there were exceptions and they were usually frightening.</p><br><p>Nevertheless, not a single Phantom seeing Gray Stalkers, even without knowing their true strength, would consider them something dangerous, they had no formidable auras, no unique abilities, or any horrific physical attributes.</p><br><p>Phantoms also differed in strength level, there was a clear definition for this depending on the Keys.</p><br><p>However, each Phantom had abilities, both K0-Phantom and K3-Phantom, their strength and number could vary, but there was no situation where a new K1-Phantom had only physical force or immediately became the strongest of its level as would happen if Plague Reaper evolved by absorbing Midnight Crystal's energy.</p><br><p>So, it was logical to assume that the Hybrids as a race also had their unique path of power, it could be the same as the Phantoms, completely different or very similar to the monster path since the Hybrids were part monsters.</p><br><p>There was no way to verify it, since at the moment, according to the information available to the Citadel, Nessa was the only Hybrid in existence.</p><br><p>And... the one who had created her, Magnus Zephyr, had no way of repeating his success.</p><br><p>He tried to create a new Hybrid, but for a long time, it became a secondary goal for him. First and foremost, Magnus wanted to help Nessa become stronger, to help her evolve on her path, the path of the Hybrid.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, even though Magnus was one of the smartest people in the entire Citadel, he couldn't know what the next stages of development were for Nessa. He could only make sure that she was using her current powers to their fullest.</p><br><p>Discover stories with empire</p><br><p>So, when Nessa stopped going crazy like some wild beast and reached adulthood, Magnus created a training program for her so that she would learn to use her physical might like a fighter instead of a beast.</p><br><p>Physical strength must be used properly, especially with an anthropomorphic build. This was one of the reasons why Crown Types were so strong, as they had mastered the capabilities of their bodies to the limit.</p><br><p>As a result, Nessa was able to easily defeat White Threat level monsters and most Green Threat ones.</p><br><p>Then, as she barely won in difficult, near-death battles, her muscles grew tighter and her instincts sharper as her combat experience expanded.</p><br><p>When Nessa's body reached its peak and was unlikely to get any stronger due to muscle alone, she could defeat Blue and Purple Threat Level monsters, but the strongest of them was too much for her.</p><br><p>Magnus thought about what needed to be done next, but... Adam and a random series of events did all the work for him. Magnus just wanted to see what Nessa could do against Snow Follower, but in the end, she finally got access to energy.</p><br><p>But, her combat form was more like a Resonance that Phantoms could go into in critical situations than an ability. Furthermore, Nessa had energy only during her battle form, and that energy had very limited uses.</p><br><p>Her energy simply increased her physical capabilities to a new height.</p><br><p>At this level, Nessa could already fight all Purple Threat monsters and even defeat Light Yellow ones without any difficulty.</p><br><p>Magnus hoped to see the next stage of Nessa's development when she absorbed the energy from Midnight Crystal and his expectations proved to be true.</p><br><p>After a long time, going through hundreds of different fights and becoming much stronger, Nessa finally got her Evolution Tree.</p><br><br><p>What was that amber star occupying a spot right in the center of her Evolution Tree?</p><br><p>"No way... Is that his tooth?" Nessa muttered in disbelief, staring at Adam's tooth that just a few seconds ago was firmly clenched in her fist.</p><br><br><p>She wasn't quite sure what she was feeling. She knew that the center of the Evolution Tree was supposed to be the Initial Gene, but... only for Phantoms, it worked that way.</p><br><p>The monsters were different. They had an Evolution Tree too, but unlike the Phantoms, they didn't take genes from anyone, their power came from another principle.</p><br><p>So, Nessa watched in confusion as the amber star became part of her Evolution Tree, as Adam's tooth ceased to be a physical object and was now a blob of energy possessed by Nessa.</p><br><p>The situation was unusual, but that was the way it was supposed to be. She was a Hybrid and no one, including her, knew what to expect from her path of power.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Evolution Tree shuddered as the amber star finally became a core as if imitating the behavior of the Initial Genes, though it wasn't.</p><br><p>[Your Catalyst has become part of your Evolution Tree.]</p><br><p>[Catalyst - Fang of Despair.]</p><br><p>Nessa's mind filled with a strange mechanical sound, no... it was more like a voice, but devoid of features, tone, and emotion, making it seem so detached.</p><br><p>It was something new to Nessa, something that generated within her an unforgettable sensation of delight and excitement, with a twinge of fear of the enchanting unknown.</p><br><p>But, if any Phantom heard that voice, he would not be surprised at all.</p><br><p>The newbie Phantoms didn't think about it, but sooner or later they all realized the simple truth.</p><br><p>That voice was not some deity or entity from another dimension, it was the will of the Evolution Tree, appearing only at particularly important moments for the Phantom's progress.</p><br><p>Its will told the Phantoms what they needed to do to become stronger, which was why the Phantoms knew exactly what was necessary to create the First Key.</p><br><p>"Hahaha... This is actually happening...?"</p><br><p>Nessa muttered with a pleased smile on her face.</p><br><p>The first two messages were not the only ones Nessa heard. The following ones continued to fill her mind like a divine whisper bringing secrets to her new powers.</p><br><p>After an unknown period, Nessa smiled slightly and closed her eyes, falling into a deep sleep.</p><br><p>She never felt better and all she wanted now was to rest before showing the world her new abilities.</p><br><br><br><p>Osana came out behind Midnight Crystal, looking intently at Adam, and Nessa lying unconscious on the ground.</p><br><p>"Are you two alright? I heard you two arguing about something."</p><br><p>Osana narrowed her eyes.</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a bitter smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Yeah... It's alright. Looks like she was more tired than us and fell asleep, though considering her wounds it's not surprising."</p><br><p>Osana cast a suspicious glance at him.</p><br><p>"I hope she had time to absorb the energy from Midnight Crystal?"</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head awkwardly.</p><br><p>"Sure. She did just now!"</p><br><p>"Good." Osana nodded.</p><br><p>Before walking away she threw a quick eye at him.</p><br><p>"Looks like it's your turn now, doesn't it?"</p><br><p>Adam's eyes grew deeper.</p><br><p>"Right... It's time to get the last piece for the Key finally..." Adam gulped.</p>
