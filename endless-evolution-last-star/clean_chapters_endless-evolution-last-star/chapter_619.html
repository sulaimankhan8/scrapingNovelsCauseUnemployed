            <br><p>Oddly enough, of the two girls who went out for a breath of fresh air in the park, only Osana returned. Explore more at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>She joined Leona and Arayna, occasionally discussing something.</p><br><p>The only one who was alone at that moment, besides Silvana, was Gary. He was looking curiously at what was in the buffet, trying to find something unusual, something he hadn't tried.</p><br><p>No one was watching them or restricting them, the military department's budget was huge, and they wouldn't skimp on food for the Phantoms who awakened after a long treatment.</p><br><p>After practically an eternity, Adam put aside his fork and knife and took a deep breath.</p><br><p>"Fuck... I can't take it anymore."</p><br><p>His gaze was directed upward, feeling that if he ate one more bite he would just explode.</p><br><p>In response, Fromund smirked slyly.</p><br><p>"Hah, weakling. I could easily eat twice as much as you."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam frowned, "You haven't eaten anything in a few minutes!"</p><br><p>For a moment Fromund froze, then he waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"I was just taking a break, no big deal. Unlike you, I know how to enjoy my food and I'm in no hurry to get anywhere."</p><br><p>"Pfffft!" Adam rolled his eyes, "You just realized you couldn't beat me and started making up excuses!"</p><br><p>A slight smile appeared on Fromund's face, his eyes darting away.</p><br><p>After a few moments of silence, they came to the same conclusion.</p><br><p>"It's time to go home, isn't it?" Adam sighed.</p><br><br><p>Fromund shrugged, slowly rising from his chair.</p><br><p>"That was a great fight Adam and... I'm glad that instead of hate and animosity, we have a competition for the most cheese pizza eaten."</p><br><p>"Well, it's much better than having an enemy. We didn't know each other before the arena fight, so we were just fighters there, but..."</p><br><p>Adam raised his hand, pointing to the food and a tower of empty plates.</p><br><p>"Adam and Fromund sat at this table. Plain and simple."</p><br><p>Grinning, Fromund turned around, casting a glance over his shoulder at Adam.</p><br><p>"Indeed, plain and simple... Too bad it doesn't always work out that way in life."</p><br><br><p>Then, it was time to part ways.</p><br><p>Fromund, Elva, Liv, and Tilda with Arayna were the first to leave the medical department. After a few minutes, Adam, his family, and Osana headed for the exit.</p><br><p>'Hmmm... Where is Silvana?' Adam thought.</p><br><p>He looked around looking for his Operator.</p><br><br><p>Finding himself in front of a tall, heavy gate, something touched Adam's shoulder. He slowly turned around to see Silvana, an awkward smile on her face.</p><br><p>"Sorry, the park here turned out to be surprisingly beautiful and well-maintained. I only wanted to walk around for a few minutes, but... I timed it wrong."</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head. He didn't understand why Silvana gave him such an elaborate explanation, it was as if she was justifying herself to him for something.</p><br><p>"Well, it's good you're here. We were just leaving." Adam shrugged, not wanting to think about it too much.</p><br><p>Osana cast a glance at Silvana.</p><br><p>'How strange, her look has changed. Did my words make her think? Hmm, maybe that's a good thing. She's a smart girl, but... in some things, she actually acts silly.'</p><br><br><p>The gate closed as several black cars pulled up to the entrance. Osana and Silvana headed home, as did Adam and his family.</p><br><p>Before entering the car, Adam looked at Osana.</p><br><p>"No more dealing with nobles. The next time we meet it should be either in the Third Ring or in the Dead Lands."</p><br><p>"Hah, sure." Osana giggled, "I hope I don't have to save your ass this time."</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a satisfied smile and sat down in the front seat.</p><br><br><p>This evening was no different for them than any other.</p><br><p>The Rule of Power was complete, the fighters had successfully woken up and there was no trace of their wounds or mental fatigue.</p><br><p>But... an event of this magnitude always had consequences and they didn't necessarily involve each of the fighters.</p><br><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p><br><p>Several quiet, measured knocks sounded on the old wooden door, waiting for the owner of this quiet house on the edge of the Third Ring to come in.</p><br><p>It was late at night, but the light in the windows showed that the residents were not about to fall into slumber.</p><br><br><p>Light footsteps sounded from the other side as the door was opened by a girl of medium height, she was the eldest of the three sisters.</p><br><p>"Who's there? It's late, so hurry up and tell me what you need."</p><br><p>Then, Elva raised her head as her eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"I hope you're hungry young lady, just like your brother and two sisters, since this is a pizza delivery!"</p><br><p>Keeping a straight posture and one hand on his cane, Erik effortlessly held an entire tower of square cardboard boxes in one hand, inside each was an appetizing, hot pizza from the best place he could find.</p><br><p>Soon, Liv and Tilda appeared in the aisle, curious to know who came in so late and why Elva was suddenly silent.</p><br><p>"Mr. Erik!" Tilda exclaimed happily running up to him with a wide smile on her face.</p><br><p>She wanted to hug him, but... the tip of the cane jabbed into her chest stopped her.</p><br><p>"Young lady, don't be in a hurry. I'm afraid that any shaking will lead to disaster. If the balance is disturbed, we'll lose a lot of delicious pizza." Erik glanced up, pointing to the top of the tower.</p><br><br><p>Then, at the end of the aisle appeared Fromund, who unlike his sisters got a frown. He understood who Erik was, not knowing what a man of such status was doing here worried him.</p><br><p>"So... May I come in?" Erik asked politely.</p><br><p>"The longer I stand in the cold wind, the faster the pizza gets cold."</p><br><br><p>A calm voice came from outside, Fromund's blue eyes shining amidst the darkness.</p><br><p>"Come in, be our guest."</p><br><p>Erik smiled widely, taking a confident step forward, his long crimson like his hair coat, fluttering in the wind, swaying before Elva, Liv, and Tilda's multicolored eyes.</p><br><p>"Oh, I will do so with great pleasure. I'm certain the frown will soon fall from your face. I am a good guest, I assure you."</p>
