            <h4>Chapter 1454: Bitter Coffee (Part 2)</h4><br><br><p>Adam slowly climbed the stone staircase as he opened the large wooden door.
</p><br><p>He found himself not in a modern hotel lobby, but in a more antique version. The floor was covered with carpet, the walls were decorated with paintings and ornaments, and a middle-aged woman was waiting for him behind the desk, her age betrayed by her slight wrinkles and a few gray strands in her black hair.
</p><br><p>"Mr. Adam, we were surprised when we were informed that you had chosen our humble place to stay after your long absence. We are flattered," she bowed slightly.
</p><br><p>Adam looked around, gazing at the massive crystal chandelier hanging from the dome in the center.
</p><br><p>"Hah, modest place, you say? I’m sure even for the First Ring residents, the prices here are too high."
</p><br><p>In response, the woman smiled.
</p><br><p>"I hate to admit it, but it’s true. We focus not on the number of guests but on their quality, as well as their comfort and tranquility. I think in your situation, that’s exactly what you need, which is why you came here."
</p><br><p>Adam shrugged. "Yeah, that’s fair."
</p><br><p>"Moreover..." She narrowed her eyes, staring intently at Adam. "For a Phantom of your level, money has long ceased to matter, hasn’t it?"
</p><br><p>"Well, even if that’s the case, money is still an important thing for you, isn’t it?"
</p><br><p>She said nothing, but responded with a slight nod.
</p><br><p>"Alright, I’ll be blunt, I need a quiet room with a shower. When you spend several months in the monster lands, you forget how important hygiene is. I won’t hide it."
</p><br><p>"Sure, we have a suite available for you. However, something tells me that before that, you would like to do something else. Am I right?"
</p><br><p>Adam grinned as he leaned on the desk.
</p><br><p>"Hah, I may be strong, but your experience and intuition can only be gained over the years. Yeah, I want something. A cup of coffee, a good one."
</p><br><p>"Great, in that case, this way."
</p><br><p>The woman pointed ahead. In the distance, an archway led to another hall.
</p><br><p>"Many hotels have restaurants on the first floor, but we have a coffee shop. Sure, you can order a meal and dessert there, but our specialty is coffee."
</p><br><p>Adam grinned as he took the keys and turned toward the coffee shop.
</p><br><p>’Damn, they use cards everywhere, but they have regular keys?’ He thought, looking at the green trinket. ’Hah, this place is really trying to preserve its old-fashioned atmosphere. I wonder who owns this hotel?’
</p><br><p>There were many tables in the coffee shop, but only a few of them were occupied. As the woman had said, there were few guests at their hotel, but they all came here on purpose because they knew what they wanted.
</p><br><p>At a table in the distance sat a middle-aged man leisurely reading a book, while at another table in the corner was a woman slowly reading a document.
</p><br><p>Besides them, there was an old man behind the bar, who was obvious from his gray hair combed back and thick mustache. Still, for his age, he looked more than dignified. His shoulders were broad, his eyes burned with fire and wisdom, and his wrinkles only adorned his overall appearance.
</p><br><p>He slowly wiped a glass, seemingly unaware of the new guest, although he already knew that Adam had arrived.
</p><br><br><p>Adam sat down as the old man put the glass aside.
</p><br><p>"Good afternoon. I must say, it’s not often you see young people in this place." The old man’s warm voice made Adam smile.
</p><br><p>"Hah, if it weren’t for certain circumstances, I would have chosen a different place. No offense, but it feels like I came here thirty years earlier than I should have." Adam shrugged.
</p><br><p>The old man nodded understandingly.
</p><br><p>"I know, it’s hard to be the famous Phantom. Still, since you’re my guest, what can I do for you, Adam Vinter?"
</p><br><p>Adam wasn’t surprised that the old man knew his name; it showed that the old man in front of him wasn’t just a bartender, but was only trying to appear as one.
</p><br><p>"Coffee, black coffee, no sugar."
</p><br><p>The old man headed for the shelf where a pack of coffee was waiting for him. He had to go through all the steps from start to finish, from grinding to pressing, to create a small cup of coffee full of strong aroma and bitter taste.
</p><br><p>"How about dessert? Maybe cheesecake or a delicate éclair? I’m sure you’ll remember this taste for a long time."
</p><br><p>Adam wanted to refuse. Initially, he thought he would drink a cup of coffee and head to his suite to wash up and get ready before meeting Silvana.
</p><br><p>However, the old man’s offer was too tempting for Adam to refuse.
</p><br><p>"Sure, I hope this éclair is worth it."
</p><br><p>"Of course. I can give you my word that you won’t be disappointed. That is, if you like sweets, otherwise it would be unfair. Hahaha."
</p><br><p>A few minutes later, Adam had a cup of black coffee and a simple-looking éclair filled with delicate cream inside.
</p><br><p>This was not a fancy restaurant with exquisite presentation or some modern place where every dish had to look extravagant to attract attention. People came here for simplicity and quality, for pure taste.
</p><br><br><p>Adam took his first bite as a pleasant crunch sounded. The sweetness of the cream filled his mouth and made his eyes widen for a moment.
</p><br><p>In fact, there were no problems with the desserts at the Tarnished Lands. Misty was a true master at this, and she knew how to make coffee at a high level as well.
</p><br><br><br><p>Adam took a sip as he took a deep breath.
</p><br><p>’Damn, Misty knows what she’s doing, but she’s still far from this quality. It’s so delicious!’
</p><br><p>He wanted to eat the dessert in the next bite, but the atmosphere of this place did not allow him to rush. He did everything slowly, while the old man washed the coffee pot.
</p><br><p>"Maybe it’s none of my business, but today my curiosity is particularly high. May I ask what you are going to do next?" The old man asked.
</p><br><br><p>"Meet my Operator. Her name is Silvana."
</p><br><p>"Oh?" The old man raised an eyebrow. "Is she just your Operator, or something more?"
</p><br><p>Adam smiled, understanding what the old man was talking about.
</p><br><p>"She has a special place in my heart. If it weren’t for her, I wouldn’t be here now, and I wouldn’t be able to enjoy this coffee and dessert."
</p><br><br><p>"I see. That’s nice to hear. I hope your future will be just as bright."</p>
