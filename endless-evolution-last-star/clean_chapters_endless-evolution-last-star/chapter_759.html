            <br><p>Adam blinked a few times, the Evolution Tree's words slowly filling his mind with meaning. Adam didn't have the most ordinary relationship with his Evolution Tree, yet they were definitely not enemies, more like allies who argued quite often.</p><br><p>However, up until this point, the Evolution Tree had never directly said anything about Adam's power.</p><br><p>The reaction was immediate, a bright flame appeared in his eyes - the desire to fight was at an all-time high, but even more, he wanted to see if he became as strong as the Evolution Tree said he was.</p><br><p>"You say stop whining and just kill them? Hah, that's probably the best advice I've ever gotten!"</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam dashed forward, a fiery explosion forming at his spot the moment his silhouette appeared in front of one of the two maidens.</p><br><p>The Soaring Martyr didn't expect Adam to be so fast, she swung her arms to fly back, but he was too swift.</p><br><br><p>With one hand, Adam gripped her wrist tightly, feeling her cold stone skin that looked soft and tender but wasn't.</p><br><p>The Soaring Martyr jerked her left arm, causing the three crimson orbs to move. She was a dangerous creature at long range, but when the enemy got close enough, the situation was no longer in her favor.</p><br><p>The flaming needle was raised high, Adam was ready to attack, cut the Soaring Martyr in two, then deal with the second one, but something he already learned.</p><br><p>'It doesn't always work that way, but...' Adam internally muttered while his body shifted slightly to the side, 'Fighting against a Soaring Martyr, you definitely shouldn't rush. Any successful attack from their side is the equivalent of death.'</p><br><br><p>Three crimson orbs swept in front of Adam, one in front of his eyes rippling the tips of his hair, the second in front of his chest destroying the end of his collar and the third a few centimeters from his knees.</p><br><p>The Soaring Martyr gasped, not believing that none of her attacks struck Adam, the speed and power were enough, he was just ready for it.</p><br><p>Then, Adam glanced up at the Soaring Martyr, even though the maiden was hovering above the ground, she was still slightly lower than Adam, allowing him to look down at her.</p><br><p>His gaze hastily filled with arrogance, at that very moment, Adam felt that the Evolution Tree wasn't trying to cheer him up or motivate him - it was much simpler than that.</p><br><p>"You're right... If that's all a Dark Mid Yellow monster can do... then I don't even realize how strong I am right now."</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam jerked his head back before bringing his forehead down on the Soaring Martyr's with all his might.</p><br><p>Their heads crashed in with a thud, bone, and flesh colliding with material that resembled stone more than maiden skin.</p><br><p>Adam didn't just do it because he thought it was effective, he wanted to test himself for strength.</p><br><p>In a case like this, it wasn't the one who attacked or was attacked who lost the most, but the one whose defense was worse.</p><br><p>The one whose forehead would crack would prematurely take the loser's place.</p><br><br><p>With a loud crunch, the Soaring Martyr's skin crumpled while deep furrows ran along the edges of the hollow, revealing pink flesh.</p><br><p>Drops of blood rushed out, falling onto Adam's face, his forehead intact without even a scratch.</p><br><p>Normally, after a successful attack, Adam would have continued the onslaught, wanting to take advantage of the momentum to quickly overwhelm the enemy.</p><br><p>But... now he was doing nothing. Adam stared wide-eyed at the unusual pink drops of blood flying past him.</p><br><p>A clash of foreheads - his little test showed how things really were.</p><br><p>Auras were a good way to determine an enemy's strength, but not perfect. Like an eternity ago, there was only one way to know who was stronger for sure - to fight in readiness for either victory or defeat.</p><br><p>"I see... The Two Walls... You are not the challenges that open access to power, you are my power, isn't that right?"</p><br><p>The second delay that Adam allowed himself was a lifeline for the Soaring Martyr. She flew aside a few meters, groaning in pain and humiliation.</p><br><br><p>With an irritated shout, the Soaring Martyr pointed two hands forward, causing the three crimson orbs to accelerate to the limit and dash at Adam.</p><br><br><p>Adam took a step back, dodging two of the orbs, but the third one moved slightly behind him, specifically to catch him as he changed position.</p><br><p>Seeing the orb fly towards his head, Silvana's eyes went wide, believing that Adam hadn't expected a delayed attack:</p><br><p>'Adam! To the right!'</p><br><br><p>With a quiet voice, barely above a whisper, Adam pointed his left hand to his side, clutching the crimson orb tightly.</p><br><br><p>A torrent of wind rushed over Adam due to the orb's abrupt stop, the round object continued to spin rapidly for a while, the hard surface ripping the skin of his palm apart, leaving dozens of tiny cuts and rips.</p><br><p>But... the momentum quickly lost its power from inertia, the crimson orb halted, Adam's fingers gripping it tightly like an ordinary ball rather than the lethal weapon of a dangerous monster that was far higher in level than he was.</p><br><br><p>Streams of blood dripped from the gaps, dark red drops one after another as they clashed with the cold surface.</p><br><p>The slight heat from the numerous wounds radiated from Adam's palm, but it was more pleasant than annoying.</p><br><p>Returning his hand to his own, Adam's eyes fell on the crimson orb, examining the unusual weapon closely.</p><br><p>"It was painful, but... it didn't even hurt my flesh. Was it worth the delay and caution?"</p><br><p>Adam remembered the Soaring Martyr's first attack.</p><br><p>"Seems like the worst thing that could happen to me then was a smashed forehead, that thing wasn't strong enough to blow my head off, not anymore."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The crimson orb shuddered vigorously, the Soaring Martyr tried to retrieve her weapon, yet there was no way the orb would leave Adam's grasp.</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam turned towards the maiden, for a short clash the position of the forces changed drastically - the strong one realized that he was the powerful one and the weak one met the cruel reality.</p><br><p>"Hey, I honestly caught it, so it's mine now."</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam clutched the orb tighter until his fist clenched completely, shattering the round object into rubble.</p><br><p>The Soaring Martyr gasped. It was unknown how long ago the Soaring Martyr had last fought against the Phantoms, but she couldn't believe what was happening.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, three crimson orbs headed towards Adam from behind, after a brief look the second maiden decided to join the battle. She waited for the right moment to attack, but their opponent was much stronger than they expected.</p><br><p>With a slight smile, Adam stepped forward, transforming into a shadow and leaving only a flaming burst behind him.</p><br><p>In a few deadly leaps, Adam found himself facing the second a Soaring Martyr, this time he had no plans to experiment.</p><br><p>He learned everything he needed to know.</p><br><br><p>A long needle engulfed in flames effortlessly entered the Soaring Martyr's belly, piercing her body through.</p><br><p>The sharp tip covered in pink blood showed on the other side, glistening in white lights from the bloody circle.</p><br><br><p>The Soaring Martyr gritted her teeth and grabbed Adam's needle, trying to pull the blade out of her body. She didn't bother using her orbs, as it was obvious now that they would just tear the skin on Adam's back, but wouldn't do any serious damage to him.</p><br><p>The flames burned the Soaring Martyr's white skin, quickly changing its color to black like burnt stones.</p><br><p>Realizing the gravity of the situation, the Soaring Martyr lunged forward, blood from her forehead dripping down her pale face, soaking her black blindfold.</p><br><p>However, she wasn't fast enough to save her sister.</p><br><br><p>Adam abruptly pulled out the needle and jumped high up, simultaneously raising one leg embraced by the cruel red flames.</p><br><p>"Right, I'm so strong now, not only because of my powers but also you Lone Blaze... I never thought I'd have fire abilities, albeit temporary..."</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam's foot became a shadow, collapsing directly onto the Soaring Martyr. The flame pillar rose high up, blasting the Soaring Martyr's head in a fiery glow.</p><br><p>Scraps of stone skin flew off to the sides, but the pink flesh wasn't as tough.</p><br><p>Adam simply returned to his stance, watching as the Soaring Martyr's legs shook slightly.</p><br><br><p>With a thud, the decapitated body collapsed to the ground, energy trying to repair the wounds, but if it wasn't a Regenerative Monster, it couldn't live without its head.</p><br><p>Adam turned around meeting the gaze of the remaining Soaring Martyr, her body actively trembling with fear.</p><br><p>She wanted to save her sister, but there was nothing she could do, she just didn't have time.</p><br><br><p>With a serene gaze, Adam appeared in front of her, smoothly plunging the needle straight into her head from below, passing through her throat and brain, the red flames burning everything from the inside out.</p><br><p>"Alright, they're done, but that's just the beginning of the problems, isn't it?"</p><br><p>His voice was calm, still anxiety was building inside him.</p><br><p>Twitch. Twitch. Twitch.</p><br><p>The massive crystal in the center shook actively, while a creaking sound came from the two flesh clots hanging from the ceiling.</p><br><p>The ritual was on the verge of breaking, the blood circle sensed it, so it was ready to use the last line of defense against the unstoppable Phantom.</p>
