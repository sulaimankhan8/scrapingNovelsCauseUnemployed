            <br><p>Adam's tips of black hair fluttered, an excited smile was on his face and a bright fire burned in his eyes.</p><br><p>He hadn't realized it before, but having a doctor like Dahla being a K2-Phantom meant that he was limited by nothing but his own will.</p><br><p>'Hah, against Damien things were a little different. He's a real monster, Tron is much weaker, though... in front of both of them I'm a weakling.' Adam said to himself, clenching his folded fists tighter.</p><br><p>He kept his hands over his head, about to bring his fists down on Tron like hammers.</p><br><p>'Back then, I was just learning my new abilities, the Evolution Tree was slowly telling me about them, but now, I know what I'm capable of.' Adam's mind filled with confidence as the muscles in his arms tensed.</p><br><p>Tron watched his actions carefully. He watched Adam fight against Damien, so he knew of all of Adam's abilities.</p><br><p>His amethyst eyes observed Adam's hands intently, the air around them trembling.</p><br><p>'I see, just like last time, the purple energy streams signifying gravity only appear for a moment, then into action goes the effect.' Tron nodded before reaching his hand forward.</p><br><p>He did not use his blade, his weapon remained in his right hand, the glass tip pointed towards the ground.</p><br><p>Adam's facial expression changed slightly.</p><br><p>'Hm? Is he planning to block my attack with one hand? Fine, that'll help me figure out if I'm right or wrong.'</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam brought his fist down directly on Tron.</p><br><p>Tron's pupils narrowed as the energy traveled quickly down his arm. He didn't use the ability that caused the explosion but simply applied the Energy Control.</p><br><p>Unlike Adam, who was still learning how to use Energy Control even at K2-Level mastery, Tron had mastered the Energy Control in excellence, as much as it was possible for a K3-Phantom.</p><br><br><p>Adam's fists came down on Tron's exposed palm, channeling all of his power into a single point.</p><br><p>When Adam fought Damien, with a similar attack but with one hand, Adam was able to destroy Damien's rod that was made of Dark Yellow Threat monster.</p><br><p>Thus, he was confident in the power of his attack completely.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The training hall trembled, the walls shaking vigorously like a strong earthquake. Silvana and Riska, who were watching the fight from afar, clutched their chairs tightly to keep from falling. Dahla shrugged nonchalantly, it was easy for her to keep her balance from such a slight shake.</p><br><p>Tron frowned slightly as the amber resin beneath his feet cracked, covering it with thin white webs.</p><br><p>The recoil traveled through his entire body in an active shudder, wanting to break him with its sheer weight, but... it was only a matter of seconds before it all disappeared.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam's eyes went wide, his fists were in Tron's palm, but there was no more power in his hands, the momentum had already passed.</p><br><p>Tron slowly looked down at the cracks in the amber resin. They were already tending to disappear, quickly growing overgrown under Tron's gaze.</p><br><br><p>Adam's hands went limp as they fell, hanging at his belt, slowly swaying from side to side.</p><br><p>"Only one attack, isn't it?" Tron asked as he looked at his left hand.</p><br><p>His fingertips were trembling and his entire hand felt numb. Tron had to put effort into clenching his hand.</p><br><p>It was only a temporary effect after he blocked Adam's attack, but it still impressed him since with his attack, Adam disabled Tron's left hand for a few seconds.</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a bitter smile on his face.</p><br><p>Tron's left arm went numb, but Adam couldn't even lift his arms, he couldn't feel them, only a faint warmth emitted, traveling through his body.</p><br><p>"Well... technically I can use my Elemental Root for two attacks, but since I used two hands at once in this strike, I need a break..." Adam shrugged, his hands twitching like toy hands.</p><br><p>"I see..." Tron said calmly.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, the broad glass blade plunged into Adam's stomach, cutting through flesh and skin without resistance to emerge on the other side.</p><br><p>Droplets of thick blood fell from the sharp tip, shattering against the sturdy amber.</p><br><br><p>Streams of blood gushed from Adam's mouth, his face contorted in pain and his eyes filled with incomprehension.</p><br><p>"Adam, I've told you many times. We will fight until you are near death."</p><br><br><p>With those words, Tron turned the blade slightly, bringing a new wave of pain to Adam.</p><br><p>"Or... In the Dead Lands, in front of the Plague Reaper, would you have started small talk in the middle of battle too?"</p><br><br><p>Tron raised his blade upward slightly, slicing through Adam's flesh from the inside out. Massive clots of blood fell to the ground, Adam's teeth were clenched tightly in an attempt to endure the hellish pain.</p><br><p>He could feel the sharp blade cutting into his flesh, but there was nothing he could do about it. Sure, he faced more serious wounds, but not in such a calm environment.</p><br><p>"Adam, you must forget that this is training. You have to think of it as a mortal combat against a stronger opponent. Otherwise... you won't be able to progress fast enough and break the First Wall before the wedding begins." Tron said seriously, not intending to back down from his plan.</p><br><br><p>Adam took a deep breath, bringing himself to his senses.</p><br><p>Then, he threw his head back and smiled contentedly, making Tron feel strange.</p><br><p>"A stronger opponent you say? Hah, aren't we on the same level right now?"</p><br><p>Tron's pupils narrowed. He didn't expect that in just a few attacks, Adam would be able to realize that there was a deception about K3-Level. Tron lowered his strength to the limit of the K2-Level.</p><br><br><p>Before Tron could say anything, Adam stepped forward, despite the broad blade embedded in his body.</p><br><p>With each step, the sharp edges reminded him of himself with vivid pain, but Adam paid it no mind.</p><br><p>"Dahla may be a harmful woman, but she sure knows her business, so... I don't have to worry about my safety fighting against you, do I?" Adam smirked as electric shocks went through his entire body.</p><br><p>A bright gleam passed across his eyes, followed by the appearance of ten rings on his fingers from which emanated half a hundred silver threads.</p><br><br><p>Adam's fingertips twitched slightly, it was the most he was capable of in his current state. His hands still needed time to recover.</p><br><br><p>A shudder went through all the threads as they rained down on Tron like hail, wanting to cut his flesh into shreds.</p><br><p>Each thread was saturated with electricity, gaining speed and power that was normally unavailable.</p><br><p>Tron's eyes went wide, then he chuckled slyly, and his eyes shone brightly filling with energy.</p><br><p>"Still eager to fight no matter what, right? Well, in that case, I'll show you that this was just the beginning!"</p><br><br><p>Purple energy rushed from Tron's hands, reflecting in Adam's blue eyes filled with the desire for battle.</p><br><p>Then, came Adam's first defeat, so fast that he barely had time to realize it.</p><br><p>It was a new power he had never faced before in their confrontation. It made him want to see something like this again.</p>
