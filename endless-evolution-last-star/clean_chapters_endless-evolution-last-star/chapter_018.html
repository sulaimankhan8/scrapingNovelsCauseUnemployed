            <h4>Chapter 18: Dark World</h4><br><p>"Did you get anything worthwhile?" Silvana asked, looking at Adam's glowing eyes. </p><br><p>"Yeah, it looks like it. I want to try this as soon as possible! Let's go to the virtual zone!" Adam exclaimed excitedly, ready to rush into battle right now. </p><br><p>New abilities were always something exciting, encouraging further action. It seemed that Adam could no longer be stopped. </p><br><p>"Excluded." Silvana said sternly. </p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam tilted his head. </p><br><p>Silvana didn't answer anything, she just showed him a tablet with a picture of him, or rather a 3D model of him. It showed all the injuries he'd received, many he hadn't even realized he had. </p><br><p>"During the Resonance, you didn't pay attention to this, but in those few minutes, you seriously scarred your body. You may not listen to me, but I strongly suggest you rest for a week. The whole time you'll only be working out and eating well. Moreover, you could use some rest after what you've been through." </p><br><p>The Phantoms were just as human as the others, not on the outside, but on the inside. They were just as happy, sad, and most importantly afraid. </p><br><p>If it wasn't for the stress experienced by Adam after Morton Observatory, he could have easily panicked. Most of the rookie Phantoms would have just ingloriously died four days ago. </p><br><p>"I see... I didn't realize it was this bad, since I feel fine." Adam muttered, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. </p><br><p>"Also, you need to tighten up your knowledge. You've only recently become a Phantom, so you'd do well to learn more about monsters, how to get stronger, and think about choosing your Nexus." </p><br><p>"Nexus...? What is that? Some kind of condition again?" Adam was puzzled. </p><br><p>Silvana shook her head, then she clicked something on her tablet, and dozens of photos of various equipment appeared in front of Adam, be it a huge sword, a crossbow, combat gloves, or jewelry. All of them looked special somehow as if they were custom-made. </p><br><p>"Surely you must have wondered by now why Phantom weapons can damage monsters, but grenades or high-volume explosive rounds can't." Silvana pronounced. </p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, for even though it was obvious, he hadn't given it much thought. </p><br><p>"Yeah... sure..." Adam muttered, scratching the back of his head. </p><br><p>Silvana narrowed her eyes. </p><br><p>"Anyway. Nexus is a special piece of equipment that only Phantoms can get because your Initial Gene will be the main component of your future Nexus. Usually, Phantoms make their Nexus into some sort of weapon, but I think in your case it doesn't make sense." </p><br><p>"Because I have a needle, right?" Adam sighed. </p><br><br><p>"In theory, you could build your Nexus as soon as you got your license, but it's best to do it after the first few missions. Given the challenges you've faced before, you should already have an idea of what you need for future battles." </p><br><p>Adam lay back on the bed, putting his hands behind his head. </p><br><p>"When do I have to make a decision? </p><br><p>"I recommend you do it in these three days. One day to prepare and another three days to build the Nexus. It will be exactly one week, and you can rush into battle." </p><br><p>"I see... I want to ask one more thing. I don't have any restrictions on the Nexus, do I? I mean, I can choose to wear a turret shield and a long cloak and knee-high boots, right?" </p><br><p>Silvana smiled slightly, "Sure, but it has to be something necessary. Creating another Nexus is possible, but adjusting will be problematic, so most Phantoms take this choice very seriously, after all, it's likely your first Nexus will be your last." </p><br><p>"By the way..." Silvana muttered with a serious face. </p><br><br><p>"Are sure you don't want that nurse? A night with her would help you recover faster." Silvana raised a finger as if saying something instructive. </p><br><p>Adam's eye began to twitch, he couldn't believe what he was hearing, but all he could do was accept it. </p><br><p>After all, it was he who had chosen Silvana as his Operator. </p><br><br><p>By evening, Adam had left the hospital, he could have stayed here for a while if he wanted to, but he wanted to get home as soon as possible. </p><br><p>Silvana tried several times to get him a car, but Adam refused because he wished to walk along the Third Ring. He had wanted to get here for a long time, he had a home here now, but he hadn't been anywhere else. </p><br><p>"Well, well, you're awake now. Amazing, especially after what happened to you." </p><br><p>A calm voice sounded, from a man standing at the corner of the alley. It seemed like he was here for a reason, waiting for someone. </p><br><p>"Hmm? Are you addressing me?" Adam pointed to himself, puzzled. </p><br><p>The man blew out a puff of smoke, clasping a nearly smoked cigarette between his fingers, and turned to Adam. His silhouette was hidden not only by the night darkness but also by his long coat with high collar and bowler hat, only his green eyes, like emeralds, were visible. </p><br><p>"Yeah, Adam Vinter, to see you. You know, the video of your fight against Prime Stone Goliath has become popular in tight circles. Military, Operators, Harvesters, employees of various departments, and even the Phantoms appreciated the young talent who suddenly appeared a few days ago." The man muttered in a deep voice. </p><br><p>Adam frowned, he felt a strange tension. </p><br><p>"However..." The man looked at the cigarette before tossing it aside and saying, "I was impressed by something else. The way you survived after what happened at Morton Observatory." </p><br><p>"Who are you?" Adam asked coldly, clenching his fists tightly. </p><br><p>The man pulled a card out of his inside pocket with the image of a black swan on it. </p><br><p>"Here. Comes. Say you're from Wilfred, and you'll be escorted where you need to go. Perhaps we can help you with Aiden Henk. I know you don't fight humans, but some of us are more like monsters than humans." </p><br><p>With those words, the man vanished without a trace, seeming to dissolve into the darkness, leaving a card in Adam's hands with only two words written on it - 'Lower Ring'.</p>
