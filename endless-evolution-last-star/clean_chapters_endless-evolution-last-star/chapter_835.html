            <br><p>This time, no one was waiting for them at the entrance. The platform reached the end, becoming part of the surface in one of the many buildings filling Heaven Island.</p><br><p>The building was of white stone, unusual for the Citadel, and it was empty inside, seeming to serve only as a curtain for the platform.</p><br><p>Douglas waved his hand, stepping off the platform first.</p><br><p>"Come on, follow me. I realize you have many questions, and your curiosity will never be satiated, but we came here to solve a problem."</p><br><p>Silvana glanced at Seyrina, she winked, beckoning Silvana over to her.</p><br><p>Adam remained alone on the platform, in no hurry to go outside.</p><br><p>Realizing this, Douglas stopped, he turned, glancing at Adam over his shoulder.</p><br><p>"Is something wrong?"</p><br><p>"The Heaven Island..." Adam muttered, "Can I get stronger here and make it to K3?"</p><br><p>Without delay, Douglas nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"No doubts about that. You'll have to try, but I'm sure you'll create the Second Key quickly and save Silvana the risk of being burned by her energy."</p><br><p>Silvana flinched, the Heaven Island made her forget that she was a ticking bomb.</p><br><br><p>Then, Adam stepped out of the building for the first time, getting a view of Heaven Island.</p><br><p>His eyes went wide, watching the unusual scene.</p><br><p>Like the rest of the Citadel, there were many buildings. However, they were not skyscrapers of steel and glass, the buildings were quite low, there was simply no need for skyscrapers.</p><br><p>The bright light from the sun spread along the barrier, turning into a white glow in the distance as if the boundaries of this world.</p><br><p>There were practically no streets, only roads made for the need of vehicles, while the paths lined with stones were much more numerous, ready to take the traveler to any point of Heaven Island.</p><br><p>Heaven Island was not as big as Adam imagined it to be from below, his perception was strongly influenced by the angle.</p><br><p>The Heaven Island was half the size of the First Ring. However, it was still large enough for hundreds of buildings or thousands of people, though it was never that crowded.</p><br><p>The next thing that caught Adam's attention was the cyan crystals arranged all over Heaven Island in a chaotic pattern, indicating that they grew here naturally.</p><br><p>'How unusual...' Adam thought, looking at one of the nearest crystals, 'There is such a dense and powerful energy in them that I feel drawn to them I'm like some monster. I wonder what is causing them to grow?'</p><br><p>Adam was confused. He thought that energy crystals only appeared at the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>For crystals to grow, a powerful, constant source of energy was needed to fill even the air. The same was true of all objects with energy in the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>Douglas and Seyrina were silent.</p><br><p>They gave Adam and Silvana time to enjoy the view, for it was only at the very end that they noticed the main structure.</p><br><p>"Agh...? What's in there?"</p><br><p>Adam pointed to a majestic gray tower with an open top. The tower was located in the very center of Heaven Island, like its core.</p><br><p>A pale blue glow emanated from the top, hiding behind a featureless cover.</p><br><p>"You'll find out soon enough." Douglas stepped forward, "For we're heading straight there. There, Adam, you will have the opportunity to become a K3-Phantom and learn one of the Citadel's major secrets."</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana exchanged glances. They had no choice but to find out what Douglas was talking about.</p><br><br><p>After only fifteen minutes, they approached the tower, facing great, white stairs with dozens of steps, like the path to the throne, for until they got higher they couldn't see what was beyond.</p><br><p>During this time they saw only a few people in the distance, some were from Gamma Division, and a few were K3 or K4 Phantoms. If they were on the Heaven Islands, they had a reason to be there.</p><br><br><p>Step by step, they gradually ascended, stopping before the sight of a path, white stones leading to a massive gray gate, part of a tower.</p><br><p>Without a moment's hesitation, Douglas stepped forward, intending to approach the gate and open it, Seyrina was with him.</p><br><p>Looking around, Adam and Silvana followed the path, with each step feeling a strange pressure affecting not their bodies but their energy.</p><br><br><p>As soon as Douglas and Seyrina were close enough, the gate opened with a loud rumble, allowing four silhouettes to pass through.</p><br><p>Douglas waved his hand, heading forward in a confident stride.</p><br><p>"Do not delay. This is important."</p><br><p>Not one to argue, Adam sped off, Silvana following behind them. Soon they were over the border, the gates immediately closed, expelling powerful torrents of wind.</p><br><p>Pale blue light fell on their faces, causing them to freeze in place as if they were all petrified.</p><br><p>A gigantic tree seemingly capable of reaching to the heavens with its branches was hidden behind the dense tower walls.</p><br><p>However, the tree was long dead, dry, without a single leaf or sapling falling nearby, but something was wrong.</p><br><p>The bark glistened in the light, having a strange metallic covering as if trying to show that this tree was not born from a sprout but from energy and genes.</p><br><p>But... where was the blue glow coming from?</p><br><p>Adam's pupils twitched, his mind filled with disbelief, chaos from every possible thought raging.</p><br><p>A massive crystal from the roots to almost reaching the upper branches sat in the center of the tree. In streams constantly came out powerful, pure energy ready to outshine even the midnight crystal.</p><br><p>Besides the energy, Adam sensed something else, an unfamiliar aura - an ancient one. The aura was neither hostile nor friendly, but it showed its greatness, received by right.</p><br><p>In the crystal was locked a girl, her skin as pale and delicate as jade, her blonde hair flowing in heavenly waves down her back and shoulders to her waist.</p><br><p>Her arms were spread apart, and her legs were pressed together, her knees slightly bent, the flesh on her legs partially joined, it was impossible to separate them anymore.</p><br><p>The girl's eyes were tightly closed, it was unknown if they would ever open again.</p><br><p>After a few minutes of silence, Douglas's voice rang out:</p><br><p>"Adam... Remember this moment, because now you are looking at one of the major secrets of the Citadel."</p><br><p>Douglas put his palm to his chest before uttering:</p><br><p>"This is Queen Elisa."</p>
