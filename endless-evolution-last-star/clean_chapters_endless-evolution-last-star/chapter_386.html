            <br><p>The silver spoon dipped into the small cup, reaching the bottom. With a slight movement of the hand, the spoon began to swirl, mixing the coffee with a lot of sugar, way too much.</p><br><p>'Hmm... What was that all about?' Osana muttered looking through the sturdy glass at Adam, who was floating in the blue liquid inside the healing pod.</p><br><p>A few hours ago, Katrin was in the pod next to Adam, but her injuries weren't as serious as Adam's, so she had been released a little earlier.</p><br><p>Sure, she still had to heal her arm and for that, she would need to go to Miracle Observatory if she didn't want to waste much time. That posed some danger, but it was unlikely that Katrin wouldn't be able to handle some regenerative monster.</p><br><p>Osana underwent a quick treatment. Her artifact was able to bring her back from the world of the dead, but she still had serious, though non-lethal wounds. However, considering the condition of the others, her situation was favorable.</p><br><p>They were originally supposed to go to Fort Norton or rather the medical department next to it, but... they ended up at the Iron Observatory.</p><br><p>Refesa dealt with technology and weapons, but she had some unusual healing pods with her solution. Moreover, she had Magnus helping her, since Nessa was part of the healing process.</p><br><p>Considering who was in charge of their treatment, there wouldn't be a trace of their wounds very soon.</p><br><p>But, Osana wasn't thinking about Refesa, Magnus, or the fight against Plague Reaper, her thoughts were on Adam, specifically the moment he stepped out of the fighter.</p><br><p>Osana had excellent intuition, perhaps that was why she was still alive, so she sensed that Adam had somehow changed in the short time they were flying in XH-01.</p><br><p>'He only took a few steps and collapsed from exhaustion. Nothing is surprising about that, but that woman was terrified, though neither Katrin nor Adam was obviously trying to scare her.' Osana bit her lip, pondering.</p><br><p>Now, she wanted to see what Adam would do when he finally woke up, moreover... He still had to grant her three wishes, like her own personal genie.</p><br><p>Discover exclusive tales on empire</p><br><p>"Hey, I wouldn't frown so much if I were you, or you'll get more wrinkles than you think." Refesa said, sitting in the center of the room in front of a wide panel.</p><br><p>Osana cast a glance at her.</p><br><p>"Wrinkles? You're considerably older than me, but you look like a little girl, as a doll... You surely know how to deal with that, don't you?"</p><br><p>Refesa's corners of her mouth went up.</p><br><p>"Yes, you're right. Come to me whenever you want to get younger, though... for now, there's no need for you to do so."</p><br><p>Osana smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"If I get into missions like this a few more times, I won't even make it to 30. I don't know how Adam survives each time, but if it weren't for my artifact and cold calculation, my body would still be there."</p><br><p>Refesa looked at Adam, she narrowed her eyes and shifted her gaze to Osana with a slight nod.</p><br><p>"You're lucky they pulled it off in the end. That Plague Reaper was stronger than most documented Plague Reapers. You can be proud of yourself."</p><br><p>Osana didn't answer anything, she only took a sip of coffee sweet as syrup.</p><br><p>'Proud of yourself, right...? What am I fucking proud of? Selling my mates, letting them die because I didn't think they could win even with my enhancement?'</p><br><p>Then, Osana frowned heavily, clutching her cup tightly, the handle cracking.</p><br><p>'The Mission Department has already labeled this mission as extremely successful, all just because we killed Plague Reaper. But... out of my squad, only one Phantom came home... How can that be a success!?'</p><br><p>Refesa watched as Osana's gaze gradually grew darker and her grimace harder.</p><br><p>'Well, well, even if she's smart, cunning, and cold-blooded it doesn't mean she's ready for all the blows that life can throw at us. It takes a life experience filled with pain or else...'</p><br><p>Refesa shifted her gaze to Adam, floating serenely in the pod while his wounds were rapidly recovering.</p><br><p>'Gotta be a monster...? I'm sure his mind isn't occupied right now with regrets for the fallen Phantoms.'</p><br><br><p>Thanks to Refesa's help, by afternoon, Osana, Katrin, and Adam had already left Iron Observatory.</p><br><p>They departed at different times without crossing paths. Each of them had their tasks for the day, as did Adam who, a few minutes later, ended up in front of the metal door of a simple apartment in a high-rise building.</p><br><br><p>The door opened, revealing Silvana.</p><br><p>She was in a strict formal suit as always, greeting her Phantom and only partner with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>Her green eyes were full of desire to continue their journey together, while her black hair rippled slightly. Unlike her costume, her hair was loose rather than strict.</p><br><p>"Hey, it's been a while, hasn't it?" Silvana said with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>"Yeah... It's only been one day, but... it feels like it's been much longer. I wouldn't say an eternity, but long enough for me to start missing the Citadel, home, and you." Adam smiled weakly before stepping forward.</p><br><p>The door shut, Silvana wanted to say something but didn't have time, Adam stepped close to her, leaning down to her bare neck.</p><br><p>"Agh... What a nice aroma, calm and peaceful..."</p><br><p>Adam whispered softly, with his eyes closed.</p><br><p>Silvana said nothing, she only gulped, not understanding how she was supposed to react. Adam had caught her off guard with his strange actions.</p><br><p>"You know how good it is to smell something other than the scent of blood, flesh, and dust covering the Dead Lands wherever you go. It's... refreshing..." Adam said in a prolonged voice before heading forward towards the kitchen.</p><br><p>"Let's get something to eat, Dead Lands has some serious problems with that too."</p><br><p>Silvana nodded silently, staring at his back.</p><br><p>What was Silvana thinking then?</p><br><p>Well, there was an answer and a pretty accurate one at that.</p><br><p>'I need to remember which perfume I used today... I need to pick it out more often, much more often...'</p><br><br><p>Silvana noticed that Adam was not behaving as usual. His state was sublime as if he was very exhausted or someone who had rested too much.</p><br><p>But, as soon as he tasted Silvana's food prepared especially for him, Adam returned to normal.</p><br><p>"Damn! I finally feel alive! Fuck! This is so good!" Adam exclaimed like a child with a wide smile on his face.</p><br><p>He kept eating faster and faster, as if if he didn't hurry up the food would disappear.</p><br><p>Silvana only smiled, his appetite was the highest praise for her culinary skills.</p><br><p>"So...? You're finally ready, aren't you?" Silvana asked, taking a cup of coffee in her hands.</p><br><br><p>"Yes. I have everything I need to create the First Key, I'm ready to do it right now! Only, I need to get the artifacts."</p><br><p>Silvana sighed contentedly.</p><br><p>"Good. Let's go to the storage room, your new trophy isn't there yet, but everything will be in place soon. Then, we'll head to Fort Norton."</p><br><p>"Hmm? Why?" Adam tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><br><p>"Hahaha, you weren't thinking of creating the Key here or somewhere in the city, were you? Not that it's impossible, but it's better to do that sort of thing in special places."</p><br><br><br><p>The massive gate opened, letting Adam inside, into a spacious room with nothing but massive slabs of stone reinforcing the walls.</p><br><p>Silvana watched him from the side.</p><br><p>"Well... Let's get started." Adam muttered glancing at the artifacts that were already here and closing his eyes immersing himself in the inner space.</p><br><p>Now he had everything, the genes, the artifacts, and the midnight crystal.</p><br><p>All that remained was to create the Key.</p>
