            <br><p>The External Artifacts could have minds, abilities, and desired forms, both physical and energy. One could start a conversation with the External Artifact, discuss a plan, or even conclude a pact, like Adam and Lone Blaze did.</p><br><p>However, the External Artifacts were neither monsters nor Phantoms. To call them a third, new entity would be misleading, for in one way or another they were very dense energy, built up over years or born from a powerful anomaly.</p><br><p>Often they resided in the Strongholds and could gradually form a field of the irregular energy around them with the desired effect. Lone Blaze did something like this with their Stronghold, before Adam came there and the Crimson Monarch's temple deep underground appeared.</p><br><p>For the External Artifacts, it opened up a lot of possibilities and was a great advantage that they had a mind of their own rather than being a mere cluster of energy.</p><br><p>But... Sometimes, it could lead to something devastating.</p><br><p>Neither Phantoms nor monsters could harm the energy, but killing or absorbing the External Artifact was more than possible.</p><br><p>That was why Radiant Mirage was now in a difficult situation. He couldn't run away, the External Artifacts were devoid of mobility. He didn't have his warriors like Lone Blaze, for he preferred to hide and further store energy to evolve.</p><br><p>Adam leaned in, their foreheads almost bumping into each other.</p><br><p>Neither the fragments sharp as blades nor the mysterious mirrors hovering around them frightened him. He knew that against K3-Phantom and the External Artifact, Radiant Mirage didn't stand a chance.</p><br><p>"Hurry up. I don't have much time," his cold voice rang out.</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage gulped.</p><br><p>"Wait! Stop pressuring me! I don't mind making a deal, but... What happens after this is over?"</p><br><p>For advice, Adam turned to Lone Blaze, her stern gaze not allowing Radiant Mirage to relax for a second.</p><br><p>"He's afraid that after the final battle against Arnoth and Kreyna, he'll be next."</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage's eyes went wide. "Yes! Until you showed up, I kept the serpents in fear! They knew not to go against me! But... now they'll definitely want to devour me after defeating me! I don't need that!"</p><br><p>Oddly enough, his words were reasonable. It made Adam think for a moment.</p><br><p>"I see. But, it was bound to happen sooner or later. As you can see, Lone Blaze became my ally."</p><br><p>"Tsk, you don't understand," Radiant Mirage waved his hand irritably. "It's one thing to make the pact and continue to evolve with Phantom, but it's quite another to become a monster's breakfast!"</p><br><p>Adam wanted to say something, he had an idea of how things could be done right, but Radiant Mirage beat him to it.</p><br><p>"SHIT! I was just a little short of getting to the next stage... A few more months and everything would be fine..." Radiant Mirage gritted his teeth in deep resentment.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Adam's hand fell on his shoulder, kindly as if reassuring his younger brother.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Radiant Mirage flinched, stumped.</p><br><p>"Look, you're right that your situation is worse now, but I have one option for you. You'll be in as good hands as Lone Blaze."</p><br><br><p>"Are you ready to hear my offer?"</p><br><br><p>The bright light in Adam's eyes faded as he returned to the real world.</p><br><p>Heret, Grita, and Torz looked at each other, puzzled. Risha gasped in disbelief.</p><br><p>It had been a long conversation for Adam, Lone Blaze, and Radiant Mirage. Considering this was Radiant Mirage's space, they had plenty of time. But, for the others, it happened in a matter of seconds.</p><br><p>The mirror knight shattered into shards, and the dead end turned into a shivering layer of glass like the surface of a lake.</p><br><p>"Alright, the way is clear. I've arranged everything," Adam smiled, stepping forward.</p><br><p>The others watched wide-eyed as Adam disappeared behind an invisible wall.</p><br><p>Torz gulped. "What the hell...? We come begging that fucking External Artifact to help us, but... he just came and made a deal?"</p><br><p>The three serpents, the three monsters, were puzzled, but deep inside, they were glad. This was good news. They needed good news.</p><br><p>Anything that could help them become stronger was crucial.</p><br><p>In the end, only one Risha remained in front of the passageway.</p><br><p>She like the others could walk through the mirage, but her dark gaze showed that she was immersed in thought.</p><br><br><p>Adam came out of the wall, looking at her with a raised eyebrow.</p><br><p>"Hey, let's go. You have no idea what's on the other side! That's awesome!"</p><br><p>Risha slowly turned to him. "So... Did you take that External Artifact for yourself?"</p><br><p>That was not the question Adam was expecting.</p><br><p>"Hmm? What are you talking about?"</p><br><p>She frowned heavily.</p><br><p>"You made the pact with this External Artifact?! Answer me!"</p><br><p>Adam didn't know what the matter was, but he could see from Risha's expression that it was important to her.</p><br><p>"No," he coldly replied. "Even if I wanted to, it's impossible."</p><br><p>She gave him a questioning expression.</p><br><br><p>"I already have a pact with one External Artifact. It is located right in my Initial Gene. I don't know if it's possible to make a replacement, but I have no reason or desire to do so."</p><br><p>With his speech, he wanted to end the conversation. After all, Risha was a K3-Phantom just like him. As of late, they were at the same stage with three open gates.</p><br><p>Well, Adam forgot that everyone had different paths.</p><br><p>Risha's knees collapsed to the ground, her lips trembling in horror.</p><br><p>"What...?" she wheezed. "You made a pact with the External Artifact while at K2-Level? But... How did the artifact agree to such a thing? It's worse than death to them! I... I absorbed the External Artifact to get the Artifact Star to open the Star Seal...''</p><br><p>'Wow... So I could just absorb Lone Blaze?'</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head awkwardly.</p><br><p>'Right, the Evolution Tree mentioned something about that, though I'd be unlikely to do it. Wait... So Risha doesn't have the External Artifact?'</p><br><p>A sly grin covered Adam's face.</p><br><p>'Oh, looks like we're going to have to renegotiate our deal at a rapid pace.'</p>
