            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1334: Lightning Clouds</strong></p><br><p>“Hey… He actually did it, right?” Norax smirked as Adam temporarily disappeared from their view.</p><br><p>Misty’s bats, two of them, immediately headed upward, but it took them some time to reach the clouds towering above the ground. Adam was only able to get there so quickly because of Karso’s alternating blasts and flames, which were actually an additional challenge for him.</p><br><p>“Sir, isn’t that too dangerous?” Narica asked. “Considering that Karso recently killed one of the wyverns, the monsters soaring above the clouds might be angry with him.”</p><br><p>Norax shook his head. “Nah, they would never go against Karso, they understand what would happen in that case. However, you are right that even ordinary eagles can pose a threat to Adam.</p><br><p>“Are we going to do something?” Misty asked, waiting for an answer. She was ready to accept any.</p><br><br><p>“We’ll keep watching, that’s it.”</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Adam turned around as his blue eyes reflected several black talons, long and curved like those of a great eagle ready to seize its prey.</p><br><p>‘What? There are flying monsters here?’ Adam exclaimed internally before swinging his sword.</p><br><p>The electric blade caused the eagle to flap its wings and fly to the side to dodge the attack, but another bird was already behind him.</p><br><br><p>Something sharp dug into Adam’s back, causing him to cry out in pain. A massive beak like a spear pierced his back as the eagle’s eyes flashed, eager to tear Adam apart.</p><br><p>“Adam! You need to get out of here, right now!” Silvana exclaimed, seeing what Adam couldn’t see because of the blinding pain.</p><br><p>Despite the frightening torn clouds covering the Forgotten Mills, it, like virtually any area above cloud level, was not off-limits to flying monsters.</p><br><p>They could arrive here from different parts of the world, crossing hundreds of kilometers in hours or even minutes if they had the necessary abilities.</p><br><p>Fortunately for Adam, he had an easy way to stop all this.</p><br><br><p>He swung his sword, summoning several electric blades to drive away two eagles and three dark birds whose bodies were covered not with feathers but with scales like lizards, and only their broad wings were covered in black feathers.</p><br><p>Now, he had to create a platform of energy above himself and jump off it to return to the fight against Karso, who was patiently waiting for him below.</p><br><p>However, Adam was in no hurry to do so. Instead, he used his energy to hover amid the fierce winds. Sure, he was gradually descending, but he had significantly slowed his fall.</p><br><p>“No. Karso didn’t throw me here for no reason. He may not seem as calculating as Misty or Narica, but this man knows exactly what he needs to do to become stronger. I do not doubt that.”</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip. She could feel the powerful auras of the birds, and what’s more, about a dozen more were heading in from all sides.</p><br><p>As long as Adam was above the clouds, it was their territory, they knew it, and they weren’t going to miss this opportunity. Especially now that Adam had a huge amount of energy, which was a valuable source of power for any monster.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, for Adam, this was also an opportunity to become stronger, which was why Karso had thrown him here and had not tried to bring him back to earth.</p><br><p>“I’ll make it simple…”</p><br><p>Adam raised his sword above his head as all five birds attacked him at once. He had a few seconds to prepare his attack—that was enough.</p><br><p>He wasn’t going to do anything complicated, as his tactics were straightforward.</p><br><p>“Only 10% left, which means I still can’t use all my energy… Well, I’ll just take what I can get.”</p><br><p>At the same moment, all the power in Adam’s body flowed into his sword as his eyes glowed brightly with a heavenly blue light.</p><br><p>Silvana’s energy flowed into the Dual Demon Sword as well, turning into electrical discharges that soon echoed across the sky like thunder, attracting attention.</p><br><p>Norax looked up as a smirk appeared on his face.</p><br><p>“Oh, he decided to go all in? Not bad. It might work.” He glanced to the side for a moment. “Misty, be ready to save Adam if anything happens. I believe in this little bastard, but Karso really put him in a difficult situation.”</p><br><p>Misty nodded calmly.</p><br><p>“Got it. I’ll do whatever it takes if I see that he’s in mortal danger.”</p><br><p>Gradually, Adam gathered enough energy as he took a deep breath, unafraid of the multitude of claws that surrounded him and would tear him to pieces in a second.</p><br><p>The veins in his arms bulged and his muscles trembled, but without fear in his eyes, he swung his sword, making the single most powerful cut he was capable of with this weapon.</p><br><p>At the same moment, several electric rings spread from him, running through the clouds like natural cataclysms, tearing them apart.</p><br><p>The eagles and flying monsters tried to resist, wanting to get to Adam, but soon the electric discharges simply shattered their claws into pieces and ran through their bodies, which were not prepared for this force.</p><br><br><p>In a panic, the distant flying monsters flew as far away as possible, trying to escape the violent lightning, but for those closest to him, it was all over.</p><br><p>The electric discharges put too much strain on their bodies, tearing them apart.</p><br><p>Everything darkened before Adam’s eyes as he breathed slowly, not yet fully realizing what he had just done. The last thing he saw before plunging into darkness was a few bloody feathers flying past him as a sign of his victory.</p><br><p>“Shit… I used too much power…” Adam muttered as the platform beneath his feet shattered. He didn’t even have enough energy for that.</p><br><p>He fell through the clear sky, for his strike had thrown the clouds hundreds of meters to the side, and only after some time would they return to their usual appearance.</p><br><p>Karso, who was standing on the same peak, looked up with a broad smile on his face.</p><br><p>“Well, well, his aura is like a bright flame.”</p><br><p>As he spoke, Adam flew past him, falling straight into the crimson mist.</p><br><p>Karso’s expression froze as his eyes widened.</p><br><p>“Shit! Gotta save him!”</p>
