            <br><p>Like the Phantoms, the monsters were capable of working as a team and cooperating to achieve a common goal.</p><br><p>That rarely happened among the different subspecies, but monsters preferred not to fight when their common enemies, the Phantoms, were on the battlefield.</p><br><p>However, monsters were not machines or soulless mechanisms, they were creatures of flesh and blood, for the most part. The most important thing was that monsters, even the weakest ones, had intelligence, and the stronger the monster was, the higher the intelligence was.</p><br><p>Sure, intelligence had many purposes, but one of the most important was to have a mind and, as a result - a personality. Thus just like among the Phantoms, among the monsters could appear those whose character, whose actions were illogical, selfish, and destructive.</p><br><p>Obviously, Thunder Demon was one such monster. However, the reason for his behavior was quite simple - he was stronger than the others.</p><br><p>Damien, or even Adam during Eclipse, had the same joyful smirk on their faces while their attacks killed monsters one after another.</p><br><p>This rare feeling - the pleasure of battle, which was deadly for everyone, could become so at any moment, because of an accidental mistake, it could only feel the strong ones.</p><br><p>If the one was weak, then instead of delight, he would feel only fear and awe in front of those who can achieve this state.</p><br><br><p>Thunder Demon's eyes flashed as his teeth shone brightly, and a dense energy emerged from his throat, quickly forming into a laser.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the laser traveled through the centipede's body, cutting it into several pieces.</p><br><p>Every time the laser touched the ground or the centipede's hard protective plates, there was a lightning blast causing a blue flame.</p><br><p>Given the speed of the laser and how fast Thunder Demon was moving his head, it wasn't long before everything was engulfed in a fiery inferno of explosions.</p><br><p>In an instant, the laser headed towards Adam and Tirana, not that they were Thunder Demon's target, just that Thunder Demon was attacking everyone and everything in sight. This monster had no preference, at least not yet.</p><br><p>Adam and Tirana fell to the ground simultaneously, the laser passing right over them, causing explosions a few meters behind them.</p><br><p>Adam gulped. He realized that even with Elemental Root, that laser would just cut him in two, nothing would help him against such pure destructive power.</p><br><br><p>One of the explosions, the closest one, sent a powerful shockwave that threw the wounded Ester and Romeo aside.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils narrowed as he quickly rushed forward, caught them, and ran towards the ruins.</p><br><p>No matter who his opponent was, first he had to protect those who came to his aid. One squad had already died, and there was nothing Adam could do about it, but now he had the power to change their fate!</p><br><p>Tirana took a step forward, about to chase after Adam, but she soon stopped, clenching her teeth tightly with her fists.</p><br><p>"Shit, how unfortunate is this!" Tirana growled in fury, realizing that she would most likely not be able to complete her mission unless something unexpected happened.</p><br><p>'Furthermore, where is Olax?! He always disappears when I need him!' Tirana inwardly exclaimed as her gaze naturally traveled towards the ruins, she felt that Olax could be in the same place where Fred was.</p><br><p>However, instead of Olax, Tirana only saw particles of dark smoke that slowly rose up, only to dissipate and disappear forever.</p><br><p>Tirana's gaze deepened, and her eyes filled with sadness.</p><br><p>"Oh... I see..." Tirana muttered, realizing that she would never see Olax again.</p><br><p>Tirana nodded slightly. Now, she had one more reason to take revenge on Adam and his friends. Perhaps... her revenge stood much higher than the mission.</p><br><br><p>Adam climbed the ruins, carrying Romeo and Ester to safety. The first thing he saw was the already dead Olax, his eyes were closed, and there was a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Hey, what's up?" Fred waved his hand with a tired expression on his face.</p><br><p>"Things are pretty bad, aren't they?" Adam frowned, watching Thunder Demon tearing apart centipedes and other anomalous monsters.</p><br><p>For him, it was a feast, bloody and boundless, for no anomalous monster could defend its anomaly from this nightmare.</p><br><p>Fred nodded as his gaze grew serious. He already knew that Ester and Romeo had lost, since he had been watching everything from afar.</p><br><p>"We need to wait for K3-Phantom or perhaps someone stronger to arrive here. Dealing with Thunder Demon in our position is almost impossible." Fred said seriously, he realized that the best thing they could do was to hide and wait.</p><br><p>Adam looked around, at the anomalies that were spreading farther and farther away and the three main ones growing denser and more powerful. Then, his gaze went to the Thunder Demon, who was using his energy as if his reserves were endless.</p><br><p>"Hey, soon his energy has to run out, right? Even if he's an Essence Type, the way he uses his energy is too wasteful. For other monsters, a laser alone would be equal to several full energy reserves." Adam asked, staring intently at Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>Fred shook his head as he sighed heavily, letting Adam realize how naive his assumption was.</p><br><p>"Well... With Essence Type, things aren't simple at all. Especially if the Essence Type in the Anomalies Cluster with the right element. Just watch what this walking madness can do..." Fred muttered, watching Thunder Demon with a detached voice.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Fate seemed to have heard from the conversation and provided the opportunity to see things at their most vivid. However, the real reason was that the anomalies felt threatened by Thunder Demon and summoned a monster strong enough to defend itself.</p><br><p>A huge shadow comparable in size to a five-story building emerged from the ground. The creature had broad shoulders, a massive torso, and long arms and legs.</p><br><p>If this monster were smaller it might have been a Crown Type, but there was one more thing that distinguished it from anthropomorphic creatures - two huge heads.</p><br><p>Without waiting for Adam's question, Silvana quickly said:</p><br><p>'This is the Prime Two-Headed Dark Tyrant. Normally, this monster is rated as Top-10 among Purple Threat Level, but considering that it's an anomalous version, I think it's around Top-9 or even Top-8, a lot depends on the situation, pure strength is quite difficult to determine accurately.' Silvana explained.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah... I can feel how powerful his aura is, but... Thunder Demon is much higher in the rankings, isn't it?" Adam gulped, realizing that Dark Tyrant could do nothing against Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon was several times smaller than Dark Tyrant, but he wasn't afraid of the giant monster in front of him. Anyway, their strength was at a completely different level.</p><br><p>Sure, if Dark Tyrant was a Top-8, considering the help from anomalies, then the difference between them was only 6 positions, not much, right?</p><br><p>Well, Top-5 monsters were significantly stronger than Top-10 ones, and those in the Top-3 were simply invincible creatures to Top-10 ones.</p><br><p>That was why, instead of fear or at least seriousness, Thunder Demon only licked his teeth, with a predatory smirk on his face.</p>
