            <br><p>For a long moment, Silvana stared at Adam with only the occasional blink. His words replayed in her head over and over again.</p><br><p>She realized that Adam was right, he was completely sincere.</p><br><p>Before, Silvana could only help him, she had no way to influence the outcome of the battle directly, since she was miles away, safe in her room.</p><br><p>However, this night was different. Silvana saved Adam, for if he didn't have a working left arm, he would surely lose.</p><br><br><p>Silvana shook her head.</p><br><p>"You shouldn't say that... I was just doing my job. I didn't do anything special."</p><br><p>Suddenly, a short, joy-filled laugh was heard from outside:</p><br><p>"Hahaha. Hey, there's no need to be so modest. I'm an idiot, I shouldn't have used the artifact twice. That was stupid."</p><br><p>Silvana looked away, shyly facing him with a glare.</p><br><p>"Anyway, you were doing a good thing... You were trying to save the Phantoms. I'm sure if you didn't sacrifice your arm, there would be even more casualties."</p><br><p>She like the others saw the Crimson Monarch's attack, through Adam's sight. The laser was of intimidating power, if she had been at the fortress she wouldn't even be able to escape, remaining in place with trembling legs.</p><br><p>"You had to do it... I just finally managed to be useful to you."</p><br><br><p>Adam touched her chin, forcibly making her stare at him.</p><br><p>Silvana gasped, she didn't know what to expect next but didn't dare resist.</p><br><p>"I saved my Phantom fool. Say it."</p><br><br><p>Before she could say anything, Adam stopped, his finger halting in front of her lips.</p><br><p>"Hush, that's not what I'm asking you to do. Just repeat after me - I saved my Phantom fool."</p><br><p>Despite Adam's insistence, Silvana was still hesitant. It was all so strange, and childish, but she knew Adam well, so she understood that he wouldn't back down.</p><br><p>Clearing her throat, Silvana's lips parted, their eyes locked.</p><br><p>"I saved my Phantom fool..."</p><br><p>Her voice shook, and her heart began to beat faster. She couldn't believe she was saying that.</p><br><br><p>"I saved my Phantom Fool."</p><br><br><p>Silvana clenched her fists tightly to exclaim one last time.</p><br><p>"I saved my Phantom Fool!"</p><br><p>At the same moment, Silvana felt someone's arms embrace her tightly, not hesitating to press her close.</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, cautiously opening her eyes. Instead of Adam, all she saw was his shoulder, while his hands roamed down her back.</p><br><p>"For this, your Phantom fool is grateful to you. I can only win my toughest fight thanks to you, only because you took my pain upon yourself."</p><br><p>In silence, Silvana snuggled into his shoulder, only her eyes remaining visible.</p><br><p>"You really are a fool... I didn't mean to do that, it's just... it was my opportunity to help you..."</p><br><p>Adam smiled, pulling her tighter against him.</p><br><p>"I know, that's why I'm grateful. I'm sure you did something out of the ordinary since neither I nor you have heard of such abilities..."</p><br><br><p>Silvana raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><br><p>"I also wanted to see the confused expression on your face, you look so funny at times like this."</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, with her face red with embarrassment Silvana sunk her teeth into Adam's shoulder - her revenge for another embarrassment.</p><br><p>"Ouch! Hey, just a little more, and you would eat me. Although..."</p><br><p>Adam smiled weakly, feeling how good he felt, the peace and quiet.</p><br><br><br><p>Silence fell for a while. Silvana's heart imperceptibly began to beat much faster. She could hide her emotions from Adam, but not from herself.</p><br><p>Soon, Adam slowly opened his eyes.</p><br><br><p>His pupils dilated in disbelief, his blue eyes reflected red flecks of flame, quite real.</p><br><p>Before Adam could realize anything, a scalding heat was in his chest. The first thing he thought of was the sun seal, but he quickly realized that the sun seal was long gone, because his pact with Lone Blaze was over.</p><br><p>After a second, Adam realized that the heat was coming from Silvana, though she didn't notice it at all as she continued to enjoy the moment.</p><br><p>Adam was baffled, he didn't know what was going on, and should he have disturbed Silvana?</p><br><p>Soon, he got the answer to his question.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a powerful stream of fire rushed from Silvana, raging in all directions. It was not something Adam could ignore, for the flames quickly spread, moving to the bed, the nightstand, and even Silvana's clothes that couldn't resist the fire.</p><br><p>"Silvana! You must see this!" Adam exclaimed, tugging at her shoulders, and pulling her out of the sweet embrace.</p><br><br><p>As if dreaming, Silvana looked around. She couldn't realize that the fire in front of her was real, but watching her sleeve burn quickly brought her back to her senses.</p><br><p>Her eyes went wide as she moved away from Adam, afraid of burning him.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the room was lit up by a red light, the alarm rising through the hospital, signaling a fire.</p><br><p>"Adam..." Silvana muttered, fear filling her eyes, "I don't know what's going on... I didn't want any of this!"</p><br><p>Adam's gaze quickly darted to the side. Flames were running in active streams down the walls, reaching everything they could. Most of the bed was already on fire, and the nightstand was quickly, burning ready to turn to ash in just a minute.</p><br><p>However, Adam remained calm. He quickly realized that the power of this fire was no different than a normal one. It could burn a forest, but not a dry log in the Dead Lands, and the same was true for Adam. Long gone were the days when such flames could leave even the lightest of burns on him.</p><br><p>Silvana's teeth clattered, her heart beating faster and faster as if ready to explode, her clothes quickly burning to shreds. Panic was consuming her, she realized this was all happening because of her, and she didn't know how to control it.</p><br><p>'Well, this is bad...'</p>
