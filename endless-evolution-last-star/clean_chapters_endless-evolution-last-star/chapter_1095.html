            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1095: Core Nexus</strong></p><br><br><p>Three figures led by Wilfred emerged from the cave onto an icy expanse. All around them, lakes of blue frosty liquid extended for hundreds of meters, dotted with ice crystals and numerous monsters running around.</p><br><p>Somewhere in the distance, the outlines of great structures could be seen, where truly powerful monsters dwelled, but Adam, Silvana, and Wilfred did not need to disturb them.</p><br><p>They needed to go back, which meant their path lay toward the nearest tunnel.</p><br><p>The only thing they had to decide was how they would get there.</p><br><p>Fast or slow? With a fight or without?</p><br><p>“What do you say?” Wilfred turned to Adam as he nodded toward one of the monsters. “Want to test your strength? But, be warned. I’m not going to save you if you can’t handle some weakling.”</p><br><p>They both knew that Adam wouldn’t need Wilfred’s help. Maybe if they were attacked by someone very strong, then yes, but not against this monster.</p><br><p>“Hah! You could have asked!” Adam stepped forward, but he stopped abruptly. “But what about its power? What level is this big guy at?”</p><br><p>Adam’s first opponent after his evolution, or rather his warm-up, was going to be a large frosty beast with dense white fur, two long horns, and blue eyes as sharp as blades.</p><br><p>Wilfred’s eyes turned to the beast, causing the monster to flinch, but the beast didn’t retreat.</p><br><p>“This one? This is the Frozen Krugo. Well, I just found that out.”</p><br><p>Apparently, Wilfred’s Operator had informed him of this.</p><br><p>“This is the First Black Threat Level. Moreover, like most monsters here, this one is a Dormant Phase Monster, so you have nothing to worry about.” Wilfred waved his hand.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana exchanged confused glances.</p><br><p>“First Black Threat Level…? Well, I can almost understand that.” Adam scratched the back of his head, confused. “But what does the Dormant Phase mean?”</p><br><p>Wilfred shook off the ashes with an indifferent look. “You’ll find out when you defeat it. Although, to some extent, it won’t be anything new to you.”</p><br><p>It was hardly an answer to Adam’s questions, but it was all he could get at the moment.</p><br><p>“Alright, in any case, it’s time to fight!” Adam clenched his fists tightly as he stepped forward.</p><br><p>The excitement was evident in his eyes as energy gathered around his hand.</p><br><p>This time, he didn’t call on his needles or use energy from the Global Gene. There was only one thing he wanted to try.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Space distorted as his Nexus, the Epos of Exhausted Descent, covered his right arm.</p><br><p>The first and smallest ring was on his wrist, and the last, fifth ring stopped just before his shoulder. Because it was not a heavy gauntlet but five rings connected by chains, nothing hindered Adam’s elbow.</p><br><p>Wilfred raised an eyebrow, and even his eyes showed curiosity.</p><br><p>“I don’t know exactly what’s supposed to happen, but the description of this thing was scary,” Adam mused, looking at his Nexus. “I don’t think it would be a good idea to try to use all five at once. I think it’s better to start with one, right?”</p><br><p>The description of his new weapon was more than vague, but one thing Adam understood was that he would have to expend a lot of energy to activate a large number of rings.</p><br><p>He didn’t want to be exhausted right after his evolution. Moreover, if Wilfred chose the Frozen Krugo for him, he wouldn’t need all his strength to deal with this monster.</p><br><p>The Frozen Krugo understood Adam’s intentions and accepted the challenge. Unlike the man on the sidelines, Adam’s aura did not seem so intimidating.</p><br><p>“Rgh!” the Frozen Krugo roared, charging forward.</p><br><p>The thin layer of snow covering the icy ground trembled with each step the monster took, as its aura began to press down on Adam with all its might.</p><br><p>But, even though Adam had just evolved, his aura in a calm state was enough to block all of the monster’s attempts.</p><br><p>All of Adam’s attention was focused on his first ring, which trembled slightly at the first energy surge.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The first ring shook as ancient runes flashed on its edges, illuminating Adam’s face. A crimson layer of energy covered his hands like a calm stream, drawing its power directly from the first ring.</p><br><p>Silvana’s lips curved upward. She was glad that Adam succeeded, but her smile quickly faded from her face.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s gaze became exhausted. She noticed it easily and judging by Wilfred’s groan, he did too.</p><br><p>“Tsk. Dangerous weapon,” Wilfred uttered. “He used all of one part, but the recoil has already come. Well, I hope the result will be worth it.”</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Frozen Krugo, who was no longer willing to wait, lunged forward.</p><br><br><p>Adam raised his head, meeting the gaze of the roaring monster.</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam stepped forward as his frame shook. With a crimson burst, he appeared above the Frozen Krugo, his fist raised back for a strike.</p><br><p>A moment ago, the monster was ready to attack, but now it jerked its entire body to dodge Adam’s strike.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s fist slammed into the ground, as crimson burst like an explosion rushed forward, but it was not flame. From the point of impact, several thin, thread-like blades extended, some touching the Frozen Krugo, who seemed to be already out of range.</p><br><p>Blood spurted from the monster’s chest, flooding the ice in front of Adam as he slowly rose.</p><br><p>“I see…” Adam clenched his fist tightly, shifting his gaze to the Frozen Krugo.</p><br><p>Three thin but fairly deep cuts covered the monster’s chest. It wasn’t a fatal wound, but it wasn’t the full force of Adam’s strike either. The Frozen Krugo dodged, only the crimson blades reaching him.</p><br><p>“Destructive power and cuts. Moreover, I definitely became physically stronger after activating the ring. Not bad, I’d like to use the second one, but…”</p><br><br><p>A trickle of blood flowed from the corner of Adam’s mouth.</p><br><p>“I don’t think that would be a good idea.”</p>
