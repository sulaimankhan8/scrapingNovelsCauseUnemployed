            <h4>Chapter 1453: Bitter Coffee (Part 1)</h4><br><p>Teleports were one of the fastest and most high-tech ways for the Citadel to move around. No fighter jet, even the fastest one, could match a teleport in terms of efficiency.
</p><br><p>Sure, teleports had several drawbacks, especially if a Phantom was going through teleportation for the first time and wasn’t prepared for the side effects.
</p><br><p>When Adam used the teleport for the first time, he felt dizzy and nauseous, but now he felt almost nothing.
</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped off the platform as several people in white military uniforms greeted him.
</p><br><p>"Welcome to the Citadel, Adam Vinter!" they exclaimed as Adam nodded deeply.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, I’m finally home. I hope none of you have any questions for me. Because I can’t waste any more time."
</p><br><p>The man with the short beard shook his head.
</p><br><p>"Of course not. We know what battles you’ve been through at the Tarnished Lands, and that two young Phantoms detained you at the spire. We’ll be happy to know when you decide to return to the Dead Lands for your next mission, but for now, we hope you get some proper rest."
</p><br><p>Adam smiled as he stepped forward.
</p><br><br><p>He wasn’t a big fan of military discipline, so he was pleased with this response. However, the Gamma Division had much more authority than ordinary military personnel. After all, it was largely up to them how quickly the Citadel could return to its former state after the upcoming World Wipe.
</p><br><p>It seemed that a few months were not enough to wean him off civilization, but when Adam saw the black car waiting for him, he was surprised.
</p><br><p>"Hah, in the Tarnished Lands, the best you can hope for is a carriage, right?" Adam grinned before opening the door.
</p><br><p>The driver nodded as her voice rang out:
</p><br><p>"Where would you like to go?"
</p><br><p>"Well... I’d like to meet up with my family or Operator." Adam smiled and leaned toward his armpit as he frowned at the pungent smell. "I think the nearest hotel would be a good place to start."
</p><br><p>Before starting to drive, the driver had one more question:
</p><br><p>"I understand that, given the situation, I should choose a deserted place, right?"
</p><br><p>"Oh, it seems that besides those two, someone else knows about my increased popularity?" Adam smiled bitterly.
</p><br><br><p>"It was inevitable. Many K3-Phantoms are much more popular than you. The only thing that saved you before was how fast you progressed. Even with your battles, it takes time for popularity to build up."
</p><br><p>"Agh, damn, that doesn’t sound like good news at all. Alright, let’s go. I can’t show up like this in front of Silvana."
</p><br><br><br><p>The black car started moving, leaving the military facility and heading towards the private sector of the First Ring.
</p><br><p>Along the way, they drove through the busy streets of the city, while thousands of people hurried about their business. Now, it was only morning, but even in the sunlight, the skyscrapers looked majestic, showing the economic power of the First Ring over all others.
</p><br><p>Many youths stood in groups and looked at something on their phones. Perhaps some of them were watching one of Adam’s battles right now.
</p><br><p>If it were a famous Phantom, then his edited fight against a dangerous monster could easily get more views than a movie or TV series with a million-dollar budget and famous actors.
</p><br><p>This was not surprising, as only powerful Phantoms such as Adam and others could provide such a view.
</p><br><p>Moreover, people like Damien and Frida were too powerful and important. It had been many years since they last fought anyone, at least in a battle that was publicly accessible.
</p><br><p>Adam smiled faintly as he looked at the people. One man’s eyes shone brightly with joy. Something good had happened to him.
</p><br><p>Another girl was frowning as she returned from school, while many people moved in streams, each lost in their own thoughts.
</p><br><p>No matter how many battles Adam would go through and how strong he would become in the future, he couldn’t deny that there was beauty in such a casual life.
</p><br><br><p>Adam’s gaze grew darker.
</p><br><p>’If nothing is done, in just seven years, it will all turn to nothing. No, even sooner. None of the ordinary people will survive the World Wipe, even with the help of the queen’s barrier. Agh... and that includes my family as well.’
</p><br><p>He understood that by thinking about this, he was only creating problems for himself. Right now, he had no way of influencing the World Wipe.
</p><br><p>However, he had to strive for it if he wanted to change anything.
</p><br><p>’I have the First Grand Star and Second Grand Star. How many more stars do I need to create my Constellation? Will that be enough to reach the Second Rank, or will I only approach the limits of my evolution?’
</p><br><p>Adam knew that the Path Construct was the main obstacle on the way to the Second Rank, but not the last one.
</p><br><p>Many K4-Phantoms had already fulfilled all the conditions for decades, passing every trial that the Path Construct had set before them, but they still could not reach the next stage.
</p><br><p>Even for monsters, whose evolution was much easier, moving from the High Elder to the Lord Stage was a great achievement. For the Phantoms, everything was much more difficult.
</p><br><p>’Well, I used to be a simple man, but now I am a K4-Phantom. There were many points along my path where I could have died, where the next trial could have been too dangerous, but I made it through, just like all the other K4-Phantoms...’
</p><br><p>Adam was lost in thought, saying nothing during the trip.
</p><br><p>A little over an hour later, their car stopped in front of a simple-looking building with a cozy brick facade. This building was very different from the glass skyscrapers and reinforced concrete structures in the very center of the First Ring.
</p><br><p>"We’re here. I’ve already informed the manager of your arrival. I think everything should be ready."
</p><br><p>Adam nodded as he was about to get out when the woman asked him:
</p><br><p>"Before you leave, what will you do first?"
</p><br><p>"Hah..." Adam lowered his gaze. "I think I need a cup of strong coffee."</p>
