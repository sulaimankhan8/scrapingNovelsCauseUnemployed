            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1151: Path Construct (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>At each stage of evolution, new obstacles appeared before the Phantom. The Phantoms were not unique in this; monsters also had to pass through many barriers to reach their true power, but the Phantom way was always much more difficult because the conditions were specific, and they could not simply absorb a lot of energy and begin evolution through force.</p><br><p>This becomes especially evident when the Phantom reaches the K2 Level and is faced with the task of destroying the Two Walls, then at the K3 Level, the Crystal Gates appear. Sure, the K0 and K1 Levels also had their challenges, but with each level, they became more difficult and longer.</p><br><p>No one was surprised by this; every Phantom was ready for new, more difficult trials to climb higher on the evolutionary ladder.</p><br><p>But… the K4 Level was different from all the previous ones.</p><br><p>If the Second Rank Phantoms and Lords did not exist, this would have been the peak of evolution, and to some extent, that was exactly the case.</p><br><p>The difference between the K4-Level and all the others was obvious—there were no longer any Keys that needed to be created to open the Lock.</p><br><p>The Keys had an important task—to unlock the previously limited potential of the Phantom. However, there were no longer any Keys, no Lock, and no chains that prevented the Phantom from gaining its full power.</p><br><p>Once a Phantom reached the K4 Level, it became the strongest among the weakest or the weakest among the strongest. The position changed greatly depending on the goals of the K4 Phantom.</p><br><p>Sure, all of them, like Adam, wanted to reach the Second Circle and become a Second Rank Phantom, but many gave up on this idea after decades of failure.</p><br><p>Well, many of the K4-Phantoms lived for several hundred years and saw several World Wipes. At the same time, they had long since lost hope that they would ever be able to reach the next level.</p><br><p>One of the reasons why this was so difficult was that now the Phantom had to create a new power instead of gradually unlocking the potential of himself and his Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>Very soon, Adam would realize how difficult his first step on this path would be.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The black orb was actively shaking, as was the Evolution Tree. Soon, Lone Blaze noticed the changes in the inner space, but before she could warn Adam, his instincts told him that something was wrong.</p><br><p>He turned around as his eyes widened.</p><br><p>The darkness that emerged from Lyrod’s body turned into a sharp dagger that stared at him like a snake.</p><br><br><br><p>The dagger pierced Adam’s head, filling his body with the ancient energy of the First Star. Silvana felt it as well as his Operator, but a major part went to Adam.</p><br><p>If he hadn’t absorbed the Twilight Crystal earlier, such an energy strike could have been fatal to him, as it was no different from Lyrod piercing his head with his energy.</p><br><p>However… considering all the circumstances, the dark dagger posed no threat to Adam. On the contrary, it was the key he needed to begin his journey as a K4-Phantom.</p><br><p>The other K4-Phantoms did not need to worry about this, as the First Star energy would simply not be interested in them, since they did not have a part of it.</p><br><p>All this happened only because Adam found himself at the Dark Shore and absorbed the Twilight Crystal, where the First Star had led him. This was due to Adam’s past battles. Only a few Phantoms managed to defeat the Hollow Wave monsters before reaching the K4-Level.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With the space trembling, Adam’s eyes turned completely black, both his pupils and the whites of his eyes, as darkness engulfed him, unwilling to leave even a speck of light from his hated enemy.</p><br><p>Ironically, in this world, it was the bearer of light who tried to destroy all life time and time again. The Last Star was the cause of everything.</p><br><p>Silvana tried to reach Adam’s mind with her cries, but he heard nothing, immersed in such pleasant silence.</p><br><p>Then, he opened his eyes, blue again.</p><br><br><p>Adam looked around, but saw no toxic lakes, destroyed squares, or towers. He was in inner space, but there was no Evolution Tree or Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>Even Silvana’s energy seemed to have disappeared.</p><br><p>This was further proof that the two of them had not yet reached the heights of the Second Rank Phantoms. Adam and Silvana were not capable of what Gladius or Damien could do.</p><br><p>But that power remained for the future. He would have to think about that only when he reached the Second Rank; now he had another task before him.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The black orb hovered before him, trembling from time to time. It was much larger than it had been before the Evolution Tree, the size of a hill.</p><br><p>“What should I do?” Adam stumbled in his attempts to understand what the First Star wanted from him.</p><br><p>Adam was not stupid; he understood that all this was happening because Lyrod had awakened from the dark dream and had the energy of the First Star within him. That was the catalyst, the beginning of everything.</p><br><p>In response to his question, a white key appeared in the darkness, more like a dagger, with a rough handle and a sharp serrated blade.</p><br><p>Even the First Star could not ignore its connection with the Last Star. The energy of the two stars permeated the world; it depended on both of them.</p><br><p>“So, another key?” Adam smiled. “Although… This will probably be the last one, right?”</p><br><p>With a bitter smile, Adam stepped forward and, without hesitation, plunged the key directly into the black orb.</p><br><p>He didn’t know what would happen next, whether he would destroy or open the black orb, but Adam knew one thing—he had to act.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>Cracks ran across the black orb as a bright light fell on Adam, forcing him to close his eyes.</p><br><p>The next thing he saw was a multitude of lines and bright dots resembling constellations. They all formed a difficult, winding path leading high up with the brightest star at the beginning.</p><br><p>Then, a mechanical voice unlike that of the Evolution Tree rang out.</p><br><p>[The Path Construct has been opened. It is time to choose the first star on the path.]</p>
