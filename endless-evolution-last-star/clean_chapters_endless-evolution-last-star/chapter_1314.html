            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1314: Spatula and Line (Part 2)</strong></p><br><br><p>Wanting to rectify the situation immediately, Adam headed to the Evolution Tree, his footsteps echoing with tremors through the endless darkness in which both he and all parts of his power hovered.</p><br><p>Without hesitation, he placed his palm on the bark, interrupting the golden beam that wanted to escape.</p><br><p>Adam’s plan was simple—to touch the energy of the Connected Heart and somehow subdue it. He didn’t know exactly how to do it, but he was sure he could control the energy that was already practically his.</p><br><p>However, as soon as he made contact, something unexpected happened.</p><br><p>His eyes shone brightly like two ghostly lanterns, and his consciousness drifted away somewhere far away, away from the Evolution Tree and the Path Construct.</p><br><p>In the darkness, Adam saw only one thing—a bright, straight line consisting of a myriad of white threads, among which were several golden ones that had not belonged to him until recently.</p><br><p>However, that line was only straight at its base; the edges were torn and distorted, and the threads went in all directions, turning what was presumably a sturdy frame into an incomprehensible, chaotic mess.</p><br><br><p>Adam received no answer. Instead, a bright flash blinded him, throwing him out, not only from this place but also from the Evolution Tree as well.</p><br><p>“Adam!” Silvana jumped to the side, catching him in midair.</p><br><p>Gradually coming to his senses, Adam looked at the Evolution Tree as the golden rays showed no sign of diminishing in intensity, instead seeking to elevate it even further to reveal the mysterious line even more clearly.</p><br><p>“Shit… Instead of a reward, I got new problems.”</p><br><p>“A-Adam…” Silvana bit her lip, looking at him with excitement. “What did you see?”</p><br><p>“Agh? Shouldn’t you have seen the same thing?”</p><br><br><p>“No. What’s more, as soon as your eyes lit up, I completely lost contact with you. I don’t know how to explain it, but it was as if you disappeared, at the deepest level.”</p><br><p>Silvana turned, pointing to the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>“I saw you, you were right here, but at the same time, I stopped feeling your aura and energy. Other methods didn’t work either, I couldn’t see or hear the same things you did.”</p><br><p>Adam rubbed the back of his neck with a puzzled look.</p><br><p>“Yeah, it’s all pretty strange. I saw a line made up of threads or something like that. I’m not sure if it’s my abilities or if it’s supposed to be that way, but this line looks exactly like that, and part of it is golden threads, just like the energy of the Connected Heart.”</p><br><p>Neither Silvana nor the Evolution Tree had an answer as to what this line was.</p><br><p>Adam needed help from someone more experienced, someone who had already gone through this stage.</p><br><p>“Hah.” He chuckled. “If I’m right, then I think we’ll be able to solve this problem soon. Silvana, I have to move on, I have to find out where I am and what this strange line is.”</p><br><p>Silvana nodded, and Adam left the inner space.</p><br><p>His awakening took longer than he had expected, but he couldn’t change that.</p><br><p>“Damn, I slept for a whole month? Pffft, if this continues, I might not actually be able to stop the World Wipe. No.” He shook his head with a calm expression. “I can’t let that happen. I just have to solve a few problems and go after the Dark Heart.”</p><br><p>Adam had two goals: the Dark Heart and the Desire of Beyond.</p><br><p>Although he didn’t know where the Monster Hybrids were, he understood that with the help of Silvana and the Citadel, he would be able to find them and fight them. In some ways, he expected a situation similar to what happened with Ureyn, who was a Connected Monster for him.</p><br><p>But the Desire of Beyond remained a mystery to him, and he was no closer to understanding what it was after his victory over Bathild.</p><br><br><p>The door creaked open as Adam braced himself, expecting to see Norax’s menacing gaze or something even worse.</p><br><br><p>“Shit! I can’t do this anymore!” Karso exclaimed, throwing the grater into the corner.</p><br><p>Misty turned around, wearing an apron and a large chef’s hat that tilted under its own weight.</p><br><p>“What do you mean, you can’t? You have to grate two more bowls!” She objected, waving a wooden spatula from which thick, white sauce dripped.</p><br><p>Karso’s eyes reddened. “I’ve had enough! Why do you always get to make the sauce while I have to do this boring crap?! That’s it, I’m not putting up with this anymore, I’m rebelling!”</p><br><br><p>Misty’s voice dropped several registers as her gaze became as cold as ancient ice.</p><br><p>“You want to see who’s stronger? I assure you, in this hopeless battle, you will lose all your rights.”</p><br><p>“Ha!” Karso exclaimed with excitement. “You think it will be difficult for me to defeat a pessimistic girl with a face paler than a ghost’s?!”</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The entire kitchen shook from the two auras, dark and red, that collided with each other.</p><br><p>At that moment, they noticed someone standing to the side and simultaneously turned their heads, meeting the gaze of Adam, who wasn’t sure if he had actually woken up a few minutes ago.</p><br><p>Maybe he was still asleep, and this was a dream?</p><br><p>Where was he? Who were these two?</p><br><p>‘And…’ Adam muttered internally. ‘What the hell are they doing?’</p><br><p>There were many questions, but it seemed that this time, Adam would be able to get some answers.</p><br><p>“Oh, he’s finally awake!” Karso crossed his arms over his chest. There was no trace left of his fiery call to battle.</p><br><p>Misty touched her lips with a spatula several times and nodded weakly.</p><br><p>“Yes, it seems so. However, he doesn’t know who we are. We came after he fell asleep.”</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Karso rushed forward, ending up in front of Adam.</p><br><p>“Hey! My name is Karso!” He pointed to his chest.</p><br><br><p>Misty appeared on his head, looking at Adam like a wise raven.</p><br><p>“My name is Misty, nice to meet you.”</p><br><br><p>A drop of sauce fell on Karso’s forehead, making him frown.</p><br><p>“Get off me, you stupid bitch!”</p><br><p>“Oh, no need to be so rude.”</p><br><p>Adam smiled awkwardly, scratching the back of his head.</p><br><p>‘Maybe I should go back to bed? But… Hah, it smells pretty good, whatever they’re cooking.’</p>
