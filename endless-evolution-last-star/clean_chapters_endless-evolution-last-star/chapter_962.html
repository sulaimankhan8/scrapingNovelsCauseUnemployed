            <br><p>Adam didn't have time to recover from his long and somewhat sad conversation with his Evolution Tree before he found himself amid an intense scene.</p><br><p>Risha was the first to act. She jumped up, tightly clutching the hilt of her axe. At the same time, Vorx stopped abruptly to move his great body to the right side of the river.</p><br><p>Otherwise, the massive jaws of the worms would descend directly upon him.</p><br><p>Adam, who didn't realize what was happening, had to jump up to avoid falling off Vorx's back right into the lava.</p><br><p>Sure, normally a monster like the Inferno Serpent wouldn't have to dodge the Rock Worms' attacks, but Vorx was badly injured after the battle against Adam. Many of his scales were broken or missing, revealing vulnerable flesh.</p><br><br><p>In a deft somersault, Adam found himself on a protruding rock, a burst of lava passing before his eyes but not touching him.</p><br><p>'And... What's going on here?' Adam asked his Operator.</p><br><p>Silvana's voice boomed out. 'I'm sorry. I tried to get to you, but even with a shared voice, I failed. You're too deep in thought.'</p><br><p>"Well..." he scratched the back of his head awkwardly. "I had an important conversation with my tree. Anyway, what the hell is going on here? What did I miss?"</p><br><br><p>Risha's axe plunged into the flesh of one Rock Worm, a surge of blood rushed outward, but it wasn't enough. She had to back away when the second worm tore toward her, its hundreds of teeth spinning in its jaw like a meat grinder.</p><br><p>Adam was ready to rush to the rescue, but Vorx's tail came down on the worm, knocking the huge creature to the ground.</p><br><p>'The Rock Worms, the S3 monsters. They are considerably weaker than you or Vorx, but... As you can see, there are quite a few of them,' Silvana gave him the first piece of information. 'They unexpectedly attacked you, since you were busy, you noticed it too late.'</p><br><p>Silvana coughed. 'I suggest you help them. The longer the battle against the Rock Worms goes on, the more your path at the Fallen Ring Castle will be delayed.'</p><br><br><p>Soon, a slight smile appeared on Adam's face.</p><br><p>"I have a better idea."</p><br><br><p>Adam jumped forward and turned into a flash. He didn't use his trump cards, the Wreath and the Power Gene were left for a more serious opponent.</p><br><p>'One needle and the Global Gene will be enough,' he thought before whizzing alongside the three Rock Worms.</p><br><p>In flashes of crescent light, the silver needle swept through the Rock Worms' tough armor, slicing the numerous but weak monsters apart.</p><br><p>Chunks of flesh collapsed beside Adam, some rolled down the slope, disappearing into the bottom of the lava river.</p><br><br><p>Vorx wasted no time as well. He didn't need to use his powerful abilities, the Rock Worms were a far cry from Adam in the power matter.</p><br><p>With each swing, his tail like a whip turned the Rock Worms into chop steaks, shattering their stone layer with ease.</p><br><p>"Damn, same thing again..." Adam shook his head, watching Risha, who was struggling against the two Rock Worms.</p><br><p>In fact, those were the last worms all the others Adam and Vorx had already dealt with.</p><br><br><p>A shiver went through Vorx's tail, he was going to help Risha. One sweep would be enough to break the worm in two.</p><br><p>At the last moment, Adam's hand touched his tail, throwing it into the lava in a sharp motion.</p><br><p>Then, Adam found himself on a rock, in front of Vorx, who stared at him in bewilderment.</p><br><p>"Why? I don't argue, that girl can be annoying sometimes... but do you dislike her so much that you want to kill her?" he looked at the Rock Worms. "We could kill them in a heartbeat. There's no point in spending more than a few minutes on it."</p><br><br><p>"Hmm?" Vorx was confused.</p><br><p>Adam pointed at Risha, she swung her axe fending off one worm, but a second one immediately attacked her from the side.</p><br><p>"I want her to get stronger. Right here and now."</p><br><p>Vorx snorted irritably. "That's too naive of you. You won't succeed."</p><br><p>"Hah, maybe, but I still want her to try," Adam leaned on his hand, a sly smile playing across his face. "I don't know if you saw our fight against the lizards in detail or just sensed our auras, but she had trouble against the S3 monster. Those worms are just as much S3 monsters as that lizard, but so far, she's holding her own."</p><br><p>His words failed to change Vorx's mind. He wanted to kill the Rock Worms.</p><br><p>Adam chuckled. "She's a resident of the Lower Ring, I'm sure it's humiliating for her to realize that I've already overtaken her. She's willing to do anything to get stronger and all she needs to open the third lesser gate is energy. Energy straight from her Evolution Tree."</p><br><br><p>Vorx glanced at him.</p><br><p>"What's your plan? How long are you going to wait for her progress?"</p><br><p>"Not that long," Adam shrugged nonchalantly. "When we arrive at the castle, we'll have a safe place, so healing her wounds won't be a problem."</p><br><p>Then, his gaze grew darker, overlooking Risha's desperate attempts to win.</p><br><p>"Here's the deal - we'll only help her when she's in mortal danger. Until then, we will observe. If the worm's attack doesn't kill her and she's still breathing, then we're nothing more than mere observers."</p><br><p>"Tsk..." Vorx grunted irritably. "I don't like the idea... but... I agree."</p><br><br><br><p>Ten minutes later, Risha was full of blood, her own and the worms continued to fight. Their sharp teeth and lunges left numerous cuts on her body.</p><br><p>Clots of blood falling from her axe indicated heavy worm wounds, but she was already at her limit.</p><br><br><p>With a heavy breath, Risha wheezed.</p><br><p>"These two freaks are just smirking and waiting for me to die here! But... I have to win or else Kreyna will just crush me like a bug!"</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a bright light burst out from her Evolution Tree as the energy channeled toward the two parts of her power.</p><br><p>The red, bloody root and the eerie, hovering skull in the distance trembled.</p><br><p>This only caused Risha to have smile full of happiness.</p><br>
