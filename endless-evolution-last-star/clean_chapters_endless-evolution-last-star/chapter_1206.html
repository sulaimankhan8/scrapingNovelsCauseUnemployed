            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1206: Wrong Ability (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A tremor from a single blow passed through the ground, reaching even the lower levels of the Kirani Colony.</p><br><p>Fromund whistled, looking up as if he could understand what was happening dozens of meters below.</p><br><p>‘Well, well. Looks like she’s not as easy as Adam thought, right?’</p><br><p>‘Don’t worry, he’ll be fine. Bathild probably used the power of the storm, which is why she pulled him to the surface. But that was her last trump card. Once Adam adapts to this, his victory will not be long in coming.’ Arayna’s reassuring voice rang out.</p><br><p>At that time, neither she nor Fromund knew that their information about Bathild’s abilities was incomplete. Sure, she didn’t have a title, but as an Elder ruling over a territory close to the Dark Shore, she had everything she needed to evolve quickly.</p><br><p>What Bathild had shown was at her limit, but she was ready to go to extreme measures if necessary to win.</p><br><p>Usually, monsters had a different goal — they wanted to kill their opponent and eat them. Sure, if Adam lost, he would die, but Bathild behaved like a warrior thirsty for recognition, not a mindless beast.</p><br><p>But some of the monsters under her command could be very different.</p><br><br><p>From afar, from an inconspicuous passageway, came the sound of many footsteps.</p><br><p>Fromund’s grin was unmistakable. He knew that monsters were approaching him as well, he needed to be patient, and it was finally happening.</p><br><p>Ahead was a man with black hair in a long cloak covering his frame and two slits on his back like torn wings, inside which electrical discharges could be seen along with flames.</p><br><p>Behind Marhen, a dozen monsters appeared. All of them were at the Black Threat Level. Several of them were strong enough to be Lesser Elders, while others were weaker.</p><br><p>However, this could only be good news for Fromund.</p><br><br><p>Arayna nodded in confirmation.</p><br><p>“Yes, there can be no doubt about it. I don’t sense any other auras, and most likely, like Bathild, these monsters have arrived from the Thunder Peaks. That’s the territory neighboring the Corrupted Volcano.”</p><br><p>Fromund took a deep breath as he stepped forward.</p><br><p>“So I have to fight her minions? Those weaklings?”</p><br><p>This time, Fromund decided to say it out loud, loud enough for every monster to hear.</p><br><p>Perhaps he shouldn’t have provoked his enemies, but Fromund knew that battle was inevitable.</p><br><p>Even if Marhen and the thunder monsters didn’t want to fight him and suddenly became pacifists, Fromund would simply attack them.</p><br><p>He was angry that Adam was the first to get the chance to fight a powerful monster, that Bathild, an Elder, had come here to fight him, Adam Vinter.</p><br><p>Obviously, Fromund wanted the same treatment. It would be recognition of his strength, not from his allies, but from his enemies—the monsters.</p><br><p>Sometimes, the opinion of an enemy was far more valuable than that of an ally, as it was likely to be as sincere as possible.</p><br><br><p>Fromund swung his spear, smashing the ground as he stepped forward.</p><br><p>“Alright, which one of you is the boss? You?!” Fromund pointed his spear at Marhen.</p><br><p>“Yes, my name is Marhen, I am a subordinate of Miss Bathild, and you are…?”</p><br><p>“Fromund! Fuck! Fromund Aegler! Remember my name and tell everyone!”</p><br><p>In response, the other monsters laughed.</p><br><p>“Hahahahaha! Looks like someone’s jealous of his friend, isn’t he?”</p><br><p>“Just look at his face! Does he even know what he’s talking about?”</p><br><p>His friend chuckled. “Of course not. He thinks someone will remember his name when it doesn’t matter because he’ll be dead soon!”</p><br><p>Before Marhen could give the order, two thunder monsters rushed forward.</p><br><p>One of them had a thick, spiky tail, and the other had a single crooked horn. Not all of them had lightning abilities, but most did.</p><br><p>Electric discharges ran through the second monster, filling its horn with power. At the same time, gusts of wind rushed toward the first monster, making it faster and turning its tail into a sharp blade.</p><br><p>Marhen reached out, intending to stop the two. This was not the start of the battle he had expected.</p><br><p>‘Tsk, two idiots!’ Marhen exclaimed inwardly. ‘Don’t they understand that if this is Adam Vinter’s partner, he’s almost as strong as him!’</p><br><p>Marhen expected to see Fromund easily deal with the two monsters, as they weren’t strong enough to be considered Lesser Elders.</p><br><p>But the next scene made his eyes widen in disbelief.</p><br><br><p>Two strikes, wind and lightning, came down on Fromund from different sides as he raised his spear to block them.</p><br><p>He managed to do so, but the two monsters were already in front of him, attacking him directly in the stomach.</p><br><p>At the last moment, Fromund swung his spear, taking no damage, but their attacks sent a powerful impulse through his body.</p><br><p>The impact threw Fromund back, embedding him in the rock several meters away.</p><br><p>“Yes!” the first monster exclaimed joyfully.</p><br><p>The second grinned, staring intently at the smoke screen.</p><br><p>The calmer monsters turned to Marhen, waiting for his decision.</p><br><p>‘Hmm, is this Fromund really that weak? I can feel his aura, he’s alive, but… if he couldn’t handle these two, he doesn’t stand a chance against me and the others, not to mention Bathild.’</p><br><br><p>A fragment flew out of the smoke screen, but the second monster easily caught it before crushing it.</p><br><p>“Come on, Fromun Aegler! Show us what you’re capable of, you strong Phantom! Hahaha!” He exclaimed mockingly.</p><br><br><p>With a calm stride, bearing no wounds on his body, Fromund stepped forward. Their attack had not harmed him in the slightest, but then again, there were only two of them, and they were not the strongest.</p><br><p>Marhen and the other monsters looked at Fromund’s hand, which for some reason was raised.</p><br><p>Then, Fromund raised his gaze and blinked several times, puzzled.</p><br><p>‘Fuuuuck… I’m underground! I didn’t think of that!’</p><br><p>The monsters didn’t know what was happening, only Fromund and Arayna understood the whole problem, and all Arayna could do was roll her eyes and touch her temples.</p><br><p>She couldn’t believe how anyone could do something so stupid.</p>
