            <br><p>Silvana always tried to predict where Adam's actions would lead so that she could control the risks.</p><br><p>However, she failed to do so at the Twilight Palace because she didn't have enough information.</p><br><p>After being here for a few days she came to some conclusions, but it was too late.</p><br><p>"Agh... Anyway, from what I understand, nobles don't just need to collect five coins, they need a perfect score."</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head, curiosity mixed with puzzlement.</p><br><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yes. Look, every Phantom starts their journey here with three twilight coins," she showed three fingers, "That means the best outcome of events is two wins to collect five coins and leave the hotel without a single loss."</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Silvana continued.</p><br><p>"However, the quality of the fights also matters. I mean, it's much better to win a difficult fight than an opponent who is much weaker than you. In a perfect scenario, you want to face someone you'll fight on equal footing and win with your unique solutions to show everyone how different you are from the others."</p><br><p>Silvana waved her arm slightly, taking the cup by the handle.</p><br><p>"Do that twice, gain attention and a reputation as a strong warrior, and leave Twilight Palace with pride in yourself and full confidence that your family will appreciate your results. At least I think that's the mindset of the nobles here."</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, Silvana beat him to it:</p><br><p>"Obviously, not a clean score of only wins or a loss is a disaster, but there's something else the nobles wouldn't want to face."</p><br><br><p>Silvana pointed at Adam, her eyes stern.</p><br><p>"No one would want to get a victory against someone who surrendered on purpose. It's even worse than defeating a weak opponent who had no chance of winning in the first place."</p><br><p>Adam scratched his cheek in confusion, listening to Silvana's thoughts.</p><br><p>"Just think about it. Not only do you get a low-quality win, but you don't even know if you deserve it. What if your opponent who gave up on purpose was actually strong enough to defeat you?"</p><br><p>"In that case, you lose some of your opportunity to show what you're capable of and the other nobles realize that."</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Silvana moved to a conclusion.</p><br><p>"All in all, because you gave up in the fight against Spiro Lorenzo, no one else will want to fight against you. The nobles don't need such victories, because they won't get any satisfaction or respect from the high society for it."</p><br><p>Adam's face froze for a while, his eyes wide in shock.</p><br><p>Now that Silvana had explained everything, things were starting to fall into place.</p><br><p>"Fuck... You're right..."</p><br><p>Silvana folded her arms in a lock.</p><br><p>"Unfortunately yes. We were unlucky that Spiro Lorenzo showed up so early. We didn't take into account that unlike you, the nobles are in no hurry to leave the Twilight Palace as soon as possible."</p><br><p>"That's not good at all, you know?"</p><br><p>Adam looked up, his blank gaze staring up at the ceiling.</p><br><p>"If no one wants to fight me, then what are we supposed to do? Maybe I should just try to convince them?"</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head promptly.</p><br><p>"That's out of the question," she stated sternly, "The problem is that you have two more coins, not just one. Perhaps, if we're very lucky, you'll be able to talk another nobleman into it."</p><br><p>"You're going to lose on purpose again. Even if you try to hide it, it will soon become clear to everyone that you used the same trick twice. The third time, no one will fight against you knowing that you'll ruin their reputation with your surrender."</p><br><p>Taking a heavy sigh, Silvana crossed her arms over her chest.</p><br><p>"All in all, I think we have only one decent option - find a noble willing to fight you despite the Spiro Lorenzo story and win. Then, do likewise two more times."</p><br><p>Upon hearing her conclusion, Adam grabbed his head with both hands.</p><br><p>"Damn it! I wanted to finish this quickly, but now instead of two victories, I need three? Fucking nobles! Even if they ignore you, they still give you tons of trouble!"</p><br><p>Silvana spread her arms to the sides.</p><br><p>"I'm afraid there's nothing more we can do."</p><br><p>"That doesn't sound optimistic at all."</p><br><p>"Well..." Silvana stretched out, "Because our situation is far from good."</p><br><p>"And where should we look for this Phantom? I mean, I'm willing to fight anyone, but who would want to take the risk and see if I give up this time or not?"</p><br><p>Silvana didn't have an answer to that question. In fact, that was the next thing she was planning to do, otherwise they would be stuck here for a long time.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, distinct footsteps sounded from outside, someone approaching them in a steady gait.</p><br><p>Adam paid no attention, but Silvana's eyes twitched to the side.</p><br><p>Soon, behind a frowning Adam, a serious voice rang out:</p><br><p>"Just as I thought, you'll be at this café this morning, too. Do you like the desserts here so much or do you just don't care as much as your victories?"</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam thought the voice sounded familiar, though he couldn't figure out who it belonged to.</p><br><p>Turning around, he saw Giselle towering over him. Her face was impassive, her gaze proud and stern.</p><br><br><p>Then, Giselle looked down at the empty chair by their table.</p><br><p>"Do you mind if I sit down?"</p><br><p>Silvana couldn't refuse her. Their status differed greatly, as Phantom and Operator, and as commoner and high noble, but Giselle behaved respectfully, with dignity.</p><br><p>"S-Sure..." she stammered pushing back her chair.</p><br><br><p>With a slight nod, Giselle took a seat across from Adam.</p><br><p>"I'll get right to the point," she pronounced, her gray eyes staring at him, "Unlike the other nobles here, I've heard of you Adam Vinter. I want my last victory to be memorable, to have you as my opponent."</p><br><p>Adam's eyebrow went up.</p><br><p>Giselle quickly added:</p><br><p>"However, I have one condition. I need you to do something so I can be sure of the quality of our fight."</p><br>
