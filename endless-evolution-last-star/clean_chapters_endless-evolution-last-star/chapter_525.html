            <br><p>"What the hell... Did my coat repair itself?" Adam muttered in disbelief, checking the cut to make sure.</p><br><p>Franz nodded deeply in confirmation.</p><br><p>"Yeah, and not just your coat, all elements of your clothing, from your shirt to your boots. However, this feature has serious limitations."</p><br><p>Adam raised his gaze to Franz.</p><br><p>Franz pointed to the side, to a random roll of cloth hanging on the wall.</p><br><p>"You'll only be able to repair damage of small sizes, and unless your clothing has lost a piece of fabric or leather. These threads sew the pieces of fabric together just as your skin regenerates, taking away the cut."</p><br><p>Franz shrugged with a slight sigh.</p><br><p>"That way, if you lose a sleeve during battle or monsters rip off part of your pants, you won't be able to regrow them. However... If the situation is really bad, you can contact Rosalind and she will connect you with our tailor. This time the service will be paid and very expensive."</p><br><p>Adam nodded, looking to see if anything happened to his clothes when he used his abilities.</p><br><p>'Indeed... No damage at all. The suit made of ordinary materials could tear just from me straining my muscles. But, nothing happened to these clothes even when using the abilities.'</p><br><p>Then, Adam glanced around the room, at the various outfits prepared for Franz and Rosalind for different occasions.</p><br><p>'Well, otherwise, the clothes of strong Phantoms would tear from simple movement during fights, even those made of durable elastic materials.'</p><br><p>Adam realized that besides price and exclusivity, there was another deterrent factor that kept weaker Phantoms from getting clothes stitched with monster threads. Experience exclusive tales on empire</p><br><p>Only when a Phantom reached K2-Level did he gain the ability to use the Energy Control. Without this unique feature, the usefulness of such clothes was greatly diminished, especially considering how much it cost.</p><br><p>"Franz, I understand regardless of their level, Light Noble, that is, Phantom Nobles, wear this kind of clothing, right?"</p><br><p>Franz spread his arms to the side with a faint smile.</p><br><p>"Yeah, although it's not that useful for K0 and K1 Phantoms, but if you have enough money and connections for it, why not? I'm ashamed to admit it, but I used to wear such clothes myself. Well, the life of a nobleman has its advantages."</p><br><p>Adam's corners of his lips went up when he pulled to his shoulder and tugged at the cape, causing it to tear off the rivets.</p><br><p>Adam stared at the emblem of the Balo Family for a while before turning to Franz and saying: "Well, it's certainly worth it, isn't it? By taking this thing with me, I'm getting a lot in return." Adam smiled.</p><br><p>Then, his gaze filled with sadness and his voice grew darker.</p><br><p>"It turns out that it's only because of your desire for revenge that hundreds of people in the slums got a chance to improve their lives. If you didn't want revenge, none of this would have happened."</p><br><p>Adam raised his head, looking up at the luxurious chandelier illuminating the room.</p><br><p>"Good was born out of evil, and even so, this good is pure, people whose lives will be improved by Yellow Shark stores will think they're just lucky. Fuck, that's kind of depressing."</p><br><p>Franz and Rosalind didn't reply anything, they only glanced at each other. For them, this sort of thing had become commonplace long ago.</p><br><p>They realized that it was impossible to do only good or bad things. It was only possible if one always turned a blind eye to the consequences of one's actions, which always only led to disaster.</p><br><p>"Khm." Rosalind coughed. "If we've got the clothes sorted out, I think we should go over the details again, after which you can go home."</p><br><p>Adam nodded, attaching the cape to his right shoulder. The rivets were strong, so they had no trouble keeping the cape in place.</p><br><br><p>After a few hours, which besides the plan of action included small talk and tea with desserts, Adam and Silvana got ready to leave.</p><br><p>"Wait, Adam, take your time." Franz stopped them with a wave of his hand.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Haven't we already discussed everything we can? Furthermore..." Adam looked outside the window, night already descended as the stars shone brightly in the dark sky. "It's pretty late, I don't want to disrupt the regimen when there's only one day left before the battle."</p><br><p>Franz nodded deeply, his hands folded into his sleeves.</p><br><p>"Sure, you have to be at the peak of your strength to win. But... Don't you have one more thing to do before that?"</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, it seemed Franz was talking about something obvious, but Adam didn't understand what it was about.</p><br><p>"The First Wall, 99.3%, right? Another 0.7% to pass the first part and reach the limit of the W0-Stage. It's just necessary to keep your powers at the same level in evolutionary terms."</p><br><p>Not immediately answering, Adam scratched the back of his head.</p><br><p>"So... You think I can do that right now? You want me to hit the First Wall here?"</p><br><p>"Almost." Franz's corners of his lips went up, forming a sly smile.</p><br><br><p>A cold wind current passed next to Silvana's hair, blowing over her skin and moving on to Rosalind and Franz who stood beside her.</p><br><p>They were on the shore of the lake that was hundreds of meters away from Franz's mansion. It was no longer his private territory, but people rarely came here.</p><br><p>If someone wanted to see the beautiful and vast nature, they went to the Second Ring, not to the far side of the eighth wing, which almost no one knew about, as there were only mansions and estates of noblemen and rich people around.</p><br><p>In the center of the spacious lake with pale water, there was a small island, where even a two-room house could not fit.</p><br><p>However... for one person there was more than enough room.</p><br><p>Adam stared at the reflection of the starry sky on the surface of the water surrounding him on all sides.</p><br><p>Three figures stood in the distance, waiting for him to act when he could finally break the First Wall.</p><br><p>"Well..." Adam clenched his fist raising his gaze to see the massive blue moon, "If I do it now I won't have to worry about anything else but the battle."</p>
