            <br><p>The difference in power was a concept that everyone was familiar with, whether it was an ordinary person or a Phantom. No K1-Phantom would attack K2 One, as there was no chance of victory.</p><br><p>However, when a K1-Phantom fought against another K1-Phantom, no one thought about the serious difference in might, especially a person like Iren.</p><br><p>She was sure that she was stronger than Adam, but something didn't go according to plan.</p><br><p>In a way, she was unlucky that Adam had Elemental Root at its base with gravity, but only the weak could blame bad luck for defeat.</p><br><p>Before Iren could realize anything, Adam's hand fell on her face, clutching her head tightly.</p><br><p>Iren's terrified eyes met Adam's serene gaze as electric shocks passed in front of him, descending to his feet.</p><br><p>Then, Adam quickly ran forward, holding Iren in front of him with only the strength of his grip. Everything was happening extremely fast, and due to the shock, Iren didn't have time to react to such brazen actions from her opponent.</p><br><br><p>Adam drove Iren into the iron wall, the metal plates breaking from her back. Iren's pupils narrowed several times as if showing how bright the pain was.</p><br><p>"Bastard!" Romeo shouted, and at the same moment, an ice arrow headed towards Adam, whizzing through the wind.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes shifted to the right as he jerked his head away, letting the arrow fly in front of him.</p><br><br><p>Iren took that moment to kick Adam in the stomach and free herself from his grip.</p><br><p>Soon, everyone stood next to Iren, preparing for battle. It wasn't right for the Phantoms to fight against each other, but they were humans first of all - it was inherent for humans to fight, always and everywhere, no matter who they were fighting.</p><br><p>Adam frowned slightly. It was not in his plans to fight with them at all, especially five at once.</p><br><p>"You too?" Adam asked, staring at the man with the shield. It was obvious from the look on his face that he wasn't thrilled with the way the situation had turned out, but he had no other choice.</p><br><p>The man sighed heavily, "I'm sorry, but they're my mates, I can't stand aside when someone attacked our leader."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply. In a way, he even respected that statement.</p><br><p>"Wait... Give me another chance..." Iren waved her hand, not wanting to admit defeat. This was a big blow to her.</p><br><p>"Iren... You... you can't handle him alone!" Romeo said worriedly, he couldn't bear to watch Iren suffer any longer.</p><br><p>"SHUT UP!!!!" Iren shouted, pushing him aside. From the unexpected, Romeo fell to the ground with a shocked expression.</p><br><p>Iren threw him a scornful stare before turning around to step forward, heading towards Adam.</p><br><p>'Well, well, how cruel.' Silvana muttered, leaning on her arm with a bored look, 'His innocent eyes don't deserve to be filled with resentment. It's sad about the whole thing.'</p><br><p>Adam only nodded slightly. He was lucky, he had never been in a relationship with a woman like Romeo did, or rather... it wasn't even a relationship.</p><br><p>He was willing to do anything for her, and she not only didn't notice it but quietly disregarded it.</p><br><p>"You know, he's right. You can't beat me. I think you've noticed that I've barely used my powers, so... if we fight seriously, you won't just lose - you'll die." Adam muttered with a calm look, but his words were as cold as the wind blowing across his face.</p><br><p>Irene gulped. Somehow, she felt that Adam wasn't trying to scare her, he was saying what might happen.</p><br><p>"Tsk. Even if you're telling the truth, it doesn't matter." Iren waved her hand with a confident smirk on her face, "I've spent a lot of time learning something special. I'm sure you haven't even heard of it, and neither have the rest of them."</p><br><p>At the same moment, Iren extended her hand forward and a purple glow began to emanate from her, like quivering magnetic waves seeking to engulf everything around her.</p><br><p>Then, Iren's aura turned into a huge spear, majestic and powerful, capable of piercing any target in a single thrust - crushing down everything in its path.</p><br><p>'Damn, so she can use aura? What's more, it's a First Stage Spirit. I wonder where a girl with a perfect reputation learned it? Clearly, not in prison like me.' Adam inwardly uttered.</p><br><p>Iren expected to see a shocked or even horrified expression on Adam's face, but... All she got was that he shoved his hands in his pockets, spreading his shoulders wide.</p><br><p>'What...? Doesn't he feel the pressure from my aura...? Why is that bastard so calm? Iren muttered to herself, her fingertips trembling, 'Whatever! It doesn't matter! If I wound him with my aura, I can win!</p><br><p>He won't be able to defend himself against Spirit!'</p><br><br><p>Oddly enough, Iren's aura attracted unwanted guests to their battle. A multitude of monsters from Rusty Ruins, including Assassin Harpies, appeared on top of the iron structures.</p><br><p>Adam looked around. There was no one as strong as Firebreathing Trinadon among the monsters, but there were actually a lot of them - it was a dangerous amount.</p><br><p>'What an idiot...' Silvana muttered through gritted teeth, 'She's the reason you're all in danger now. Her aura isn't strong enough to scare the monsters, so... she just involved them!'</p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily, glancing to the side.</p><br><p>"And? Did you achieve that? There are at least forty monsters here, I'm sure there will be more soon, and it's all your weak aura's fault." Adam said calmly, raising his voice on the last words.</p><br><p>"What? A weak aura? They came here because my aura is strong! I'll prove it to you!" Iren exclaimed before launching her spear straight at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, but not from the fact that Iren's aura was dangerous but because of her careless action.</p><br><p>"Holy shit... We're surrounded by monsters and she keeps attacking me to prove her point. How can she even have a good reputation? She's a horrible Phantom!" Adam growled as his eyes flared.</p><br><p>Adam realized that now he had to solve two problems at once - to subdue Iren, but not to kill her, and also to banish the monsters that were waiting for a good time.</p><br><p>The monsters were like kites, waiting for the right moment to attack.</p><br><p>They intended to do it a little later when Adam or Iren would be injured since these two were the strongest of the humans here.</p><br><p>Adam began to release his aura - immediately making it to full power.</p><br><p>Before Iren's purple spear could reach its target, it stopped unable to advance any further, as if it had encountered an insurmountable obstacle.</p><br><p>"What is that...?" The man with the shield muttered in disbelief, looking at the ghostly creature made up of thousands of silver threads.</p><br><p>Adam's Spirit raised his left hand high, which was identical to Adam's Second Order, a silver gauntlet with claws.</p><br><p>Thus, Adam's aura headed upwards, only to descend on the monsters around them, unleashing its pressure upon them.</p><br><p>Light Rain squad was no exception, as well as Iren. The snow-white aura, simply pinned her to the ground, not allowing her to move.</p><br><p>Adam didn't pierce the Light Rain squad with his aura, it wasn't his goal to hurt them, because if they didn't possess The Will, they could pass out after hitting by Adam's aura.</p><br><p>In that case, Adam would have practically sentenced them to death, which he obviously didn't want to do.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Some monsters started to release their auras, it wasn't The Will, because such weak monsters didn't have Aura Seal built yet.</p><br><p>However, it was clearly not enough to break through Adam's auras.</p><br><p>Unlike other abilities, the aura had the unique feature of simultaneously attacking an almost limitless number of targets.</p><br><p>Sure, because Adam spread his aura to all directions at once, his aura became less dense, but it was more than enough to get through the defense of the monsters.</p><br><p>Thus, dozens of monsters received significant internal damage, dark blood came out of their jaws, some fell from the top of the building, rolling down the rusty dust below, and those who were stronger were able to stand on their feet and quickly run away.</p><br><p>"That's enough..." Adam muttered with a slightly weakened voice. Even though he didn't want to, he had to spend some energy to use Artifact Traits and summon his Spirit.</p><br><p>The aura attack alone wasn't enough to kill even one monster, even the weakest one, but Adam achieved his goal - frightened by his power, the monsters ran away, not wanting to stay here anymore.</p><br><br><p>Adam slowly approached Iren, who was too weak to stand on her feet, she needed some time to recover.</p><br><p>Adam's black boots appeared in front of Iren's eyes as she hesitantly raised her head, facing his calm gaze.</p><br><p>"I don't know where you learned this, but your aura looks fake, otherwise, the monsters wouldn't consider you an easy target." Adam uttered, stepping aside and glaring at Romeo.</p><br><p>"It's none of my business, but if I were you, I'd stop running after her like a helpless puppy. The most important person in your life shouldn't be a narcissistic bitch with reality perception problems, but your Operator." Adam said confidently as if repeating Tron's words.</p><br><p>Silvana didn't react in any way when she heard it, or rather, she didn't show it to Adam, but... her cheeks flushed slightly. Even she couldn't contain her emotions when someone called her the most important person in his life.</p><br><p>For many, it was the highest praise.</p>
