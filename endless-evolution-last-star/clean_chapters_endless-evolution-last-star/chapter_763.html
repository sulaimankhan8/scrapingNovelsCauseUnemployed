            <br><p>More than a hundred Phantoms were actively defending the fortress, but at one moment, two shadows ran out from the side of the gate. One had a large sword behind his back, and the other had a long black staff.</p><br><p>They immediately activated their auras at full power, keeping their spirits close to themselves.</p><br><p>Their task was not to kill or injure the nearby monsters but to remove their desire to attack. It worked, none of the monsters attacked Viron and Gnash, though they were solo, running in different directions, surrounded by dozens of monsters.</p><br><p>The strongest ones were either, fighting each other at the ice towers or were too cautious to act prematurely. The weaker ones realized that against Viron and Gnash, they didn't stand a chance.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, the Grim Warro and the Silent Droao realized that they could no longer be watchers. The two Phantoms moved to each chosen opponent.</p><br><p>Ripple. Ripple. Ripple.</p><br><p>The Silent Droao's water surface trembled slightly, the strange creature was unhappy with the trouble ahead.</p><br><p>But, the Grim Warro was of a completely different opinion.</p><br><br><p>His grin grew wider with each leap Viron's made. Lately, the Grim Warro became bored, to him, it was worse than death. After the Dormant Lord killed the Flame Raider, the Grim Warro had no way to entertain himself, it was all about the outcome of one major battle.</p><br><p>Yet, a great way to relieve his boredom was coming to him. It couldn't help but make him happy.</p><br><p>"Gha... ha... hahaha!"</p><br><p>The Grim Warro exclaimed in excitement, raising his hands in the air. Streams of green flame burst out of the sand, burning away the layers of snow brought by the frost of the ice towers.</p><br><p>Viron only nodded slightly, continuing to move forward.</p><br><p>'Good, if you were running away from me then that made things difficult, I'll deal with you quickly. The most important thing is that she doesn't screw up... A second failure could be our last.'</p><br><p>At the same time, Gnash stopped a hundred meters away from the Silent Droao. The drop-shaped monster hovered above the hilltop, its three azure orbs slowly circling, seeing Gnash as a target for destruction.</p><br><p>Yet, the Silent Droao was in no hurry to attack. Unlike Grim Warro, it preferred to quietly wait for the best-case scenario, Gnash was not part of its plans.</p><br><p>An arrogant smirk appeared on Gnash's face as she slowly pointed her staff directly at the Silent Droao. There were many of the same monsters around, not Essence Type, but they didn't bother Gnash.</p><br><p>"Hah, hoping that I'll just leave and you can save your energy? Whatever, I came here to kill you, and I'm used to accomplishing missions!"</p><br><p>With a fiery shout, Gnash's aura quickly peaked when her purple eyes shone brightly. Energy in electrical discharges traveled down her staff as above the Silent Droao, a palm-sized black sphere appeared in the sky.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With an active shudder, a second sphere sprung up nearby, then another and another, until the total number reached seven - that was the maximum for Gnash, at least if she didn't want to get hurt.</p><br><p>The Silent Droao directed her gaze upwards, eyeing the spheres curiously, somehow they were floating in the air.</p><br><p>Not wanting to risk the Silent Droao's azure orbs spun around, releasing shots of compressed water, powerful enough to kill the Grim Warro on an accurate hit.</p><br><p>"Hah, did you think it would be that easy?"</p><br><p>Tilting her staff downward, Gnash activated the black spheres. The purple waves came out from each, becoming more active and faster in a split second.</p><br><p>Then, the Silent Droao's water shots shuddered and froze in midair as if faced with an invisible wall between the ground and the spheres.</p><br><p>Gnash glanced at the multitude of drop monsters trapped in the water spheres, anticipating her imminent victory.</p><br><p>"It's time to fall to the ground!"</p><br><p>At the same moment, the ripples coming from the spheres grew stronger, unleashing a powerful gravitational pressure on the Silent Droao and its followers.</p><br><p>Several of the Silent Droao that were in the most dangerous places exploded immediately, blue water mixing with bloody shards of flesh as they flew away to sink into the snow.</p><br><p>The monsters attacked again trying to destroy Gnash's black spheres, but gravity was too strong, moreover as long as Gnash had the energy she could continue to increase the force.</p><br><p>The Essence Silent Droao remained in relative normalcy, but it couldn't get rid of the spheres as long as Gnash was here.</p><br><p>"Well, it looks like it's going to be easy, especially with all the amplification we've gotten from our supports. I wonder how our silent handsome guy is doing?"</p><br><p>Turning around for a second, Gnash looked north over her shoulder. From this distance, she couldn't see the details of the battle, but she could discern the burning light clashing with the green flames and black roots of the Grim Warro.</p><br><p>Viron didn't hold back, he fought at full strength to prevent the monster from severely injuring himself or escaping. It was a condition for them to survive.</p><br><p>"Good... Looks like I should hurry up if I want to get back to the fortress before he does. It'll be funny to see his face when he comes back wounded, and I'm already inside."</p><br><p>Then, the smirk disappeared from her face as she became more serious returning to her opponent. The Essence Silent Droao was not a weak monster, she could not defeat it with a single gravity ability.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the two strong monsters slowly rose to their feet, preparing for one last battle before completing the ritual.</p><br><p>Deep beneath the fortress, in the depths of the bloody river, in the center of the bloody circle, the Solitary Commander and the Mighty Commander directed their gazes at Adam.</p><br><p>Their eyes were red, devoid of meaning and will of their own.</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam muttered looking at the upgraded versions of the enemies he had defeated, "You weren't resurrected, your bodies are just being used, because you didn't even recognize me, right?"</p><br><p>There was no response, but Adam saw everything in their eyes full of nothing but cruelty and bloodlust.</p><br><p>Between the Solitary Commander's armor and the rips in the Mighty Commander's tough hide, could be seen moving vines holding the two monsters under their control.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, this was a fight he didn't like.</p><br><p>"Fine, I'll make this quick, I respect my enemies, unlike your future overlord..."</p>
