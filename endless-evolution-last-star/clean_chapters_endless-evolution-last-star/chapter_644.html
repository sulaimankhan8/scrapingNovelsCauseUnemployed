            <br><br><p>Douglas set aside his cup of coffee, quickly looked at the paperwork, and shifted his gaze to Silvana, she sat across from him with a calm face.</p><br><p>This was the first time they had met, but not for Adam. He looked at Douglas with slight surprise.</p><br><p>'Damn, it's been over five years since that day, but he hasn't changed at all. Not that I've seen him very often, but... I feel like I'll look completely different in five years.' Adam thought for a moment.</p><br><br><p>Douglas started first.</p><br><p>"You were sent to me by Ceska? She warned me that she wanted me to meet someone she knew, but... I didn't think it would be a 14-year-old girl."</p><br><p>His eyebrow rose, he expected Silvana to respond or at least have some sort of reaction, only silence. Discover hidden stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Kmh." Douglas coughed, "From the looks of it, you want to ask me for something. In that case, I'll warn myself right away, I'm a military man, not a wizard. I don't grant wishes, but I can listen to your request and maybe I can do something about it."</p><br><br><p>Silvana said slowly in a deep voice.</p><br><p>"My request is very simple - I want your help to enroll me in Operator Academy. I'm 14 years old, the academic year hasn't started yet, I'm eligible. Also, I have the money to pay for the first year, but... that's my limit."</p><br><p>Even an experienced military man like Douglas who mostly worked at the Citadel didn't often encounter this kind of request.</p><br><br><p>Douglas hummed, crossed his arms over his chest, and with closed eyes was silent for a few moments.</p><br><p>Then, nodding slightly a few times, Douglas glanced at Silvana.</p><br><p>"Why? Answer my question and I'll give you the answer as well."</p><br><p>"Phantoms... I feel sorry for them..." Silvana sincerely said with a cold, emotionless expression.</p><br><p>She bit her lip as her gaze grew darker.</p><br><p>"It's unlikely I'll become a Phantom, I realize the chances of that are too slim and... I don't want to. I don't think I'd be a good monster killer, but I could be a great assistant. That's for sure."</p><br><p>Douglas was silent, he was listening intently to Silvana, the speech of a 14-year-old girl who was saying things that most adults didn't understand.</p><br><p>"A few days ago, I wasn't 100% sure, but... when I found myself on the verge of rejection due to financial constraints, I realized this is what I needed."</p><br><p>Clenching her fists tightly, Silvana raised her head staring intently at Douglas, her green eyes growing deeper:</p><br><p>"To protect the Phantoms and help them kill monsters."</p><br><p>Douglas smiled widely as he chuckled loudly:</p><br><p>"Hahaha, Protect the Phantoms?" Douglas shook his head, "Girl, do you even realize how strong they are and what they're capable of? Especially some of them..."</p><br><p>Yet, Douglas's remark didn't change Silvana's stare in any way.</p><br><p>"Monsters are strong too. Monsters don't have supporters, but they don't need them since they're simply hundreds of times more numerous."</p><br><br><p>Douglas put his fingertips together, stomping slowly.</p><br><p>"Fine, I'll think about what I can do. Come back here at the same time in three days. Then you'll know if you can become an Operator or if you should focus on something else."</p><br><p>"Thank you." Silvana bowed low before heading for the exit.</p><br><p>As she touched the doorknob, Douglas's heavy voice sounded behind her.</p><br><p>"And, one more thing. Operators, they're not assistants or support. They're partners and to some Phantoms in the fullest sense of the word..."</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Silvana blushed, she was already old enough and smart enough to understand the meaning of Douglas's words.</p><br><p>Before leaving to follow Silvana, Adam turned around glaring at Douglas.</p><br><p>"Damn... So he influenced both of our paths? I became a Phantom without him, but... he's the one who helped me become part of the system."</p><br><br><p>The next meeting with Douglas, Silvana was looking forward more than anything. It was her last chance, as her money was limited, and asking for help from Ceska and Evor was no longer an option.</p><br><p>Thus, as she walked down the corridor three days after their conversation, her legs shook slightly and her heart beat rapidly.</p><br><p>The military and employees passing her by paid no attention. If she was here it was because she needed to be, no matter that she wasn't military and was a teenager.</p><br><p>Slowly, with a creak the door opened letting Silvana into Douglas's office. Unlike her, he was relaxed, sorting through the paperwork.</p><br><p>"Oh, Silvana." Douglas noticed her as he glanced at his watch, "Right on time! Great start, this is what an Operator should be like!"</p><br><p>Slightly unsure, Silvana sat down in the chair, her knees folded together.</p><br><p>"Right, let's get straight to the point. Anyway, I've got it all sorted out." Douglas waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"What... What does that mean? I'd like a more affirmative answer..." Silvana gulped.</p><br><p>Douglas nodded with a short laugh.</p><br><p>"Anyway, the deal is as follows - in return for my favor, Ceska and Evor will do one difficult mission, more than usual. Evor doesn't like to overwork, but considering how much Ceska asked him to do it... he just couldn't say no."</p><br><p>With a slight wave of his hand, Douglas continued:</p><br><p>"You will pay your first year's tuition as initially intended. Then, you must always be in the top 3 of your group and excel in all exams. In that case, all other years of training will be free of charge."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide, shining brightly.</p><br><p>"Then, after four years of training and the final exam, you'll do your internship and after that, you'll go here at the Fort Norton and work in my department as a full-time Operator. When you gain experience, you'll get into the free Operators."</p><br><p>Bafflement was visible on Silvana's face.</p><br><br><p>Douglas nodded deeply and leaned forward.</p><br><p>"Yes. That means you can be chosen by some Phantom, perhaps someone strong, talented, and... special. The one with whom you Silvana Desio, will become partners, perhaps for life."</p><br><p>Silvana gasped, she knew that someday she would have her own Phantom since she was going to be an Operator, but hearing it from another person was different.</p><br><p>"What do you say? Do you agree?" Douglas's eyes narrowed, "I don't accept failure, but I can understand rejection."</p><br><p>All Douglas saw was Silvana's calm, already fully grown-up gaze.</p><br><p>"There will be no rejection - just a direct route to Operator work."</p>
