            <br><p>Each Phantom had a different set of abilities with a varying purpose. The abilities had something unique, such as Adam's silver threads.</p><br><p>His ability had many flaws, but the capability to pierce through even the toughest armor could not be overrated. It was what helped him win and survive many battles.</p><br><p>Adam's needle or claws could hardly protect him, also he could not use his ability for mass attacks and also had serious limitations. Everything had its pros and cons.</p><br><p>However, Adam never doubted the piercing power of his needle and silver threads. It could be said that this was his main trump card.</p><br><br><p>So... the cascade of sparks flying off to the sides made his eyes go wide and his heart beat much faster in terror.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Nessa's hands slowly clenched, shattering the silver threads one by one. Swirl should have torn her hands apart, as it had done to all opponents before.</p><br><p>Despite this, Nessa's hands were able to withstand this damage. New scratches kept appearing on her palms, and tiny pieces flew off her claws, but it wasn't enough to do her really serious damage.</p><br><p>"What? Something wrong? Didn't expect to find someone to block your attack? You're too arrogant and you don't have a decent reason for it!" Nessa exclaimed furiously, clenching her palms together.</p><br><p>Adam's huge silver swirl, became smaller several times under Nessa's pressure before completely disappearing between Nessa's hands.</p><br><p>All that remained of Adam's powerful attack was a few silver threads flying before his eyes.</p><br><p>'Seriously? What the fuck just happened?' Adam couldn't believe what he was seeing. Before this, there wasn't a single opponent who could destroy his Silver Swirl, it should be impossible for creatures of his level.</p><br><p>"Stop looking at me like you've seen a ghost." Nessa snorted, "I warned you. Now, I'm stronger."</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Nessa's palm thrust into Adam's stomach. It wasn't a fist punch, her sharp claws, pierced his flesh like a deadly spear.</p><br><br><p>Adam spat out a mouthful of blood that hit Nessa's face once more.</p><br><p>Nessa could have continued to attack, she only needed to deliver another similar strike to Adam's throat, but... she didn't.</p><br><p>The reason wasn't that Nessa wanted to spare him, no, it was just once Adam's blood was in front of her lips, all her attention shifted to the so delicious crimson droplets.</p><br><br><p>Nessa, kicked Adam aside with her foot, as if afraid he would take away her opportunity to savor this treat. At that moment, Nessa was acting like a naughty child.</p><br><p>Then, Nessa opened her mouth wide and devoured every drop.</p><br><p>It didn't have the same effect as before, but her eyes flashed and she felt a slight surge of energy. It was hard to compare it to anything else since Nessa was the only one who had gone through something like this.</p><br><p>"Hmm... How strange... My body moved on its own..." Nessa muttered in confusion.</p><br><p>Then, she turned around, looking at Adam who hadn't yet gotten out of the debris, being deep in the wall.</p><br><p>'Anyway, we need to get this over with soon. I feel like I'm starting to get tired. After all, this transformation can't go on indefinitely.' Nessa slowly stepped forward, maintaining her seriousness.</p><br><p>Streams of blood dripped from her palms, letting scarlet drops fall to the ground. Though her hands were able to destroy Adam's Silver Swirl, she had taken damage. Hundreds of scratches and dozens of cuts covered her palms.</p><br><br><p>Nessa moved toward Adam, while two bloody trails remained behind her.</p><br><p>If Silvana was worried about Adam, because no one had ever beaten him so easily, Magnus watched Nessa with genuine interest.</p><br><p>'I see... Now, after that move, I'm pretty sure it's all about Adam's blood.</p><br><p>But... the thing is, is it Phantom's blood, or is it his blood exactly? Nessa tried to hide it, but she's clearly the type to fall for the strong one.' Magnus pondered with a serious face.</p><br><p>Who would win this fight didn't interest him. What was really important to him was to figure out how to make Nessa go through such a transformation again - when the effect was gone.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Phantom blood... Maybe it can help others become hybrids like it did with Nessa?' Magnus thought, tapping a finger on his cheek, his gaze deep, 'It could work. Though... Somehow I doubt it. Would it be that easy, someone would have already created a hybrid before me.'</p><br><p>"Hey! You're not going to stop them?!" Silvana exclaimed with a great frown, realizing that Nessa could have done critical damage to Adam.</p><br><p>Magnus slowly shifted his gaze to her.</p><br><p>"No. Why? It might be good for Adam to lose. It's been pretty rare in his history, the last time was in Fall Hill Prison, right? Though... He was mentally overwhelmed when facing Thunder Demon the first time." Magnus shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"But!" Silvana exclaimed, only to see Magnus's angry face.</p><br><p>"Shut the fuck up." Magnus said menacingly, "Don't forget where you are. Just keep watching."</p><br><p>Silvana gulped. That was all she could reply.</p><br><br><p>"Hey, why don't you say something? If you ask me nicely to stop, I'll do it!" Nessa waved her hand.</p><br><p>The next thing Nessa saw was a bright silver flash that appeared behind the cloud of smoke.</p><br><p>Before she could react, Adam's silver claws, came down on her face. Nessa instinctively grabbed his arm trying to loosen Adam's grip, but...</p><br><p>'What...? Why can't I get...?' Nessa was baffled, 'Has he gotten stronger? How?!'</p><br><p>Then, Nessa looked at Adam's face and her eyes went wide.</p><br><p>She seemed to see a reflection of her transformation, but it was worth remembering that she was the copy here, not the original. Her transformation was a copy of every Phantom's stealthy trump card - Resonance.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Nessa's heart began to beat faster, gazing in awe at Adam's swollen veins, showing that he was at the peak of his powers.</p><br><p>"You've definitely reached the Top-3 level among Purple Threat level monsters, but... this is your maximum." Adam arrogantly said with a cold gaze before tossing Nessa aside like a projectile.</p><br><p>Nessa instinctively did a somersault, carefully touching the wall with her feet rather than crashing into it. She didn't take any damage.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, a bolt of lightning flashed towards her as five sharp silver claws sank into her stomach.</p><br><p>"ARGH!!!" Nessa spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><br><p>Her eyes reflected electric shocks as Adam grabbed her by the hair and threw her to the ground. Due to the force of the throw, Nessa bounced slightly off the ground with her face twisted in pain.</p><br><p>Then, artlessly and roughly, Adam began, over and over, smashing Nessa's head into the wall, each time shaking it.</p><br><p>Nessa tried to fight back with her hands against the wall, but Adam was simply stronger.</p><br><br><p>Her muscles and instincts were formidable weapons, but what was the point of a sharp sword if it could be broken in a few powerful attacks?</p><br><p>After ten or even fifteen shakes, Adam finally stopped, loosening his grip and releasing Nessa's hair.</p><br><p>With empty eyes, Nessa fell to the ground, only the slight rumble of debris breaking beneath her could be heard.</p>
