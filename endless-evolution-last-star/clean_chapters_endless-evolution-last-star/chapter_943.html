            <br><p>Silvana was where she belonged - in a safe room in front of several screens and communication with her Phantom. The only thing different from Adam's journey at the Fortress of the Lone Serpent was the way through which they talked.</p><br><p>Silvana could address the cameras on Adam's NEP if she wished, though she preferred to use the shared sight, but her voice now came directly into Adam's head.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Adam, I think you need to help her. It is up to you to find and kill the S4 monster. If Risha loses and is taken back upstairs, you'll have to wander into unknown territory alone.'</p><br><p>Adam leaned on his arm, looking at Risha and the lizard with a bored look. 'She can win. She doesn't need to try to kill such a durable opponent with a single attack. Instead, if I were her, I would focus on gradually weakening a lizard. A few cuts, blood loss, and victory won't be long in coming.'</p><br><p>"By the way..." Adam muttered with a sly smile. 'Pass my words on to Risha. I'm sure you can tap into her channel.</p><br><p>With a short delay, Silvana nodded.</p><br><br><p>She didn't understand why Adam couldn't say it to Risha himself; they were a few meters apart.</p><br><p>Then, Risha put her hands up, clutching her axe tightly. She received a message from Glen, which was clear from the way her eyes darted to Adam, but she wasn't going to listen to it.</p><br><p>In crimson streams, like dark blood energy traveled towards the axe, sinking into the wide double blade.</p><br><p>"Tsk, I don't need your help, much less your stupid advice!" Risha snorted, her hands shaking.</p><br><p>"I'm strong enough to kill some S3 monster! It's past me!"</p><br><p>With unwavering determination, she brought the axe down to the ground. Cracks ran from the blade, the crimson energy moving towards the lizard in a single burst.</p><br><p>The energy destroyed everything in its path, going to shatter every scale, break every bone in the lizard's body.</p><br><p>Then... the Prime Obsidian Lizard's eyes glowed brightly as red electrical discharges ran across its stripes.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the lizard disappeared beneath the surface, evading the wide attack.</p><br><p>Risha's face went pale watching as arrays of her energy went into destroying the rocks instead of the S3 monster.</p><br><p>"What...?" she stammered, her voice shaking. "Where did it disappear to?"</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a tall shadow erupted from the ground, a glint running down its sharp claws.</p><br><p>Risha stepped back, she wanted to counterattack, but the distance was too close.</p><br><p>'Shit... Did I screw up again?'</p><br><p>The prime lizard's predatory gaze reflected in her eyes.</p><br><p>'Before I can swing my axe, its claws will rip me to shreds.'</p><br><p>Then... For some reason, the lizard stopped as its eyes went wide in genuine shock. Something grabbed the lizard's tail, pulling the monster back.</p><br><p>In a desperate swing, curved claws swept in front of Risha's face as the tall figure threw the lizard away.</p><br><p>Blinking once, Risha discerned Adam, who stood nonchalantly in front of her. There was no disappointment in his eyes, no pride, no desire to taunt her.</p><br><p>He only shook his head disapprovingly. "Seriously? I realize you lost to me, but there's no shame in that."</p><br><p>"However... to be put in mortal danger by a large lizard?" Adam raised an eyebrow, pointing at the prime lizard. "That's not cool at all."</p><br><p>Despite their conversation, the Prime Obsidian Lizard had no intention of attacking. The monster realized that if Adam joined the fight, it would change a lot of things. But, the lizard didn't abandon its plans to kill Risha, for that it needed another attack.</p><br><p>Clenching her fists tightly, Risha gritted her teeth. "Shut up! I'm not going to listen to you or use your stupid advice! I like to defeat my opponents with one strong attack! That's what I've always done!</p><br><p>"My weapon is a huge fucking axe, not short fast blades to defeat through the exhaustion of my opponent!"</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Adam didn't argue, instead, he nodded deeply in agreement with Risha.</p><br><p>Then, she raised her fist, as his eyes grew darker.</p><br><p>"In that case, you should do it like this-"</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam's figure shuddered as he appeared beside the lizard.</p><br><p>Energy traveled along his arm, his muscles tensed and purple streams moved across his wrist, enveloping his fist like a deadly weapon.</p><br><p>Before the Prime Obsidian Lizard could realize anything, Adam's fist came crashing down on the monster from above.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The stone layer and scales flew off one by one, while wind rings fled from the shockwave.</p><br><p>A shudder ran through the ground reaching Risha's trembling legs, all under Adam's ice-cold eyes.</p><br><p>The impact weighing several tons crushed the great lizard into a flat, bloody mess of bone and flesh.</p><br><p>All that was left was the pop from the blasted body, spreading to the far reaches of the caverns.</p><br><p>With a shake of his hand, Adam brushed off the drops of blood and stepped forward, stopping at a random lava lake.</p><br><p>Risha stared at him, shocked. She was speechless, unable to utter even a single word.</p><br><p>"Your last attempt was decent. You probably could kill the lizard in one strike like you wanted, but you just didn't have enough firepower."</p><br><p>Then, Adam slowly turned looking at her with slight disdain.</p><br><p>"During our battle, you were saved by your brother. Now I had to do it," his low voice rang out.</p><br><br><p>Soon, he stopped in front of Risha, like a shadow looking down at her, only his blue eyes shining.</p><br><p>"But... I am not your brother. I'm sure Orel is watching us even now and at any moment ready to send his men to your aid or come down here himself. I would do the same for my little sister.</p><br><p>"However... He's not here and I don't intend to waste any more of my time on you."</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam pointed off into the distance where silhouettes merged with bursts of flame.</p><br><p>"Now we are going on the hunt for the S4 monster. That's our only goal and you're going to help me with that."</p><br><p>Risha frowned mockingly.</p><br><p>"Hah... Why on earth would I help you...? You're not my ally-"</p><br><br><p>Adam's fist plunged into her stomach.</p><br><br><p>"Because I saved you. At the Lower Ring, that's worth a lot. Just like the rest of the Citadel, isn't it?'</p>
