            <br><br><p>The night was always been both the most peaceful and dangerous time of day.</p><br><p>For one person, it was the epitome of silence, most people were asleep or resting, and there was no noise and no city bustle. It was the perfect time to achieve peace and immerse oneself in thoughts.</p><br><p>For another, the same person, a certain night could become a nightmare. The less safe the place was, the more dangerous it was to go out in the city.</p><br><p>The ninth wing seemed to be a prime example of this rule. After all, this was a city where laws didn't work, where everyone followed certain rules amidst the constant struggle for influence between organizations and corporations.</p><br><p>But... when you've always lived in chaos, there's nothing else to do but consider it normal.</p><br><p>The black car slowly pulled into the nearest neighborhood from the main gate. Adam, Gladius, and the others were moving forward at a slow speed for some time now.</p><br><p>Adam expected to see destroyed buildings and dirty streets, at least that was what his mind imagined due to his years of experience living in slums.</p><br><p>'Oh... This is not at all what I anticipated.' Adam thought inwardly as he looked at the many buildings, most of which still had lights burning brightly even though it was quite late.</p><br><p>Whether it was an ordinary house, a warehouse, or a skyscraper, each building had a unique design, sometimes overly eccentric and not very successful, and sometimes it was more like a work of art.</p><br><p>That was hardly possible in any other part of the Citadel, because in the ninth wing, the owners of those buildings also owned the area, to the fullest extent.</p><br><p>If an organization owned a restaurant or a bank, they could do whatever they wanted with that building and on that land. There were no laws, bureaucracy, or government officials who could prohibit a building from being built in one way or another.</p><br><p>It was also a good way to show who owned what land.</p><br><p>Thus, in the ninth wing, the following scene was nothing more than a routine: A girl and a guy walked out of the restaurant with bright smiles on their faces, followed a few seconds later by an elderly couple, as happy with their evening as the young ones.</p><br><p>Opposite them, just across the street, several muscular men covered in tattoos were beating each other's faces with their bloody fists.</p><br><p>It was not a friendly fight, as they cursed each other from time to time and their faces were full of anger.</p><br><p>If something like this happened in any other wing, the young boy and girl along with the elderly couple would be scared and run away as quickly as possible.</p><br><p>But, they didn't even pay attention to it as they went about their business.</p><br><p>"Damn... This is strange. Why don't they have any reaction at all?" Adam was puzzled, his gaze running from side to side.</p><br><br><p>"Because they know that as long as they're in that territory they're safe, and what's more, they're just ordinary people, not mercenaries or bandits, and certainly not Phantoms."</p><br><p>Gladius nonchalantly waved a hand before speeding off.</p><br><p>"No one would support them if they attacked regular humans. There's no point or profit in it, which means such a display of aggression can only be explained by bloodlust."</p><br><p>Then, he smirked, his gaze shifting to the map for a moment.</p><br><p>"It's not forbidden, but if you have bloodlust, the rules say you have to find an opponent and let it out."</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head.</p><br><p>"They're going to fight right outside?"</p><br><p>Gladius shook his head with a bitter smile.</p><br><p>"Nah, most conflicts that can't be solved with words or money are solved very simply and effectively - with combat where only pure power matters."</p><br><p>Gladius swept his hand around.</p><br><p>"There are a huge number of different arenas in the ninth ring, both for commoners and Phantoms. Here you can find arenas of every type, size, and shape and of course - the Moon Colosseum is one of the most important arenas of this wonderful place."</p><br><br><p>Then, without further ado, Gladius accelerated to the limit.</p><br><p>It was already late at night, but there were still quite a few cars on the roads in the city center, all waiting their turn to avoid an accident, but not Gladius.</p><br><p>He drove at full speed, not looking at the color of the traffic lights or the other cars.</p><br><p>His actions could easily create chaos, especially if he made a mistake, but considering that it was a Gladius, his instincts alone were more than enough to drive at the level of a professional racer.</p><br><p>Adam, Silvana, and the others didn't have time to say anything as they climbed up the hill to one curious-looking building.</p><br><p>A tall, skinny hand stretched upward, made of steel and covered with many thick chains, numerous massive windows were visible here and there, showing that it was a real building and not a statue.</p><br><p>The fingers of the hand were bent, holding a huge eye with crimson pupils looking in four directions like a beacon. The eye was entirely made up of steel beams and wide glass panels of different colors.</p><br><p>"Holy shit..." Silvana muttered with her eyes wide open.</p><br><p>She turned back around, gazing at a few bloody signs that they encountered on the approach to the hill. It was tall pillars, severed hands clinging to them.</p><br><p>Sure, the hands weren't real, it was simple decoration, but... it was right in the city and anyone could see it just by walking on the roads.</p><br><br><p>Gladius opened the door, stepping outside after the long time that their trip took.</p><br><p>"Agh... It's so nice to get some fresh air again!" Gladius said with a happy smile on his face, taking deep breaths.</p><br><p>Rosalind stood not far from him, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Your window was completely open the whole time. What fresh air are you talking about?" Rosalind raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"Hahaha! You got me." Gladius chuckled insidiously.</p><br><p>Slowly, everyone got out of the car, directing their gazes towards the interesting, awe-inspiring building.</p><br><p>"Welcome to Crimson Eye. To one of the main residences of the Noukx Family!"</p><br><p>Then, Gladius stepped forward confidently.</p><br><p>Experience new stories on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Koben Noukx is already waiting for us." Gladius's said in a predatory voice.</p>
