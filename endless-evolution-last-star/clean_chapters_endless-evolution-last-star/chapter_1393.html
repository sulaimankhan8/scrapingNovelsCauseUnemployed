            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1393: Chief Guard</strong></p><br><p>Adam understood that he was heading into the monster city, but that wasn’t enough to prepare him for everything that awaited him there.</p><br><p>One monster hunting another? Guards helping hunters with their prey?</p><br><p>It immediately reminded Adam of how the Citadel was organized. Phantoms took assignments from the mission departments, went to the Dead Lands, did their work, and returned.</p><br><p>‘It seems like Izardo is organized in much the same way, right?’ Adam thought as he walked along the edge of one of the four main roads.</p><br><p>He didn’t try to bypass the guards or the gates because he didn’t want any trouble. He understood that there were monsters in Izardo that were strong enough that he would be powerless against them in a fight.</p><br><p>‘Although… It’s not surprising.’ He looked at the city ahead. ‘When so many people gather in one place, trade is born. That means there is demand, which must be met by supply. Hah, maybe I should take on a few missions and remember what it’s like?’</p><br><p>Ironically, the stronger Phantom became, the more independent he became from the Citadel.</p><br><p>In the beginning, when he was a K0-K1 Phantom, he had to take missions from time to time to earn money to live on. Then, as Phantom grew stronger and the missions became more difficult, the rewards increased exponentially.</p><br><p>By the late stages of the K2-Level, Adam had enough money to afford a luxurious life and not worry about anything for the next few years.</p><br><p>But at the K3-Level, money was no longer an issue. Any Phantom with such power could afford to do a few missions a year and have more money than most ordinary people.</p><br><p>Sure, at this stage, money ceased to have the same significance as before and was replaced by power.</p><br><p>The desire to reach new heights forced the Phantoms to stray further and further from the Citadel and Bastions. Even distant spires with teleports were unable to help when the Phantoms ventured into the depths of the Dark Shore or Tarnished Lands.</p><br><p>Thus, Adam found himself here, on his way to Izardo, and the nearest spire that could send him to the Citadel via teleport was a considerable distance away. He would have to cross several territories and even leave one region for another to return home.</p><br><p>Perhaps this is what influenced Adam’s decision to go deeper. He needed the Dark Heart, and he had a chance to find it at Izardo.</p><br><br><p>After a few steps, Adam stopped as the great gates loomed above him.</p><br><p>“Halt!” The chief guard exclaimed as he approached Adam.</p><br><p>He was a tall man with dark blue skin and two black horns on his head. His aura was far from Norax’s or even Narica’s, but he was clearly a powerful monster.</p><br><p>“Is this your first time in Izardo?” The chief guard raised an eyebrow suspiciously. “Which faction are you from? Are you alone? Hmm…” He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “I don’t remember seeing anyone like you before.”</p><br><p>In response, Adam awkwardly scratched the back of his head.</p><br><p>“Hah, you see… I’m not a monster.”</p><br><br><p>Adam released a tiny part of his aura that reached the chief guard and immediately disappeared. The guards standing just a few meters behind felt nothing.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the chief guard’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br><p>“Damn, you’re actually a Phantom. You’re quite rare guests, you know?”</p><br><p>Adam just shrugged silently.</p><br><p>“I see. Nevertheless, I still need to know the reason you want to visit Izardo. I think you understand.”</p><br><p>“Sure. The Raven Beak, I want to visit this place and meet with its owner to discuss a possible job together.”</p><br><p>The chief guard’s eyes filled with understanding.</p><br><p>“Oh, Ms. Helasa? Hah, I don’t know who gave you that idea, but you’ll have a hard time agreeing on anything with her. She has a hard time getting along with monsters, let alone…” He glared at Adam. “Well, I think you get the picture.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam looked at the gate and tilted his head.</p><br><p>“So… Does that mean I can go in?”</p><br><p>The chief guard grinned. “Of course. It doesn’t matter if you’re a monster or a Phantom, the gates of Izardo are open to you as long as you don’t cause any trouble. And, to be honest with you, the Phantoms are welcome guests. As I said, there are very few of you, you know?”</p><br><p>Adam was filled with mixed feelings. The chief guard, a fearsome monster, turned out to be much friendlier and more responsive than Adam could have imagined.</p><br><p>“Here, come in, I hope you like it here.” The chief guard stepped aside as he gestured to the other guards, who immediately opened the gates.</p><br><p>“T-Thanks,” Adam nodded slightly and headed forward.</p><br><p>Sure, the guards looked curiously at the new Phantom, but it didn’t go beyond glances.</p><br><p>Soon, Adam found himself in the middle of the city, at the beginning of the streets, as he immediately remembered the many maps through which Norax had tried to teach Adam to navigate Izardo.</p><br><p>“Fuck me…” Adam muttered, looking at the winding streets of the city, the many people walking from all directions, and the several levels of height that made the layout of buildings and neighborhoods several times more complicated.</p><br><p>Unlike the Citadel, where even without a map it was fairly easy to find your way around because everything was built evenly and designed for easy access, Izardo was more like a natural, ever-evolving chaos.</p><br><p>If they had been somewhere else, Silvana would have appeared next to Adam and enjoyed the view herself, but this time she didn’t want to take any chances.</p><br><p>“Don’t worry. I’ve kept all the maps, and I remember the way. Just follow my words, and I think we’ll get to the Raven Beak soon.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded and took a big step forward.</p><br><br><p>Immediately, someone bumped into him with their shoulder.</p><br><p>The man with the large bag on his back turned around, a frown on his face.</p><br><p>“Hey! Stop standing there daydreaming! Either move along or get out of the way!” He grumbled and walked on.</p><br><p>Before Adam could react, he had to take a few steps to the side so that other passersby wouldn’t bump into him.</p><br><p>This was not at all like what he was used to in the Citadel, and…</p><br>
