            <br><p>Silvana was still reeling from the shock, she was holding her shoulders tightly, trying to realize what happened. Adam, for his part, was more concerned about the unknown girl who burst into the room.</p><br><p>It was as if she were born out of ice, everything from her white hair to her pale skin pointed to that, her blue eyes were not as rich a color as Adam's, clear and piercing like blades.</p><br><br><p>Keeping his tone calm, Adam stepped forward, setting himself in front of Silvana. He didn't consider the girl an enemy, but she didn't look like an ally. Her overwhelming aura frightened him.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the girl didn't ignore and answered:</p><br><p>"My name is Seyrina, I am a K4-Phantom. Today it was my turn to watch over the fort and all its surrounding buildings. It's a volunteer job I signed up for because of cases like yours."</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana exchanged a glance. Then, they looked around the room. There was almost nothing left of the white walls, black stains, and the smell of burning, unpleasant and acrid, filled the space.</p><br><p>"K4-Phantom...?" he muttered, in a daze.</p><br><p>As everyone knew, this was the highest level, except for the exceptionally strong Second Rank Phantoms such as Damien.</p><br><p>Adam only knew one K4-Phantom: Dahla, but he had not seen her in battle. She was helping him because of her sympathy for Tron.</p><br><p>"Yes." Seyrina nodded, her gaze still stern, "So it's in your best interest not to cross me and to listen properly."</p><br><p>Then, she stared at Silvana, who was slowly coming to her senses.</p><br><p>"After all, you don't seem to have much time. I'm sure a few more days and her power will tear her apart, she'll turn into a handful of ashes."</p><br><p>Her words sounded like a threat, but neither Adam nor Silvana sensed evil intentions from Seyrina. She had informed them of a fact because if they did not act, it would actually happen.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Silvana's face turned pale, her teeth chattering with fear of possible death, cruel and from her own powers!</p><br><p>Adam remained calm, Seyrina did not give them a death sentence, it was a warning on her part.</p><br><p>"I see... Why is this happening? What are we supposed to do to make sure Silvana isn't in danger anymore?"</p><br><p>After a few moments Seyrina nodded deeply, she turned around heading for the exit.</p><br><p>"For starters, you need to calm down. There is a solution, after all, you are not the first to be in this situation, though..."</p><br><p>Seyrina's eyes studied Adam intently, head to toe.</p><br><p>"It's very rare for it to happen this early..." she waved her hand, "I'll find you some clothes and summon you to the fort. There are plenty of places there where we can talk in silence."</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly as Seyrina left.</p><br><br><p>Just as she had said, it wasn't long before one of the orderlies brought a new set of clothes for Silvana, they were in another spare room.</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Silvana and took a step towards the exit.</p><br><p>"I'll wait outside. I don't know what's going on, but I hope Seyrina actually knows how to help us."</p><br><br><p>The door closed as Adam leaned against the wall, his arms crossed over his chest. Deep inside he was surprised at how easily he accepted Seyrina's words about Silvana's possibility of death, as if he didn't believe it was even a hundredth of a percent possible.</p><br><p>Left in silence, Silvana took a deep breath. Fifteen minutes had already passed since the fire, in that time she had already pondered the event dozens of times.</p><br><p>"Agh... I should stop panicking. It must be something to do with Adam's increased strength..."</p><br><p>After sorting out her thoughts, Silvana nodded deeply and threw off Adam's tattered coat.</p><br><p>A slight smile formed on her face, feeling the warmth in her chest from his care.</p><br><p>"Hah, good thing he reacted quickly and covered me with his coat, or the medics would see me naked. Damn, all my clothes were burned, that would have been embarrassing as hell, good thing no one saw it."</p><br><p>Then, picking up a new set of clothes, Silvana froze, as if she was petrified. In that moment she realized that if Adam covered her with his coat, then he saw her naked, in detail, because they were practically pressed against each other.</p><br><p>If Silvana's face had been red with embarrassment before, now hot steam was ready to rush from her ears. Never in her life had she been so embarrassed as she tucked herself into her clothes, hiding her face from the world.</p><br><p>"No..." she muttered in a hoarse voice, while her heart was beating like crazy, "Why did he see me that way...? That's... That's not good at all."</p><br><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p><br><p>Someone knocked on the door, bringing Silvana out of her thoughts.</p><br><p>Adam's voice sounded:</p><br><p>"Hey, are you coming soon? It's been five minutes. Is something wrong? Should I come in?"</p><br><p>Silvana turned sharply, trying to stop herself, afraid he would do it.</p><br><p>"No. I'll be right in... I just need some time!"</p><br><br><p>With a deep sigh, Silvana shook her head and did what she had to do. They had an important conversation ahead of them, they had to find out what happened and the reason Silvana almost burned down the hospital.</p><br><p>After all, even though everything went well, it wasn't just her who could get hurt, but the other patients as well. If that had happened, Silvana would have been blaming herself for a long time.</p><br><br><br><p>With a slight movement, the door opened as Silvana finally stepped out of the room. Adam glanced at her.</p><br><p>For some reason, Silvana immediately looked away, embarrassed.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion but didn't ask too many questions, since Seyrina was waiting for them at the fort.</p><br><p>"Come, Seyrina has contacted me."</p><br><p>Without further ado, Adam turned around, heading along the passageway.</p><br><br><p>No sooner did he take a few steps than Silvana grabbed his wrist as if unwilling to let go.</p><br><br><p>Still afraid to look at him, Silvana put her palm to her chest, muttering:</p><br><p>"Thank you... While I was panicking you quickly understood what had to be done. It may not have been visible because of the way I was screaming, but... it helped me a lot. It would have been a lot worse without you..."</p><br><p>Suddenly, instead of answering, Adam tugged Silvana's arm.</p><br><p>Before she could realize anything, Adam's hand was on her shoulder, pulling her against him.</p><br><p>"Sure, it couldn't be any other way. Now, we'll find out together what happened and solve this problem. Then... I'll sleep and buy you some fruits, I owe you, you know."</p>
