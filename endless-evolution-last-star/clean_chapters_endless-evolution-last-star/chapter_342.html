            <br><p>’Wait... What’s going on with Adam?’ Silvana inwardly muttered looking at him.
</p><br><p>She had often seen him use his Second Order. It was a tall gauntlet like a monster’s paw woven from hundreds of silver threads with five sharp claws.
</p><br><p>The Second Order always covered Adam’s left hand, while his First Order, a silver needle, always occupied his right hand. Furthermore, when he used the needle or the claws, only one ability was active. It always worked that way, with no exceptions.
</p><br><p>However... As soon as Adam used his Second Order, his Evolution Tree actively trembled. Every time Phantom’s Evolution Tree trembled, it showed that his power was about to grow.
</p><br><p>This was not related to Phantom’s level. No matter how many times the Evolution Tree shook, its power could not grow strong enough to move Adam from K1-Level to K2-Level, it needed the Key, there was no other way.
</p><br><p>However, Adam’s strength could rise to a certain level if the right conditions were met.
</p><br><p>Right now, he was in Fallen Crypt, Yellow Threat Area, and was near the Fume Cathedral, where the energy density was slightly lower than in the rest of the Fallen Crypt.
</p><br><p>But... Plague Reaper was completely to blame for what was happening now. Because of his actions, there was too much energy in Fume Cathedral.
</p><br><p>White particles of energy covered everything around, it was the fused energy of the Fume Throne, which Plague Reaper got rid of because he didn’t need it.
</p><br><p>He occupied the Fume Throne to subdue Fume Armors and get rid of unwanted spectators, monsters, and to show his greatness.
</p><br><p>Thus, in Fume Cathedral, the energy level reached Mid of even Dark Yellow Level.
</p><br><p>Sure, unlike monsters, Phantoms couldn’t absorb some massive energy source like a larva king to trigger the evolution process. They had other ways to become stronger and restraining mechanisms such as the Keys and the conditions to create them.
</p><br><p>However, Evolution Tree was almost entirely composed of dense energy that was under the Phantom’s complete control.
</p><br><p>In critical situations, the Phantom’s body would let some energy inside, which would cause Evolution Tree to grow to meet the Phantom’s needs.
</p><br><p>For this reason, engaging in deadly battles and winning was a sure way to quickly become stronger for both Phantoms and monsters. But, this could only happen once in a long period and had its limits.
</p><br><p>However, it was enough for one K1-Phantom to be much stronger than another K1-Phantom, because the number of deadly battles they went through were different. Discover stories with NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>Also, some scientists who closely studied monsters believed that the trembling of the Evolution Trees had caused their world to appear as Crown Monsters.
</p><br><p>Crown Types were originally no different from ordinary monsters, and Crown Types did not exist at all. They were simple monsters, but because they fought constantly and their Evolution Trees trembled time after time after their victories in deadly battles, they became completely new, unrecognizable creatures.
</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that the tremble of the Evolution Tree was an emergency and dangerous measure to help Phantom or Monster deal with a crisis.
</p><br><p>The most accurate comparison would be the release of adrenaline into the bloodstream of a normal person in critical situations, only instead of adrenaline here, it was energy that was absorbed by the Evolution Tree and it became a bit bigger.
</p><br><p>This was a great strain on both the Phantom’s body and the monster’s body, for the body had to be strong and sturdy enough to withstand the power and size of the Evolution Tree.
</p><br><p>At this point, the Phantoms and monsters were aided a bit by the natural process of wound healing, comparable to the way muscles in normal people grow after serious physical activity.
</p><br><p>Sure, there was a limit determined by the level of the creature, but it helped the body of the Phantom or monster to become a little tougher after mortal combat, which helped to withstand the growth of the Evolution Tree that happened in critical moments.
</p><br><p>If these two mechanisms were not linked, then instead of becoming a little stronger in the heat of battle, the Phantom or monster’s body would simply be torn apart by their own Evolution Trees.
</p><br><p>And... The emotional component was also important. Evolution Tree wouldn’t act on its own if it didn’t have the Phantom’s will. The energy and the critical situation were just conditions that needed a catalyst to start acting. The catalyst was the Phantom’s desire.
</p><br><p>It could be a desire to survive, a desire to protect someone, a desire to escape, a desire to win, or... a desire for revenge.
</p><br><p>It was the latter that was filling Adam’s mind right now, causing his Evolution Tree to tremble and grow a little. The muscles in his body tensed up hard like steel ropes, allowing energy to spill throughout his body.
</p><br><p>At the same time, when Adam used his Second Order, his needle began to separate into hundreds of threads about to disappear, but...
</p><br><p>As his Evolution Tree shuddered once more, one last time, the threads returned to their place, binding tightly around his right arm, making the tip of the needle a little longer and most importantly sharper.
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes shone brightly, reflecting the silhouette of his Evolution Tree for a moment before a single trickle of blood came from his right eye.
</p><br><p>Osana cast a slightly concerned look at him. She hadn’t expected that Adam’s desire for revenge and tearing Plague Reaper apart would lead to the tremble of the Evolution Tree.
</p><br><p>’Shit... His body is at its limit. If he gets any stronger, he just can’t take it, and considering it’s him, he clearly won’t care about his condition. He’ll die trying to win, that’s for sure.’ Osana muttered inwardly as she looked at Adam’s majestic figure.
</p><br><p>Then, she bit her lip and smirked slyly.
</p><br><p>’However, if we really are on death’s doorstep, I can take care of you. But...’ Osana glanced at Katrin, Oskar and Erla, ’Just you.’
</p><br><p>Plague Reaper frowned heavily, glaring at Adam, whose gaze was deep and intense. He was about to unleash all his power and anger upon Plague Reaper, and his threads would be a faithful guide to his will.</p>
