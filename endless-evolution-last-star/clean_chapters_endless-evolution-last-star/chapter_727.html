            <br><p>"Agh...? What are you talking about? I don't have a hell of a lot of time!"</p><br><p>Vines was fast, but Lona Blaze timed it right, everything was within the bounds of possibility.</p><br><p>[I am not authorized to activate the sun seal, according to the terms of the Pact, only you can do that. I can only advise and guide you by following the terms of the Pact.]</p><br><p>The correct decision for Adam right now was to bounce to the side, dodge the attacking vines, then figure out what Lone Blaze wanted to do.</p><br><p>But, he had an opportunity to change the situation right now, so he couldn't help but take it.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam channeled energy towards the sun seal scorched on his chest through the hellish pain, causing the sun to flare brightly with amber flames.</p><br><p>"Alright, let's see what you can do, the External Artifact."</p><br><p>At the same moment, a change began to take place within Adam's inner space. Time passed differently in the real world and inner space, but right now, Adam wasn't here. He didn't know what was happening inside, and it was quite interesting.</p><br><p>One of the three crystals around the sun seal shone brightly as a blob of flame appeared in Adam's inner space.</p><br><p>[Well, well... You've already moved into action... Haven't you?]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree watched the fire floating amongst the darkness with mild curiosity, not preventing it from moving freely in space.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze only shuddered slightly, its ghostly copy was in Adam's inner space.</p><br><p>[Sure, this is new to him, as it is to me. Working with a human... I wouldn't do it unless it were an emergency...]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree grunted pleasantly, for it and Adam it was a good development, overall.</p><br><p>Slowly, the amber flames headed straight towards the Evolution Tree, but the blaze had no intention of attacking the Evolution Tree or joining it. In fact, the fire did not approach the Evolution Tree, but Adam's Initial Gene.</p><br><p>A long needle in a crystal sphere, the center of the Evolution Tree shuddered slightly with curiosity and anticipation.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze muttered:</p><br><p>[My power is limited for use, but... the limit on time and on my abilities is far greater than what this arrogant young man imagines...]</p><br><br><p>The fire headed towards the Initial Gene, forming the sign of a massive, blazing sun in front of the needle. The light from the sun fell on the silver needle in several rays but did not touch it. One of the rays passed into a flaming line that traveled from the Initial Gene, high up to one of the two special branches of the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>The purpose of the sun seal was not to change Adam's abilities or his origin, but to make him stronger, to allow him to use Lone Blaze powers, as the terms of the pact required.</p><br><p>At the same moment, one of the three crystals on the sun seal disappeared, leaving Adam with only two opportunities to use Lona Blaze's powers, but it worked much harder than a simple rune activation.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes shone brightly, yet the light was not white as usual, but amber as of a hot flame capable of burning everything in its path.</p><br><p>In an instant, red flames covered his needle, running along the edges like an active blaze, seething and violent.</p><br><p>There was too little time to think, the vines were already in front of him as everything happened faster than a split second for Adam.</p><br><br><p>Acting on instinct, Adam swung the needle high up.</p><br><p>The flames following the tip of the weapon created a wide fiery slash, bright and violent.</p><br><p>The vines did not abandon their movement trying to break through the wide line of fire, yet as soon as they got close to Adam, the flames burned them to ashes.</p><br><br><p>The remaining vines returned abruptly to the Sacrificial Holders, their carriers, under threat of death.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes slowly turned to the side, in a daze gazing at his needle. He had used quite a few attributes along the way, but fire had never been among them. The closest match was lightning, but those were two completely different forms of power.</p><br><br><p>His lips quivered in disbelief as he turned to Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>"A fire needle? And how many uses do I have of this force? How many more swings can I make? I can't figure it out..."</p><br><p>Several times Adam had gotten power from others, often it was from supports such as Osana or Katrin in the past. He was well aware that any enhancements had limitations, on time and on the number of uses or on how much damage the ability could absorb.</p><br><p>But, this time was different.</p><br><p>Find your next read on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>The External Artifact wasn't a simple ability or energy, it was something much more significant.</p><br><p>[The only limitation was the effect of our Pact...].</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, Lone Blaze's response seemed unrealistic to him.</p><br><p>"Wait, this can't be happening! Are you saying that my needle will now possess the fire attribute until the end of the Pact? But, what happens if I cancel the First Order?"</p><br><p>[Nothing... The first crystal acts on your First Order, my fire has temporarily become a part of it.]</p><br><br><p>For a while Adam didn't say anything, the Sacrificial Holders were in no hurry to attack, they were frightened by the unknown flames of their opponent.</p><br><br><p>After a few seconds, Adam came to some conclusions.</p><br><p>"So two more crystals on the sun seal..." his eyes traveled to his chest, one crystal hovering around the sun disappeared, "I'll be able to enhance two more of my abilities?"</p><br><p>[Not really... Adam, I'm getting tired of telling you this...]</p><br><br><p>[My power doesn't make your abilities stronger directly, it modifies them, keeping your origin, the base, but adding something new from my essence.]</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, he felt the heat from his chest heading towards his neck straight towards his head.</p><br><p>[Fine... I'll show you...].</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide when he felt the first pain enter his mind, the pain quickly intensifying.</p><br><p>"Wait! I can figure this out on my own! Last time was enough!"</p><br><p>But, Lone Blaze wasn't going to listen to him.</p><br><br><p>Adam fell to his knees as his eyes filled with a savage pain the same as when the sun seal was burned into his chest.</p><br><p>"AAAAAAAAAAAAARRHHH!!!"</p>
