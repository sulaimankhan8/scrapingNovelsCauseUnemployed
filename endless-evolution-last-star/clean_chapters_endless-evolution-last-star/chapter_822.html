            <br><p>As the mission at Fortress of the Lone Serpent ended, the Phantoms returned to their homes, which meant it was time for those on the side - the mission department - to work.</p><br><p>They had a lot of things to do, it turned out to be a sudden mission. It happened from time to time, but not because the Eclipse fell off schedule. Moreover, under the fortress was a previously uncharted territory and a monster that was not in the database.</p><br><p>Now, the workers had to investigate, estimate the monster's strength from the available materials, name it, and create its card. The same applied to all the other details of that mission.</p><br><p>However, although no one expected an unknown monster and such casualties among the Phantoms on a normal night, that was the technical part of the mission. No one else was in danger, the Phantoms could rest alone, or meet their loved ones, be it their family or Operators.</p><br><br><p>A young man with black hair and blue eyes slowly approached the massive building with white walls near one of the forts, his gaze tired but his gait confident.</p><br><p>The early morning was quiet, not much could happen, but the hospitals were working at full force, especially the military ones like this one. For the most part, the hospitals at the forts only held people associated with the Dead Lands, be it Phantoms, Operators, or the military.</p><br><p>Still, many rich people preferred to use these hospitals believing in their uniqueness and advanced technology, since the best of the best were sent to the Dead Lands first.</p><br><p>However, Operators were rare guests here, at least the low-level ones.</p><br><p>The first visitors and staff glanced at Adam's tattered coat, he wasn't home yet so he was wearing the same clothes at the battle in the serpent lands. Not a single piece was intact, if he was a bit unlucky there would be nothing left of his clothes but shreds.</p><br><p>People were baffled, but the workers quickly realized he was a Phantom, they didn't even need to look at his NEP for that. They'd been working here long enough to recognize a Phantom in a man at a single glance.</p><br><p>Soon, Adam approached the counter, meeting the girl's gaze.</p><br><p>She was nervous, it was obvious she had worked here recently.</p><br><p>"H-Hello... How can I help you?"</p><br><p>Adam tapped on the wooden board a few times.</p><br><p>"Silvana Desio, she's supposed to be undergoing treatment here. I want to know where she is."</p><br><p>His calm but firm voice made her wince. It seemed to her that if she didn't hurry she would be in trouble.</p><br><p>"S-Sure! I'll find out right away!"</p><br><p>After a few seconds, the girl looked up, answering with a wide smile:</p><br><p>"Silvana Desio, multiple fractures and lacerations on her left arm. She's undergoing one of the last procedures right now. If you want to visit her you should head to the left wing, 8th floor, room 22."</p><br><br><p>With a dry reply, Adam headed along the hallway.</p><br><p>His muddy shoe prints remained on the clean tiles, but no one dared to interrupt him. It wasn't even that he was a Phantom, they had to follow the rules as well, especially in a hospital.</p><br><p>His gaze was different, making the workers feel a strange fear deep inside.</p><br><p>After a few minutes, Adam stepped out of the elevator, looked at the room numbers, and quickly determined where he needed to go.</p><br><p>It wasn't long before he found himself in front of a door, opening it without difficulty.</p><br><p>Stepping inside, Adam found no one. The lone bed in the center was empty, with only the view of the industrial part of the city to keep him entertained.</p><br><p>Then, something caught his eye.</p><br><p>On the nightstand were fruit, a few oranges, two bananas, and one red apple.</p><br><p>Adam shrugged and sat on the corner of the bed, he had no choice but to wait.</p><br><p>Ten minutes later, with the sun illuminating the Citadel in full force, the door opened again.</p><br><p>Silvana in white hospital robes stopped in the doorway, looking at Adam like he was a ghost.</p><br><p>A few bandages still covered her left arm in particularly rough places, but there were only cuts that would soon heal under the ointment, 99% of her wounds were gone, though the treatment was hard even with all the technology in the hospital.</p><br><p>Surprise was reflected on Silvana's face. While Adam was well aware of what happened to her thanks to Alan, Silvana was unaware of the imminent arrival of her Phantom.</p><br><br><p>She closed the door carefully behind her, took a few steps forward, and glared unhappily at Adam, her hands at her sides while a stern gaze fell on him.</p><br><p>"Hey, what the hell are you doing?"</p><br><br><p>Adam took a big bite out of an apple, the crunch spread across the room, he ate half of it and all that was left of the two bananas was the peel thrown into the garbage bin.</p><br><p>"Hmm? What are you talking about?"</p><br><p>Then, he took another bite, causing Silvana to frown harder.</p><br><p>"Adam! That fruit brought me! I need to recover! They're not for you to come here and eat them!"</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Well, I was hungry, I can't help it."</p><br><p>Without hesitation, he brought the apple up to his mouth about to take the next bite, but stopped recalling her words.</p><br><p>Adam looked at Silvana and offered her the apple, turning the whole side.</p><br><br><p>"Argh! No, I don't want a half-eaten apple!"</p><br><p>Silvana rolled her eyes and collapsed on the bed next to him, her cheeks puffed up like a child's.</p><br><p>"There's no saving the apple, so finish every last bite."</p><br><p>"That's what I was going to do."</p><br><br><p>Silvana rolled her eyes, she was actually thinking about how she would come back from her long procedure and enjoy the fruit, but it wasn't meant to be.</p><br><p>With a slight smile on his face, Adam cast a glance at her left arm.</p><br><p>"Did you have a hard time? That was a nasty wound..."</p><br><p>Silvana flinched, she hadn't expected them to get to that topic so quickly. She stroked her shoulder, slightly embarrassed.</p><br><p>"Yeah... but I made it through. It's the least I could do for you."</p><br><p>Lowering his gaze, Adam smiled bitterly, losing his appetite.</p><br><p>"Thank you... You didn't just help me this time."</p><br><p>Adam stared straight into her eyes.</p><br>
