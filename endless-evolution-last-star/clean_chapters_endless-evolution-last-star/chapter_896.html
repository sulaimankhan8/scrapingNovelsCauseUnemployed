            <br><p>Immediately after Erik's words, Adam couldn't contain his curiosity and plunged into the inner space.</p><br><p>Reinz noticed this and hurriedly did the same.</p><br><br><p>In a slight rush, Adam ran up to the Crystal Gates, the first gate was open, while the second was slightly trembling wanting to tell Adam secrets about itself.</p><br><br><p>Adam touched the second gate when he heard a familiar mechanical voice.</p><br><p>[The second lesser gates will only open when the second orb absorbs three different energy sources...]</p><br><p>[The second orb needs to sense the full spectrum of energy...]</p><br><p>[You can do that at any time... only when you become capable of it...]</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow. Last time, the terms had been much more hazy. He didn't know what he had to do to gain the Stellar Resonance.</p><br><p>The new ability was his reward, not a condition.</p><br><p>"Hmm... The second orb requires me to have Full Energy Control. But... will I be able to do it all in one week?" Adam muttered, doubt filling his voice.</p><br><p>The last time he'd trained 100% to the Inner Energy Control, he'd trained with Tron at the Gray Castle.</p><br><p>Back then it had taken him much longer than one week and it was only one type out of three. Sure, he didn't know then that it was only a part of the Energy Control, but now he was going to do the same thing twice, at least.</p><br><p>"Well, I think Erik knows what to do. It sounds useful, can't deny that, and..." Adam's eyes narrowed, looking at the raging Stellar Flow behind the gates, "It's my only way to get stronger anyway, isn't it?"</p><br><p>Adam was about to leave his inner space when suddenly two bright stars headed in his direction.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze and Moira appeared beside him.</p><br><p>"What...?" Adam tilted his head in confusion, "Do you two need something?"</p><br><p>Lone Blaze nodded, "Something like that. We've been following your musings and... we thought it would be good to give you some advice. Me and Moira hope that if you do, you'll be able to learn your new power faster."</p><br><p>"Sure. I'm all ears." Adam shrugged.</p><br><p>After all, Lone Blaze and Moira were his loyal allies, part of his power, and his Initial Gene. If he didn't trust them, it could only lead to one thing: disaster.</p><br><p>Moira flying around them as if on a pillow waved her hand.</p><br><p>"Adam, it's not as easy for humans to control energy as it is for monsters and artifacts," she glanced at Lone Blaze, "People get energy when they become Phantoms, not from birth, and it also depends a lot on your talent. But, you already know how to control energy as well as your body. It's not something completely new."</p><br><p>Lone Blaze continued, "Think of it like firing a gun. If you've learned how to wield one gun, how to aim and control the recoil, things will go much faster with the next one."</p><br><p>"You know that's not a good example, right?" Adam crossed his arms over his chest.</p><br><p>"Hah... sorry..." Lone Blaze scratched the back of her head awkwardly.</p><br><p>"But, I think I get what you're saying." Adam nodded, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, "It's like a game, if you know how to play one genre you'll quickly get the hang of playing the game of the same genre. The trouble comes only if you try a genre you've never played before, but that's not our case."</p><br><p>Moira and Lone Blaze looked at each other.</p><br><p>They knew about firearms since they had encountered Phantoms on numerous occasions, but... games? This was something out of their world.</p><br><p>"Good." Adam smiled, "Thanks for your help, I think I'll deal with the rest during practice."</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam opened his eyes. A few seconds later, Reinz returned from his inner space as well.</p><br><br><p>The spoon cracked the top of the egg, as Erik pulled out the white with the liquid yolk before taking a bite full of delight.</p><br><p>"You two saw the messages from the Crystal Gates. That's good." Erik nodded, "In that case, we can get down to business. For the next three days, I will leave you with Julia, all your time except for meals and sleep will be spent with her at the arena."</p><br><p>Then, Erik swiped his spoon pointing at Silvana and Chloe.</p><br><p>"While you train with Julia, I will take over the work with your Operators."</p><br><p>Confusion covered their faces.</p><br><p>Reinz sighed, turning to him, "Mr. Erik, forgive my mistrust, but what are you going to do with Chloe and Silvana? Is there a training course that Phantom can do for them as well?"</p><br><p>"No need to apologize, I encourage curiosity. Of course, I won't be fighting against Silvana and Chloe, you don't have to worry about that," a glint passed over his red eyes, "However, they are Operators of the K3-Phantoms, they are getting more power and capabilities."</p><br><p>Erik pointed at Julia.</p><br><p>"Julia and I have come a long way together. Silvana and Chloe are still a long way from what Julia is capable of, but I want to give them some important tips and explain how to work with energy. This is something completely new to them, unlike us Phantoms."</p><br><p>Then, he casually waved his hand, "I realize this sounds strange - Operator training Phantoms and Phantom training Operators, but I think it will be a rewarding experience for all four of you. Think of it as an outsider's perspective."</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"Hah..." with a short laugh, he looked at Julia, "An outsider's perspective? I mean, she's going to beat us up time after time."</p><br><p>"Argh?" Julia frowned, "Do you have something against that? You should be grateful we're wasting our time on you!"</p><br><p>Saying nothing, Adam grabbed a bun off the table and headed for the arena, taking a big bite along the way.</p><br><p>"Nah, I'm fine with it. I just want to get started soon, because... I feel like I've already realized something..."</p><br><p>Without warning, Adam abruptly turned around and threw half of the bun with all his might.</p><br><p>At high speed, the bun flew over the table before smashing into the wall, rattling and cracking the surface as if the bun were stronger than a rock.</p>
