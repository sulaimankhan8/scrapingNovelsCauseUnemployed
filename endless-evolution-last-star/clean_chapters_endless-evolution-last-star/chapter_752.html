            <br><p>Viron and Gnash, one of the observers of the crucial fight, raised their heads upwards.
</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" Gnash gasped watching the four arrows, they had to pay attention.
</p><br><p>Watching the wary monsters and tired archers, Viron narrowed his eyes, his gaze growing colder as this was their opportunity to kill the archer right now - in the future, these monsters would be a serious problem.
</p><br><p>"Wait... The arrows aren’t exploding, that’s weird..."
</p><br><p>Before they could come to any conclusions, a blue flash shone brightly at the top of the spire.
</p><br><p>Viron and Gnash turned around sharply, they immediately noticed a mist emerging in the middle level of the fortress, filling all the passageways. It brought with it a heavy frost, ice crystals covering the stone in a rapidly growing thin grid.
</p><br><p>However, the fog soon accelerated, following the will of its owner - the Blind Sinner.
</p><br><br><p>Within seconds, the fog full of energy disappeared into the cracks, traveling deep underground. All the Phantoms standing outside the fortress or at the bridge felt a chill running down their backs, but not from fear, but from the fact that the temperature dropped significantly.

</p><br><p>A man with a large axe in his hand looked around baffled. He had long defended the bridge from monsters along with the other squad commanders, but this had never happened before.
</p><br><p>"What the hell...? Is this coming from the fortress? Are there monsters with ice attributes here?"
</p><br><p>The woman fighting alongside him for a long time gulped, warily looking around.
</p><br><p>"I don’t know, it’s weird... The irregular energy favors the flame abilities, but... why did it get so cold here then..."
</p><br><p>The Phantoms standing not far from them also noticed the change. For a moment, they felt like ordinary people in simple clothes in the middle of a brutal winter.
</p><br><p>Cold vapor came out with every breath, their cheeks flushed intensely and their fingertips trembled, soon their hands would go numb if they didn’t find a way to warm themselves.
</p><br><p>After a while, the mist began to rise up, covering all the dark lands, it worked its way through the millions of grains of sand among which there were even more gaps.
</p><br><p>Tiny ice crystals lurking among the fog shone brightly from time to time, leaving behind heavy snowflakes quickly forming clumps of snow.
</p><br><p>Before the Phantoms and monsters realized what was happening, one-fifth of the land around the fortress was covered in snow, which seemed to be just the beginning as the fog grew thicker.
</p><br><p>The Lands of the Lone Serpent, here - winter arrived, cold and cruel.
</p><br><p>Apparently, many monsters were not happy with this development, especially those with flame abilities. Snow and frost annoyed them, so they hurried to get rid of it.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>A massive monster with a sturdy body and wide arms released its aura. Its skin was rough and cracked, with lava flowing in the furrows, whose brightness and speed had slowed considerably with the advent of the fog.
</p><br><p>Opening its jaw wide, the monster directed all of its flames toward its back, to a massive outgrowth similar to a tiny volcano.
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, reaching the peak of its power, a powerful stream of flames rushed out of the monster’s back, scattering clots of hot magma to the sides.
</p><br><p>Yet... the monster ran out of energy much faster than it had expected, its two large red eyes wide open in disbelief.
</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.
</p><br><p>Landing on the sand, the magma had no time to spread before it quickly turned into a static gray mass, like a deep freeze.
</p><br><p>A few seconds ago, with a short preparation, the monster could have maintained a stream of flames for a full minute, and the magma clots would cover everything around it creating a lava lake - there was no trace of that power left.
</p><br><p>Seeing this scene, some Phantoms and Operators began to guess what was happening here.
</p><br><p>"The Irregular Energy..."
</p><br><p>Gnash’s voice trembled as he watched the mist become the new master of the lands.
</p><br><p>"It has changed... It can’t be a mistake, the flames are no longer intensified, on the contrary, it seems that now the irregular energy makes all fire much weaker."
</p><br><p>In turn, Viron only nodded meaningfully.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, it seems that way, but... don’t you think it’s not that simple?"
</p><br><br><p>Viron pointed towards one of the purple arrows.
</p><br><p>"Mist and arrows... It looks like that was the archers’ trump card, their most powerful attack, but for some reason, they had to use it for nothing. Their shots didn’t even hit anyone."
</p><br><p>Then, Gnash realized that somehow this situation was similar to starfall.
</p><br><p>"Wait... are those arrows not needed as weapons, but just as a source of energy? But..."
</p><br><p>Gnash turned around as her gaze intuitively traveled upwards.
</p><br><p>"For who or what...?"
</p><br><br><p>Ignoring everything that was happening, the mist quickly headed towards the four arrows, circling around them in an active flow. A little more and the arrows would reach their limit, their frames would collapse releasing energy in an explosion and the mist wouldn’t be able to hold them back.
</p><br><p>But, the mist wasn’t the only player called upon to change the situation.
</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, chains appeared from the ground, one for each arrow. Without delay, the chains clamped tightly around the arrows, like snakes wanting to kill their target - the fog concealed their offense.
</p><br><p>The arrows were unable to maintain their shape for long, after a few seconds, they cracked, about to explode.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, the chains rushed upwards, channeling the mist behind them while absorbing all the energy from the arrows.
</p><br><p>If the four charged arrows hit the Dormant Lord, there would be nothing left of him but pieces of gray crystals, yet he would easily dodge.
</p><br><p>Also, it wouldn’t be enough to destroy all the monsters, but... the Blind Sinner realized that they needed to defend themselves, not fight.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>An active shudder traveled across the surface as the chains hovered in the air, pure energy lurking deep within them from the destroyed arrows. Mist enveloped the chains, giving them the appearance of mysterious stars.
</p><br><p>Then, massive ice crystals as tall and thin as towers rose high up to the level of the stars.
</p><br><p>These towers were much taller than the towers of the fortress but were below the level of the spire.
</p><br><br><p>The Blind Sinner let out a deep hoarse sigh, his plan worked, but there was still one last touch left.
</p><br><br><p>He drew his sword from the hallow as he swung his hand giving orders to his creation.
</p><br><p>Immediately, the chains flung to the sides, each of the towers connected, unleashing brutal torrents of freezing wind - no one was able to escape them.</p>
