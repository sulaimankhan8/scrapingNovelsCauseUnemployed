            <br><p>"What am I supposed to do?" Silvana asked with a serious face looking at Damien from the spectator room, only the protective glass separating them.</p><br><p>Damien shrugged, showing that nothing extraordinary was required of her.</p><br><p>"It's simple, leave the room, wait for the doors to close, and then stand to the left or right of the entrance. Then, wait, it will take Adam a while to use Gene Field for the first time."</p><br><p>Silvana didn't answer immediately. She looked at Damien for some time, pondering where she should stand, and nodded.</p><br><p>"Sure, I'll wait as long as it takes." Silvana cast a glance at Adam before leaving the spectator room.</p><br><p>Then, Damien turned to Adam with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Adam, think about the Gene Cube that surrounds your the Vault. Imagine it could go outside your body, make all the genes you've collected so far quiver as millions of particles that will create a Gene Field for you."</p><br><p>Unlike the other abilities, Adam knew nothing about this one. The information about Gene Field didn't appear in his mind because it wasn't something special or unique, every K2-Phantom could do it, only the magnitude of Gene Field was different.</p><br><p>Adam nodded, closing his eyes and preparing to begin his first attempt.</p><br><p>"Oh, I completely forgot."</p><br><p>But, Damien immediately interrupted him.</p><br><p>"It's unlikely that you'll be able to create a large enough Gene Field the first time. Moreover, since you're a K2-Phantom, the size of your Gene Field is rather limited." Damien scratched the back of his head while looking around.</p><br><p>They had damaged most of the chamber, so he figured that one cut wouldn't make it much worse.</p><br><br><p>Damien grabbed Adam's shoulder firmly before turning into a shadow and appearing with him in front of the protective glass of the spectator room.</p><br><p>Filling his hand with energy, Damien swung his palm upward, using it like a sharp blade.</p><br><p>The next moment, the protective glass split in two, as soon as Douglas blinked he saw Damien and a surprised Adam beside him.</p><br><p>"Damien... damn it, unlike the other damage this isn't concrete or steel, it's a much more expensive material!" Douglas frowned.</p><br><p>Damien smiled nonchalantly with a shrug as if he didn't have any other choice.</p><br><p>"Come on, we have more important things to do than some glass. What's more, it can be repaired."</p><br><p>Damien waved a hand before pointing to the door ahead.</p><br><p>"Right now Silvana is in there, call Gene Field and tell me if Silvana is standing to the left or right."</p><br><p>Damien narrowed his eyes to find out the answer himself, then a slight smirk appeared on his face as if he was pleased with Silvana's choice.</p><br><p>"Alright, I'll give it a try, I have a few questions, but I'll ask them when I tell you where Silvana is standing." Adam said seriously.</p><br><br><p>Adam closed his eyes, he didn't dive into inner space, he just concentrated.</p><br><p>Soon the first minute passed, no change, but... pretty quickly the Vault shuddered. Blue energy streams ran along the edges of the book as hundreds of flashes of various sizes burst out of it.</p><br><p>The flashes crashed into the boundaries of the Gene Cube, unable to go beyond that area.</p><br><p>But, that was the way it was supposed to be.</p><br><p>The Vault simply determined how large a Gene Field would spread from Adam since it was directly dependent on the genes he had.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, all the flashes went back into the Vault and then, the white book finally closed, long after Adam's evolution to K2-Level. The Gene Cube continued to hover around the Vault, it remained unchanged since the Gene Cube had a different task.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A slight ripple appeared around Adam, vibrating the air as it had with Damien, but much fainter.</p><br><p>There was no bright flash or sphere of any particular color, as without using a massive amount of energy only the Phantom himself could see the color of his rapidly spreading Gene Field.</p><br><p>"Finally, I've got it..." Adam muttered with a satisfied expression, his eyes sparkling with slight delight.</p><br><p>A white, translucent sphere surrounded him at arm's length. Only Adam could see that the sphere had a color, for everyone else, it didn't have any.</p><br><p>Sure, Damien and Dahla easily noticed Adam's field, they could feel the fluctuations in space, and with the help of energy, they saw the visual distortions around Adam.</p><br><p>But, there was no way an ordinary human or a weak Phantom would realize that Adam was using the Gene Field, let alone notice it.</p><br><p>"Adam, don't relax, your Gene Field is unstable, moreover, you must increase its size if you want to understand where Silvana is standing." Damien said seriously, seeing the air wavering.</p><br><p>Adam gulped, clenching his fist tightly.</p><br><p>Gradually, Gene Field grew, rather slowly, increasing smoothly and evenly in all directions.</p><br><p>Soon, the Gene Field hit Damien and Douglas as they stood only a few meters away from Adam.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>He never felt like this before, it seemed to him that Damien and Douglas were on his palm, he could feel their presence.</p><br><p>Sure, he already knew that Damien and Douglas were near him, through his hearing, vision, and smell. But, it was as if he had radar inside him, capable of showing the exact location of each target.</p><br><p>"Wow... how unusual. It's probably too early to think about it, but it'll be damn useful in Dead Lands..." Adam muttered, amazed.</p><br><p>Damien nodded with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>Letting out a sigh, Adam continued to increase the area of his Gene Field until he reached the limit. Oddly enough, his Gene Field stopped right at the door, just short of the hallway.</p><br><p>"What...? Is this all I can do?" Adam was confused, even disappointed.</p><br><br><p>Soon a third person entered his Gene Field - Dahla, who stood next to him.</p><br><p>"There's no need to be frustrated. From here to the gate is five meters, which means the diameter of your Gene Field is ten meters. For a K2-Phantom who went through evolution just today, that's an amazing result." Dahla said confidently.</p><br><p>Douglas nodded in confirmation, crossing his arms on his powerful chest.</p><br><p>"Dahla is right. For normal beginners on the K2-Level, five or six meters is considered a decent result, weaker and less talented Phantoms in general can only reach three meters in their first use of the Gene Field."</p><br><p>Adam nodded. He didn't feel any pride or superiority over that fact. He decided that such a difference was caused because he was a Natural Phantom and stayed at the K1-Level longer than many.</p><br><br><p>Damien put his hand on Adam's back, pushing him forward slightly.</p><br><p>Thus, Adam took a few steps forward and the entire aisle fell into his Gene Field.</p><br><p>"So... Where is Silvana?" Damien asked, looking at Adam with interest.</p><br><p>Adam couldn't see, hear or smell Silvana's scent, only with the help of the Gene Field could he get an answer to the question.</p><br><p>This was a test for Adam to make sure he learned Gene Field to the fullest.</p><br><p>Could he try to guess, since there were only two options, left or right?</p><br><p>Sure, but that would be a serious mistake.</p><br><br><p>Adam smirked lifting his gaze and staring at the doors as if he could see through them.</p><br><br><p>He could clearly see Silvana's silhouette who stood in the center, right behind the door, neither to the left nor to the right.</p>
