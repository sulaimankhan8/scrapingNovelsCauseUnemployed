            <h4>Chapter 1061: Saegar, the Proud Wing (Part 2)</h4><br><p>The awkward silence broke as soon as Saegar revealed his smile, light and seemingly sincere.
</p><br><p>Adam could understand when a human, or in this case, a monster, was trying to play a game to fulfill his devious plans, but... he was not on the level to understand what lurked in Saegar’s mind.
</p><br><p>"Kenward... My old friend. I didn’t expect to see you so soon. I thought you’d spend the next few years watching your trees as usual."
</p><br><p>"Hmm? You got a problem with that?"
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a calm but heavy aura emerged from Kenward.
</p><br><p>The maids in the distance caught their breath as the veins in their necks inflated, trying to deal with the pressure.
</p><br><p>Saegar cast a glance in the direction of the girls and waved his hand.
</p><br><p>"Of course not. You know, I think the dew trees are one of the most beautiful wonders of this world, don’t you? Hah." He leaned forward. "I’ve offered to buy just one many times, and you’ve never agreed. It just goes to show how valuable they are."
</p><br><p>"I don’t recall you ever turning down the idea."
</p><br><p>Saegar shrugged, touching his jaw as sharp as a dagger. "Well, it’s enough for me that I can enjoy their light from afar at night."
</p><br><br><p>He snapped his fingers as the maids came into motion setting the drinks on the table. Some of them remained against the walls with dishes in their hands, they awaited the next command.
</p><br><p>"Kenward and..." Saegar glanced at Adam. "Young guest from distant lands, or rather from a great, lonely fortress. Please, as my guests, take a seat at the table."
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, it was only then that Kenward stepped forward.
</p><br><p>He was ready to rush into battle if Saegar insulted the trees, but at the same time respected that this was Saegar’s home while they were his guests.
</p><br><p>Adam was nervous, it was evident both in his sweating forehead and his racing heartbeat.
</p><br><p>He only heard of the Lords from Arnoth, his last and strongest adversary. These were creatures he expected to meet only at the end of his journey when he would become a Second Rank Phantom, no less.
</p><br><br><p>He sat next to one Lord, across from the other, while the monster maid girls poured drinks into crystal glasses.
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes darted toward the bottle. It looked and smelled just like a bottle of expensive wine that could only be found in luxury restaurants.
</p><br><p>"You shouldn’t be so surprised."
</p><br><p>"Agh?" Adam turned around to see Saegar’s amused expression.
</p><br><p>"This isn’t some slop or... I don’t know, maggot blood. It’s wine, the real thing, from juicy, delicious grapes."
</p><br><p>Adam’s pupils narrowed.
</p><br><br><p>At the red feast? At the restaurant at the First Ring? Or in the lands of the strongest monsters?
</p><br><p>"W-Wine?" he stammered, lowering his gaze to his glass. "But... I’ve never seen such a thing, from any monsters."
</p><br><p>Before the encounter, Adam was ready to keep quiet and answer only important questions, but something in the atmosphere established by Saegar made him talk like at a normal dinner.
</p><br><p>It didn’t seem at all like it was supposed to be.
</p><br><p>"Hah, other monsters? Looks like this isn’t the first time you’ve worked with monsters, and this is while you’re still at the K3-Level. Damn, if there were more humans like you, my life wouldn’t be so boring!"
</p><br><p>Saegar took the bottle from the maid’s hands.
</p><br><p>"Yes, Adam, this wine, and it was made by my people, from start to finish. From the first grape seeds to the addition of sugar, fermentation, bottling, and cooling. Hahaha, if this wine were to make it to the Citadel, it would be labeled - ’Made by Monsters.’!"
</p><br><p>Adam smiled nervously.
</p><br><p>All his expectations were shattered. Saegar was very different from the calm, wise, and somewhat mysterious Kenward. He was talkative, and active, and knew a frightening amount compared to the other monsters.
</p><br><p>Something had to be answered. Needed to keep the conversation going if he wanted to accomplish his goal.
</p><br><p>"Khm," Adam coughed. "In that case, I’d like to try it. Last time I was offered to eat maggots and roots, talking about how delicious they were, but I didn’t take a risk."
</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Saegar nodded deeply as he slowly raised his glass.
</p><br><p>"The thing is, young Phantom, you can’t stand the food that monsters like, even if they are monsters that own a name. However, we monsters are omnivores. Maggot or pizza? Hah, as long as it tastes good!"
</p><br><p>Saegar’s eyes narrowed as he stared at Adam.
</p><br><p>"So, young Phantom. What’s your name? You’re sitting at my table, but it’s still a mystery to me."
</p><br><br><p>"Adam Vinter. I’m pleased to meet you."
</p><br><p>In fact, Adam wasn’t lying. If his first visit to the Dark Shore didn’t end in his death, it was a valuable experience on his journey.
</p><br><p>"Great name, boy!" Saegar exclaimed as he raised his glass, the wine almost spilling over the rim. "In that case, let’s drink for you, young Phantom!"
</p><br><p>Simultaneously, the three of them took a sip. Kenward did not say much, but as an honored guest, he did not refuse the drink.
</p><br><br><p>Sweetness and a slight sourness filled Adam’s mouth, though he braced himself for the worst. He didn’t believe that monsters could create a wine, a beverage suited to human taste preferences.
</p><br><br><p>Kenward set the empty glass down with a deep sigh.
</p><br><p>"I must admit, your wine is far better than bland flowerbeds."
</p><br><p>Saegar waved his hand in indignation.
</p><br><p>"Hey! You can say what you want about me, but the maids take care of the flowers, they do a fine job. Don’t insult my girls!"
</p><br><p>A few maids blushed, some giggled, but quickly regained their posture.
</p><br><p>Kenward smiled bitterly.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, but you pick the flowers. You need to work on your taste."
</p><br><p>"Pfffft! This coming from a man who sits under the sun in a hat and scarf!" Saegar snorted with a gesture showing the maid to fill their glasses.
</p><br><p>Then, as the crimson liquid filled their glasses, Saegar leaned forward as darkness ran across his eyes.
</p><br><p>"So... Adam Vinter... What brings you here? You know. Usually, Phantoms like you die before taking five breaths. You’ve lived much longer than that and I want to know why..."</p>
