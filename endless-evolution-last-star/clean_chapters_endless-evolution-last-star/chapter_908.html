            <br><br><p>With a confident stride, Erik entered the room, looking at the two still-sleeping young men.</p><br><p>After the last battle, Adam and Reinz spent all their strength and passed out. Some because of exhaustion and some due to a serious wound.</p><br><p>However, enough time has passed for them to recover and get a good night's sleep.</p><br><p>With a lone clap, Erik exclaimed:</p><br><p>"Wake up! The morning waits for no one, and neither do I!"</p><br><p>Startled by the sharp sound, Adam rolled over and fell off the bed. However, he was in no hurry to get up. His eyes slowly opened, looking at the rays of sunlight streaming through the window.</p><br><p>"Yeah... Good morning..." he muttered.</p><br><p>Reinz shook his head, trying to wake up. He wanted to sleep some more but realized that if he didn't get up now he would be lying in bed for hours.</p><br><p>"Julia let me know what you did yesterday. Looks like you both mastered the Infusive Energy Control, doesn't it?" Erik chuckled briefly.</p><br><p>Remaining on the ground, Adam glanced at him.</p><br><p>"Yes." Adam nodded weakly, "It turned out to be more complicated than I thought. Though, if we'd realized what we had to do right away, we could have mastered the third type in a few hours."</p><br><p>Erik shrugged. With a wave of his hand, he headed down the passage stopping at the doorway.</p><br><p>"Good to hear. Breakfast is waiting, then I'll take your exam. If you've mastered the Full Energy Control you should have no trouble showing me that, and...</p><br><p>"It will also be no problem for you to break the second orb and open the second lesser gates. You got the main reward through your own efforts, but the energy from the Stellar Flow will make you much stronger."</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz's eyes sparkled.</p><br><p>They had forgotten that Full Energy Control was not only a way to become stronger but also a requirement for opening the second lesser gates.</p><br><br><p>Strangely enough, Erik was alone in the kitchen. Julia, Silvana, and Chloe seemed to have just vanished.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Where is everyone?" Adam tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>Erik picked up a knife, spreading butter on a crusty slice of bread.</p><br><p>"Don't worry, they'll be back by tonight. While you were trying to master the Infusive Energy Control, Julia was giving Silvana and Chloe their training, and..." he shook his head disapprovingly, "Poor girls, if that's what Julia is doing, it's not training, it's torture."</p><br><br><p>Adam sat down at the table, pushing his plate closer to him with a mountain of heavily fried bacon to a deep crisp.</p><br><br><p>"Sure." Erik nodded deeply, cracking a hard-boiled egg with a light motion of his hand, "She realized you're all done - that means it's the end of training. This morning when I saw them, there wasn't a living spot on Silvana and Chloe. But, they'll be fine. I'm sure they're resting now for all the hardship."</p><br><p>The still sleepy Reinz yawned, but couldn't keep his interest away, "Mr. Erik, I'm sure both you and Mrs. Julia know what you're doing, but what kind of training did Silvana and Chloe have?"</p><br><p>"Hmm... I've been watching them expend their energy, but Julia has taken up their physical training. They don't have a lot of options yet, so Julia was building up their stamina and giving them some tips. I'm sure the next time you have a real fight you'll feel the difference. Well, when you decide to use one of your Operator's abilities."</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz glanced over at each other but didn't ask anything more. They had the important task of passing Erik's test, they focused on that. Sure, they had another day in store, but they didn't want to leave it to the last minute.</p><br><p>Right after breakfast, Adam and Reinz headed to the arena. This time, Reinz stood in front of Erik, while Adam waited on the sidelines.</p><br><br><p>Erik threw the sword to Reinz, who deftly caught it.</p><br><p>"The rules are as follows - each of you will have two attacks. One for the Outer Energy Control and one for the Infusive Energy Control. I will block your attack and give my judgment. Don't try to hit as hard as you can - I'm not testing your strength, but your mastery."</p><br><p>Reinz nodded deeply, gripping the hilt tightly.</p><br><p>With a deep breath, he leaped forward, finding himself in front of a relaxed Erik. Following his pace, Reinz brought his sword full of energy down on his opponent.</p><br><p>Without haste, Erik raised his right hand, stopping Reinz's sword with his palm. Strangely enough, the blade couldn't even touch his skin, the layer of energy between his hand and the sword was too dense.</p><br><p>This was not what Reinz had expected, however. There were no sparks or tremors, it seemed that Erik's energy was absorbing all signs of Reinz's strike's existence.</p><br><br><p>At the end of the momentum, Reinz bounced back. Without delay, he tossed his sword aside and used his order.</p><br><p>As soon as the gauntlets and boots covered his arms and legs, Reinz turned into a lightning flash.</p><br><p>Like an electrical discharge, Reinz raced around the arena, gradually gaining speed. He wanted to build up as much momentum as possible before he delivered his hit.</p><br><p>Erik pretended to be completely unconcerned, but his eyes moved slightly following Reinz's every move.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Reinz appeared in front of Erik, caving his leg in at the speed of sound. If Adam was hit by such a strike, his wound would be far more serious than a few broken ribs.</p><br><p>Erik's smile grew wider for a moment before he grabbed Reinz's ankle.</p><br><p>The electrical discharges tried to turn Erik to ash - he was Reinz's target, but... none of the charges could even reach him.</p><br><p>The difference in their strength was great enough that the simple energy nullified all of Reinz's attempts.</p><br><p>"Good." Erik nodded as he lightly tossed Reinz to the other side of the arena.</p><br><p>Reinz did a somersault landing deftly on the ground, his breathing heavy - waiting for his assessment.</p><br><p>"You passed. Very good." Erik nodded once more before turning to his left.</p><br><p>Adam met him with a bored look.</p><br><p>"Now it's your turn. Go ahead and show what you can do. Heh... After all, you almost killed Reinz yesterday."</p>
