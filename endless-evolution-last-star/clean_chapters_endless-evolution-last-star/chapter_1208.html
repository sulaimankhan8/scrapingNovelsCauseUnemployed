            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1208: White Blast (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>One against thirteen—that was the situation Fromund found himself in. Unlike the Kirani Bugs, which were too weak to compete with most Black Threat Level monsters, the thunder monsters, and especially Marhen, were on a slightly different level.</p><br><p>Perhaps in a one-on-one fight, none of them were a match for Fromund, but the difference between them was not so great that their numerical superiority did not matter.</p><br><p>By working together, they could certainly cause him a lot of trouble and had a good chance of winning. Most of them believed this.</p><br><p>Marhen thrust his arm forward as he proclaimed:</p><br><p>“Surround him! We’ll attack one at a time!”</p><br><p>He acted like a commander, and the thunder monsters obeyed him without any objections. In fact, even in front of Bathild, they would not have been so obedient. Well, most likely because of their fear of her power, they would have done what she said anyway, but it was the same with Marhen.</p><br><p>During such missions, he was always the one who commanded the formations and fighters. Bathild was their leader, but that was because she was the strongest and always dealt with the greatest threats.</p><br><p>Marhen, on the other hand, was a commander respected by the other monsters for his patience, strategic thinking, and the victories he had brought to their territory.</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, all the thunder monsters activated their auras at full power, trying to suppress Fromund, who was in the center.</p><br><p>Perhaps they could have done this against another Phantom, but not against Fromund. He felt almost no pressure.</p><br><p>Well, perhaps the reason for this was that Marhen had not yet entered the battle.</p><br><p>He stared intently at Fromund, studying his reaction to their attack, like a hunter gradually hunting a wild beast.</p><br><p>Usually, when Phantoms and monsters clashed, the roles were reversed. In most cases, it was the Phantoms who prepared and went on a mission to defeat a particularly dangerous monster.</p><br><p>The higher the monsters and humans rose on the evolutionary ladder, the more dangerous each side became, especially the Phantoms.</p><br><p>Sure, among the White Threat and Purple Threat levels, there were many monsters that almost any Phantom could handle, but there were also those that seemed invincible — the Plague Reaper was one of them.</p><br><p>Also, it was important to remember that if a Phantom had survived to the K4 level, it meant that several hundred who had not been able to do so had died along the way.</p><br><p>For the same reason, regardless of the Threat Level, the mortality rate among monsters was almost the same, and the higher the Threat Level, the more monsters killed each other, because there were not enough Phantoms of sufficient strength.</p><br><p>The Kirani Bugs needed several weeks or months to reach the Black Threat Level after birth. Other monsters with smaller populations were born at this level immediately.</p><br><p>Phantoms were not capable of this. They had to go all the way from K0-Level to K4-Level and not die.</p><br><p>A good comparison would be an old hunter or hitman. If a person had survived so many years in such a dangerous job where most died young, then he was one of the most dangerous and experienced in his field.</p><br><p>So, the Black Threat monsters had to be careful when they encountered a K4 Phantom, especially if it was Adam Vinter’s partner.</p><br><p>“Hey, Mr. Commander.” Fromund waved his hand. “Are you going to take part or what?”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Marhen nodded deeply. He had seen enough; it was time for the next test.</p><br><p>“Sure, let’s see how long the confidence in your eyes lasts.”</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Marhen’s aura, a blue flame full of electrical discharges, quickly turned into a monster with a long cape behind which the silhouette of two ghostly wings could be seen.</p><br><p>The other monsters followed his example.</p><br><p>If they had the opportunity to strike the first blow against Fromund with their auras, they had to take it, right now.</p><br><p>Fromund looked around, a dozen Spirits staring intently at him, wild monsters, beasts, and warriors, as well as several creatures with terrifying forms.</p><br><p>No matter how confident Fromund appeared, his smile faded at that moment. He felt the pressure, and soon his aura could break.</p><br><p>‘Come on, do it. Show them your Spirit.’ Arayna’s sweet voice rang in Fromund’s head. “I know you want to block their Spirits with just your aura, but it’s impossible. You have to understand that.”</p><br><p>True, sometimes Fromund’s arrogance had a negative effect on him, but this time he couldn’t be so reckless.</p><br><p>After all, Adam was fighting upstairs. If something went wrong, Fromund had to be ready to help him.</p><br><p>“Alright, you asked for it!”</p><br><p>As soon as his words reached the walls, his aura turned into a bright flame. Soon, a figure in magnificent armor appeared from the pillar of fire, glancing at the other Spirits.</p><br><p>A bright orb, like a tiny sun, burned in the warrior’s chest.</p><br><p>Then, Fromund’s Spirit slowly spread his arms, causing the streams of flame to disperse, driving the monster Spirits back like frightened animals.</p><br><p>The only one who could resist long enough was Marhen, but in the end, he too had to retreat and return his Spirit to a calm state.</p><br><p>“Hey, do you always start your fights like this?” Fromund asked, staring intently at Marhen. He saw no threat in the others, nor any reason to fear them.</p><br><p>Marhen raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>“Sure. Does that surprise you? It seems like you’re used to winning by charging into battle like a bull, but I can’t afford to do that. I have to be careful and use all my abilities.”</p><br><p>“Pffft!” Fromund snorted, disappointed by the answer. “Because you’re weak! You need to be able to grab your enemy by the throat and slam his face into the ground!”</p><br><p>In response, Marhen shrugged.</p><br><p>They were creatures from different worlds, and not because one of them was a monster and the other a human. Their fighting styles were too different.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, a spear of flame and lightning appeared in Marhen’s hand, as he gripped the weapon tightly like a projectile.</p><br><p>“Maybe I should listen to you just this once.”</p><br><p>Fromund grinned, gripping his spear more tightly.</p>
