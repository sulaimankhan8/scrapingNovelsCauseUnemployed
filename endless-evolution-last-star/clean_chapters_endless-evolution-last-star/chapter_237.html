            <br><p>Magnus made Adam think about what Thunder Demon might taste like, though Adam didn't want to ponder it, his mind was no longer unstoppable.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, his Evolution Tree activated, shaking slightly and putting Adam's genes into a fighting state, his veins swelling up like during Resonance, but only in the facial area.</p><br><p>"Hmm? What's that?" Adam muttered, touching his face, clearly puzzled.</p><br><br><p>"It's your body's reaction."</p><br><p>Then, Magnus sat down on the couch:</p><br><p>"Anyway, let's do it this way. Now, I'll show you roughly what kind of monster you'll need to eat, and we'll run some tests. We'll start the treatment tomorrow, and tonight, the four of us, will go to the feast." Magnus narrowed his eyes, waiting for Adam's response.</p><br><p>He needed Adam to test regeneration on someone strong enough and truly wounded. It would allow him to have another successful precedent and hone his skills.</p><br><p>'Come on. Agree. These weaklings are good for nothing. Their bodies are too weak to allow me to gather more information. Someone like you won't want a mediocre result. They will strive for the best, so this will be valuable information.' Magnus pondered, twiddling his fingers nervously.</p><br><p>Magnus's method was already proven and working, but like any scientist, he needed more data. Moreover, convincing Phantom for a dangerous procedure was not easy, for Magnus's way was risky due to its nature.</p><br><p>"For the feast?" Adam raised an eyebrow, "Fine, I won't turn down such a rare opportunity. But, don't think too much of it. The most important thing for me is to heal my arm."</p><br><p>Magnus grinned widely as he nodded slightly.</p><br><p>"Of course, besides, a new experience never hurts." Magnus rubbed his palms like a merchant making a good deal.</p><br><p>Then, he rose and waved his long coat.</p><br><p>"Come on. I'll show you how I'm going to heal your arm!" Magnus spoke out in excitement.</p><br><p>Adam, Silvana, and Nessa followed him.</p><br><p>Adam agreed for several reasons. First, he was curious to see the people who had access to monster meat. Secondly, by refusing, he risked angering Magnus. While Magnus was treating him, Adam should have avoided worsening the relationship.</p><br><p>And... He had a natural desire to taste the monster meat. There was nothing Adam could do about the fact that he had a strong appetite.</p><br><br><br><p>They descended to the lower level of the building, and it was here that the real laboratory began, not just Magnus's personal museum.</p><br><p>The long passageway was full of mechanical doors with something behind them.</p><br><br><p>He felt the same way again as when he had entered this building. However, this time, the tension was much stronger, as if something forbidden was behind those doors.</p><br><p>'What a strange smell... Shit, even if Magnus wants to appear benevolent, though strange, he wouldn't become a scientist just because of his intelligence...' Adam pondered as he looked at one of the doors.</p><br><p>He wanted to take a step forward, but just at that moment, Nessa appeared in front of him, who seemed to just walk past him.</p><br><p>"Mr. Adam, we are almost there, please don't get distracted. We have much to do before the feast begins." Nessa said seriously.</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a calm face.</p><br><br><p>Before following Nessa, he cast another glance at the door, his eyes narrowed, but he didn't interfere with Magnus's business. One way or another, he needed to heal his arm, he had no other important mission.</p><br><br><p>The massive iron door closed behind them, and they found themselves in a dark room. Normally, the lights were on all the time, but Magnus deliberately turned them off, he wanted to make a show of it.</p><br><p>Magnus grinned as he waved his hand.</p><br><p>At the same moment, gradually, the lights turned on, moving from their point to the center of the room, where there was a huge pod.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, there was a monster inside, alive and seemingly full of strength.</p><br><p>"What kind of monster is that...?" Adam muttered, looking at the unusual creature.</p><br><p>The monster looked like a Crown Type, but its aura wasn't powerful enough, and it didn't look like it had gone through dozens of battles to reach its peak.</p><br><p>The monster had no skin, only flesh that was fused in many places, covering its entire body. The legs were crooked, with misshapen joints and bones, and the same was true of the arms, which ended in six long, sharp claws.</p><br><p>From the monster's back protruded four outgrowths with long bone blades. The head was hairless like the rest of the body, the monster had two eyes.</p><br><p>The ears and nose were missing, and the mouth was difficult to open because of the joint pieces of flesh that stretched when the jaw moved.</p><br><p>"ROOOOAAAAAARRRR!!!"</p><br><p>At the sight of Magnus, the monster's eyes went wide as it roared furiously, easily scaring Silvana and Nessa, it wasn't the first time she had heard it, but she still got goosebumps running through her body.</p><br><p>The monster tried to break through the pod with its sharp claws, but it was unsuccessful. Inside, the pod was covered in blue glass, previously part of the monster, with a good defense. Thus, this monster couldn't even scratch this barrier.</p><br><p>It seemed like the military had to use such glass for their shields to protect themselves from monsters. Well, if the military, like ants, could lift a weight several times their own, it might work.</p><br><p>However, it should not be forgotten that even if a mere human had a weapon capable of killing any monster in one attack, it would make no difference. The monster would get close to the man and kill him before he could blink an eye.</p><br><p>Weapons and equipment weren't enough to fight monsters, it took the right skills, physical stats, and instincts.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, he's always so loud. Don't mind him." Magnus chuckled evilly.</p><br><p>Silvana walked over to Adam.</p><br><p>"It's Crimson Sacrificer..." Silvana muttered, "It's Prime One, Purple Threat Level, White Book."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>"It's a Prime Crimson Sacrificer, and yet only a White Book?"</p><br><p>Magnus nodded, stepping into the conversation.</p><br><p>"Adam, as you know, monsters are divided into Types, however, you should realize that there are also categories. For example, bird-like monsters or insect-like monsters, right?"</p><br><p>Adam nodded silently, not understanding what Magnus was getting at.</p><br><p>"Well, if you want to heal your arm, you'll have to eat a similar monster."</p><br><p>"Similar? Is this monster special in any way? Its aura isn't particularly strong... Though, probably, that's because it's weakened." Adam said, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.</p><br><p>"Nah." Magnus waved his hand nonchalantly, "He's on full alert. Yeah, this monster is special, because it deserves to have its own category. Well, you'll understand everything now."</p><br><p>"Agh?" Adam tilted his head.</p><br><br><p>Magnus clicked the remote, and suddenly the pod opened, releasing Crimson Sacrificer from the cage.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide. However, even Nessa was shocked. Yes, they were running experiments, but she and Magnus were still ordinary people!</p><br><br><p>In a few leaps, the Crimson Sacrificer appeared right in front of Magnus, with burning hatred in its gaze. It seemed that the monster's main goal was to destroy Magnus, specifically, for all the pain and suffering.</p><br><p>Magnus only smirked, shoving his hands into his pockets.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam's fist crashed into the monster's head, blasting it into small pieces.</p><br><p>"Damn, what the fuck did you do?" Adam frowned, brushing the blood off his fist.</p><br><p>"Hey, you're not done." Magnus smirked.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam turned around only to see Crimson Sacrificer's head, recovering quickly.</p>
