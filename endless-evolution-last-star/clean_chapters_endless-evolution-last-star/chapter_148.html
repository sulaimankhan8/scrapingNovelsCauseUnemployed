            <br><p>"He's not a simple K1-Phantom, right...?" Trana whispered so that only Krana could hear her.</p><br><p>Krana nodded as her gaze became serious. It was quite rare for that to happen.</p><br><p>"He just got into Fall Hill Prison today, so... we haven't had time to gather all the information about him yet. What's more, my Operator said that someone is interfering with them, as if someone doesn't want us to know about his accomplishments in Dead Lands."</p><br><p>"Anyway... Be careful sister. I can see that he's untrained in the use of aura, but... he has more than enough combat experience for all Guardians..." Trana muttered with a dark look.</p><br><br><p>Whoooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>Krana and Trana swung their scythes, blades touching causing a cascade of sparks. Then, they simultaneously lunged forward, aiming straight for Adam, from different directions.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils narrowed as he summoned the silver needle, taking a step back.</p><br><p>Krana's scythe blade swept right in front of his eyes, while Trana's weapon moved towards his stomach.</p><br><p>'Quick!' Adam internally exclaimed, managing to block Trana's attack at the last moment.</p><br><p>Trana's eyes went wide, she didn't seem to understand why her scythe couldn't cut through Adam's silver needle.</p><br><p>"Something wrong?" Adam smirked before turning around and kicking Trana right in the stomach.</p><br><br><p>Her mouth and eyes went wide with pain, and for a few seconds, she couldn't even breathe. Apparently, Adam's kick was more powerful than she had realized and was ready to take.</p><br><p>Perhaps in Krana's place, any older sister would have started to worry about her younger one, but Krana was well aware of what Trana was capable of. She wasn't going to waste her time with useless worries!</p><br><br><p>Instead, Krana's movements became faster and deadlier. She was going to overwhelm Adam, not allowing him to have even one free second!</p><br><p>Cascades of sparks flew off to the sides, while Krana's green hair appeared here and there, like a haunting ghost that would never let go of Adam.</p><br><p>It had been a long time since Adam had faced such pressure. He felt that, unlike Narata, Krana had combat experience, and they hadn't used their abilities yet!</p><br><p>"Sister!" Trana exclaimed as she appeared behind Adam.</p><br><p>Krana only nodded slightly.</p><br><p>Then, they stretched their arms forward, and their eyes shone brightly, they acted quickly and synchronized. It was obvious that if they weren't the most coordinated of sisters, they were excellent fighters in pairs.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the air in front of their palms trembled, followed by wind currents that rained down directly on Adam from both sides.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide as he put the needle in front of him, in an attempt to defend himself against the direct attack, but... He realized too late that the streams didn't have a single point where the full power of the blow was concentrated.</p><br><p>Such an attack could only be blocked by a massive shield or a wide barrier, but not by a thin needle!</p><br><br><p>Streams of wind quickly nailed Adam to the wall, tearing his clothes to shreds like hundreds of tiny blades. Even the energy barrier couldn't resist, shattering into shards and letting the wind through, which left many cuts on the white wall.</p><br><p>"Don't stop!" Krana exclaimed before turning her hand and intensifying her wind stream.</p><br><p>Trana nodded and did the same.</p><br><p>This was a form of their First Order, something Adam had, for his First Order - Weaver's Needle, had two grips that worked as forms of ability. He could use them depending on the situation.</p><br><p>Lola's eyes went wide, with incipient anxiety inside. She wasn't a Phantom and couldn't fully understand how strong Adam or Krana with Trana was, but she knew that the barrier was extremely strong. Not every Phantom was capable of breaking it down so easily!</p><br><p>"Krana and Trana have similar abilities and weapons... Hmm, I've always wondered how they could be so lucky..." Lola muttered, touching her lips thoughtfully.</p><br><p>"Lucky? You seem to be missing something." Edir smirked, finishing his milkshake, but the cook girl was already preparing another one for him. He was making the most of his opportunities as a prisoner, and he wasn't embarrassed about it at all.</p><br><p>Maybe he just didn't have a conscience...</p><br><p>"What...?" Lola gave him a questioning look.</p><br><p>Edir grinned, leaning on his arm and looking intently at Krana and Trana.</p><br><p>"Creating similar Nexuses is not difficult at all. I think you should know that, even though you're an ordinary person, you have a special position, so... you know more than others."</p><br><p>Lola nodded silently.</p><br><p>"To get similar abilities, you have to kill similar monsters or the same monster, you've thought of that, haven't you?" Edir uttered with a slight shake of his hand.</p><br><p>"Yes... Isn't that right? If it's not about luck, then they got similar genes on purpose." Lola shrugged. It seemed obvious to her.</p><br><p>Edir shook his head, showing how naive and clueless Lola was.</p><br><p>"Each Phantom, even if they are twins, has their own unique Evolution Tree. Thus, even if Krana and Trana killed two identical monsters and received two identical Initial Genes, their Evolution Trees would make adjustments to their future development." Edir said calmly. He didn't mind sharing this knowledge with Lola, which not every Phantom possessed.</p><br><p>"I see... Because of the Evolution Tree, Krana and Trana would have slightly different abilities..." Lola nodded understandingly, "In that case... How did they do it?"</p><br><p>Edir waved his hand.</p><br><p>"It's simple. They killed the twin monsters."</p><br><p>Lola's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"There are such things? I mean... My adoptive father told me about the different Monster Types... Prime, Crown Type, and a few others..." Lola scratched the back of her head awkwardly.</p><br><p>Edir nodded with a sly smile.</p><br><p>"Sure, but it's not a separate Type, after all, twin monsters don't have any unique features or outstanding strength. They are simply rare monsters, as rare as Twin Phantoms are. Such monsters have perfect synergy and almost the same set of genes. They, like humans, must have been born at the same moment from the same creature."</p><br><p>"Oh... You know so much... Unbelievable..." Lola was genuinely amazed.</p><br><p>Edir just shrugged as if it wasn't something important, or worthy of praise.</p><br><p>"I can't know this for sure, but I'm sure Azure Lotus put a lot of effort into finding and catching suitable twin monsters. As I said earlier, they are rare and valuable."</p><br><p>Lola nodded, moving her gaze back to the battle.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."</p><br><p>Krana and Trana were breathing heavily, it was obvious that the prolonged use of wind currents had cost them quite a lot of energy. However, it wasn't something critical, they would fully recover after a while.</p><br><p>True, it was only First Order - the lowest energy-consuming ability in any Phantom's arsenal. However, when using the forms, a lot could change.</p><br><p>In Krana and Trana's case, their energy expenditure depended on how long they would maintain the wind currents.</p><br><p>"Were we able to get him?" Trana asked, casting a glance at Krana.</p><br><p>"I don't know, probably yes. Obviously not enough to defeat him, but... we definitely should have seriously injured him." Krana said, waving her scythe, staring intently at the cloud of dust that rose due to the debris of the walls.</p><br><p>Soon, the smoke veil settled, revealing Adam's silhouette and his silver needle - completely intact.</p><br><p>A few trickles of blood ran down his muscular torso, but... this was not at all the result Krana and Trana had hoped for.</p><br><p>"What the fuck..." Trana muttered in a disbelief.</p><br><p>Adam's wounds didn't look like blade cuts, but as if sharp shards of glass had pierced into his chest. Sure, the wind had been able to cut through his skin and cause blood, but there were more scratches than cuts.</p><br><p>"Tsk. Just as I thought. He has Elemental Root." Krana snorted with a great grimace.</p><br><p>Trana's eyes grew wider.</p><br><p>"What?! Are you sure...?!"</p><br><p>Krana nodded confidently.</p><br><p>"He didn't use any defense ability, that's for sure. In that case, he was only able to withstand our attack so well because of his natural resistance to elemental damage. You know you can only achieve such a thing with Elemental Root."</p><br><p>Trana sighed heavily, then she smiled widely.</p><br><p>"I see... However, we didn't expect such a simple attack to be enough to defeat him, did we?" Trana smirked, preparing for the next attack.</p><br><br><br><p>Adam slowly stepped forward, glaring intently at his opponents. He felt slightly annoyed because the wind was not what he had expected from Krana and Trana.</p><br><p>story-source-MVLeMpYr</p><br><p>"Hey, I wasn't willing to fight you so you could try to nail me to the wall with mere wind! Show me your auras! I'm sure you know how to use them!" Adam said menacingly, leaning his torso forward.</p><br><p>Electric shocks traveled across his eyes as well as a sharp glint across his silver needle. He was ready to attack at any moment.</p><br><br><p>Krana and Trana were not going to honor his request. They had their own vision of battle!</p><br><p>Their eyes shone brightly with golden light as well as their palms as if a radiant sun with great heat lurked within them!</p>
