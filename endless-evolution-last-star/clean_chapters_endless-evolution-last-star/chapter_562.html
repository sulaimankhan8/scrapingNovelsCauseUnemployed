            <br><p>"Don't just stand there. Come over here." Kogen said with a slight wave of his hand.</p><br><p>Adam frowned slightly but didn't refuse. After all, they were now at Kogen's home. It was one of the residences of the Noukx Family, which meant it belonged to Kogen since he was the current head.</p><br><br><p>After a few steps, Adam stood in front of Kogen, looking up at the ninth wing and the massive structure in the distance.</p><br><p>"Is that the Moon Colosseum?" Adam asked, his eyes growing wide for a moment.</p><br><p>Kogen nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yeah, just imagine, in a few hours you'll be fighting. You decided to use the main entrance from the circular ring, but that's not the only way into the ninth wing. Right now, there are hundreds of people heading this way to take seats at the Moon Colosseum."</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, staring around the arena where he would soon come and not as a viewer, but as a fighter.</p><br><p>The high walls, as if striving to touch the stars, curved inward slightly at their peaks, covering part of the arena with their tops.</p><br><p>The Moon Colosseum, like most of the buildings in the First Ring and throughout the Citadel, was made of new materials and looked futuristic. Beyond the perfectly round arena, there were thousands of seats coming in waves from the bottom to the top.</p><br><p>Sure, as in all such buildings, the seats came with different price categories, but even the most ordinary ones cost quite a lot as there were too many people who wanted to watch the fights taking place at the Moon Colosseum.</p><br><p>The Moon Colosseum was a special arena, to fight here one needed a special event or reason. Moreover, approval from the Noukx Family was necessary.</p><br><p>"Beautiful, isn't it?" Kogen said, a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>Adam turned, casting a quick glance at the one who was in charge of the place, not only in the Crimson Eye but in the entire ninth wing.</p><br><p>Kogen was actually young. Well, he was considerably older than Adam, but it was obvious that Kogen was not yet thirty. He was strong, otherwise he wouldn't be able to get his place as head of the family, but becoming that strong before twenty was simply impossible.</p><br><p>"Yeah, I hope I don't have to eat my opponent alive." Adam said calmly, looking intently at Kogen, who was smiling slyly.</p><br><p>Kogen raised an eyebrow at Adam's comment. He realized that Adam knew about the fight that made him who he was, about how he killed his uncle - Geradin Noukx.</p><br><p>"Well, that's up to you." Kogen spread his hands apart, "The Rule of Power lasts until one side wins. And... victory can come in many different ways. Regardless of what you decide to do, no one will judge you here, in the ninth wing."</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly, crossed his arms over his chest, and continued to stare at the Moon Colosseum.</p><br><p>Kogen turned around, glaring at the others.</p><br><p>"Hey. Don't just stand on the sidelines! Come on over, there's plenty of room!"</p><br><br><p>Gladius and Baren immediately burst forward, a few seconds later they were sitting on the couch, Gladius took the left edge and the right one went to Baren.</p><br><p>Soon, almost the whole place was taken, only Silvana who instead of sitting on the couch next to the others, came up to Adam.</p><br><p>"Oh, is this your Operator? Your name is Silvana isn't it?" Kogen asked casually.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah... you're right. My Operator is here with me right now, where is your Operator? You have one just like me, don't you?"</p><br><p>Kogen shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"She's minding her own business. I don't need her help right now. I'm at my house, the whole ninth wing is my home."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes grew deeper.</p><br><p>"Hmm... That's a strange answer. You're not wrong, you're in charge here, but isn't the entire Citadel, is home to every inhabitant?"</p><br><p>In response, Kogen only smirked, leaned his head on the back of the sofa, and looked up. Experience exclusive tales on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>His unusual turquoise hair hung down, and his eyes shone brightly on the dark background.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the platform on which Adam and the others had arrived came into motion again. It quickly lowered and just as quickly rose, revealing the tall silhouette of someone who came here uninvited.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Kogen blinked a few times and turned his head at a strange angle, "What are you doing here?"</p><br><p>Following Kogen, the others turned around to greet the mysterious guest.</p><br><p>It was a middle-aged man, with light stubble, sharp facial features, and crimson eyes as intense as rare rubies.</p><br><p>His crimson hair was thick and fairly long, neatly slicked back, obviously with a lot of gel or wax.</p><br><p>The few wrinkles on his forehead did not make him look old, but gave him seriousness and a certain charm, showing that he didn't walk on this earth for the first day.</p><br><p>"Good afternoon, though... should I rather say good night? It's quite late and the children are still awake." The man smiled sweetly, his gaze traveling over Adam and Silvana, then over the others. The only one he didn't glance at was Gladius.</p><br><p>The man was dressed in a stylish black pinstripe suit, underneath the suit was a tight vest and a dark red shirt. He had a bowler hat on his head, and his strict leather boots glistened under the light.</p><br><p>In his hands was a long cane with a platinum tip and a short bone handle.</p><br><p>His jacket was worn loosely, hanging off his shoulders, the empty sleeves swaying slightly with every step he took, the long bottom edge fluttering in unison.</p><br><p>"Hm? Who is that...?" Adam asked with slight curiosity in his voice.</p><br><p>From the fact that the man had the same hair and eye color, Adam already knew that this was a high nobleman, one of the Twelve Branches.</p><br><p>Gladius grinned widely as he and the man exchanged glances like old acquaintances.</p><br><p>"This is Erik Wurhen, and... given the difficult situation in the Wurhen Family at the moment, he is now the most important person in this great family. At least... the most powerful, isn't he?" Gladius's smirk became more insidious.</p><br><p>Erik nodded deeply and looked at Kogen.</p><br><p>"Kid, aren't you happy to see me? Why don't you invite me to sit on this spacious couch like everyone else?" Erik said mockingly, though there was no malice in his voice or anything to hint at his hostility.</p><br><p>In response, Kogen only waved his hand nonchalantly and turned around, directing his gaze toward the panoramic window again.</p><br><p>"Pffft, just come in. You would still do it without my permission. I guess I should have stricter guest control, everyone comes in here like it's their home!" Kogen shook his head with a heavy sigh before throwing one leg over the other.</p><br><p>However... Erik didn't take a seat on the couch, instead, he headed further standing by the window, a few meters away from Adam and Silvana.</p><br><p>"Gladius, when I received the invitation from you in the purple room, I was at the bar, smoking a cigar and drinking an excellent whiskey. You completely changed all my plans." Erik said in a cold voice, holding tightly to his cane and looking forward.</p><br><p>In response, Gladius only shrugged carelessly.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry, I just couldn't miss an event like this. I hope you don't take offense?"</p><br><p>Then, Erik slowly turned around, smiling broadly, in his gaze was visible thirst and his patience was practically running out.</p><br><p>"Of course not... I just want to know. When can I place my bet? I can't wait to see the odds."</p><br><p>Gladius smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"Well, as soon as the Marzo Family picks their fighter and announces it. I'm sure they're doing it right now."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment. He was just as curious about this as Erik was.</p>
