            <h4>Chapter 1328: Dark Bear</h4><br><p>Adam spent the next week training with Narica and trying to calm her down after what he had done earlier.
</p><br><p>Gradually, he succeeded, and Narica even became softer toward him, but he encountered the problem from the first day again.
</p><br><p>"Stop," Adam said calmly when Narica’s fist stopped right in front of his face. The wind blew his hair back, but the blow did not land.
</p><br><p>Narica raised an eyebrow. "Hmm? What’s the matter?"
</p><br><p>"It’s useless, isn’t it?" He waved his hand. "We haven’t made any progress in the last few days. Well, more accurately, I haven’t been able to make any progress. Only 40% is all we’ve achieved, and I think that’s thanks to the momentum left over from our fight a week ago."
</p><br><p>For a moment, Narica frowned, remembering what Adam had done, then she nodded weakly.
</p><br><p>"I have to admit you’re right. Your progress hasn’t just slowed down, it’s practically stopped. I would advise you to return to methodically merging threads, but I know you won’t. You have too little patience."
</p><br><p>Adam shrugged. "Let’s call Norax, then. We need another way."
</p><br><p>In response, Narica glanced up.
</p><br><p>"I think sir heard us."
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>With a tremor, a portal of darkness appeared to the side, from which Norax emerged, holding a gamepad in one hand. He wasn’t following them, but even through multiple floors and thick walls, he could hear what they were talking about if he focused on the task.
</p><br><p>"You know, you should stick to one plan and not change it constantly." Norax glanced at Adam.
</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow. "That’s what I want to do. I want to fight at the edge to make the Energy Axis move faster. My training with Narica has simply lost its effectiveness over time."
</p><br><p>Norax turned to Narica, then to Adam, and finished with a deep nod.
</p><br><p>"I see. Well, in that case, I’ll be back soon. Don’t go anywhere."
</p><br><br><p>Darkness engulfed Norax as an awkward silence hung between Narica and Adam. They didn’t know where Norax had gone.
</p><br><p>"Adam, I want to ask you something," Narica began. "What are you planning to do next? I understand you didn’t expect to have to stay at the Forgotten Mills for so long."
</p><br><p>"Well, it’s all relative. This is the first time I’ve had to travel to any territory, but you’re right, I thought that after the String Duel it would all be over and I would return to the Citadel. The usual stuff and all that."
</p><br><p>Narica nodded weakly.
</p><br><p>’It seems he doesn’t know yet that Mr. Norax has plans for him. However, despite his behavior and recklessness, I can’t say he’s stupid. He must understand that someone like Mr. Norax or even me wouldn’t help him for no reason. Even if not Adam, his Operator must have suspected something.’
</p><br><br><p>With a tremor, a mass of darkness appeared in the center of the underground level of the mill, from which two silhouettes immediately emerged.
</p><br><p>There was no longer a gamepad in Norax’s hand, but a cup of coffee, and next to him was Misty in her black clothes and wide dress.
</p><br><p>"Oh, Misty, long time no see!" Adam waved his hand.
</p><br><p>She nodded and stepped forward as a long, dark umbrella appeared in her hands, covered with several straps.
</p><br><p>Without warning, she pointed the umbrella at Adam as his eyes widened.
</p><br><br><p>A dark ray shot out of the umbrella, causing Adam to jerk his head to let the projectile pass over his shoulder.
</p><br><p>Misty didn’t stop there. She continued to shoot at Adam without saying a word, treating him like a target at a shooting range.
</p><br><p>She didn’t let Adam catch his breath for a moment. He didn’t even have time to ask what was going on.
</p><br><br><p>When Adam reached the wall and bounced away from the devastating explosion, Misty finally stopped, placing her umbrella on the floor.
</p><br><p>"Hmm... Boss, do you want me to train him?"
</p><br><p>Norax took a sip of coffee, staring intently at Adam. "Yeah, something like that. The idea is to push him to his limits and thus force his Energy Axis to rebuild at an accelerated pace."
</p><br><p>"I see, that’s just like you. How did he agree to that?"
</p><br><p>"Agh? What do you mean?" Norax said casually. "It was his decision. He said that fighting Narica wasn’t effective anymore, so I brought you here. Are you going to take on this job or not?"
</p><br><p>In response, Misty approached Adam and examined him from all sides, as if he were an exhibit in a museum.
</p><br><p>"Well, well. About 40-50% of your true power, right?"
</p><br><p>She touched her chin thoughtfully, then turned away with disdain.
</p><br><p>"Nah, you’re too weak. I’ll just accidentally kill you at some point. I don’t think the boss will be happy about that."
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened in indignation.
</p><br><p>"W-What? What do you mean, I’m too weak? I’ve already regained some of my strength in a week and sparred dozens of times against Narica!"
</p><br><p>Misty’s unusual eyes stared at him, making him doubt his own words.
</p><br><p>"Are you sure about that? Because I can just do this."
</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could comprehend it, Misty’s fingertips touched his wrist.
</p><br><br><p>This movement was unlike the attacks Adam was used to, but he soon realized that it was a mistake to think so.
</p><br><br><p>A strange force forced him to the ground as if gravity had increased several times over in that spot.
</p><br><p>Adam tried to get up from the ground and managed to do so, albeit with great difficulty.
</p><br><p>With her head held high, Misty stepped aside, not interfering with him.
</p><br><p>"Well, just because I’m not fighting you doesn’t mean I’ll refuse my boss’s request." She turned, pointing her umbrella at Adam. "I’ll take care of your training, but you won’t be fighting me."
</p><br><p>"What does that mean?" Adam muttered.
</p><br><p>In response, Misty tapped her umbrella on the ground, and a mass of darkness appeared next to her, quickly taking the form of a massive teddy bear with red claws and purple eyes.
</p><br><p>"Against him." Misty pointed seriously at the giant teddy bear.</p>
