            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1374: Two Warriors and Two Needles</strong></p><br><br><p>Blood continued to flow down the white needle of the Silver Weaver, because even though Adam had finally remembered his ability, the wound he had received was more than real.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes were still closed as his body tried to conserve as much strength as possible. He needed help as soon as possible, some kind of healing ability or something like that.</p><br><p>The only reason Adam was still breathing and alive was the strength of his body and the fact that the Silver Weaver had not yet pulled his needle out of Adam’s heart. Otherwise, Adam would have already drowned in his own blood.</p><br><p>Only muffled gasps came from Adam when the Silver Weaver looked up.</p><br><p>“Operator. I know you want to heal him, but don’t you dare do it,” the Silver Weaver said menacingly.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Several spectral fragments appeared to the right of Adam like fairies. Silvana was still unable to take her full form after the Silver Weaver destroyed it.</p><br><p>“What are you talking about?! Adam will die soon! His heart is beating slower and slower.”</p><br><p>“Yeah, I can see that.” The Silver Weaver nodded slightly. “But what about you? You want to take on his wound and heal him that way, don’t you?”</p><br><br><p>Silvana had no answer, because that was exactly her plan.</p><br><p>“And? What do you think will happen in that case? You’re not a Phantom, you’re his Operator. You don’t have those instincts, that strong body, and that much energy, as well as a strong will to live. You’ll just die without a heart in a matter of seconds.”</p><br><p>“T-Then… What should I do? Watch Adam die?” Silvana shuddered.</p><br><p>Obviously, she was not going to accept such a scenario.</p><br><p>“No. You have another ability. Let Adam fight by filling his body with a large amount of energy. That will be enough for him to hold on for a while.”</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>“If he can achieve what he wants during this period, I’ll take care of the rest.”</p><br><p>“What… What if he can’t do it? What if he fails?”</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver looked at her slowly.</p><br><p>“Well, in that case, he will die. As I said, the same rules apply here as always. You either fight and win, or you lose and die.</p><br><br><p>“The choice is yours, Miss Operator. Either you save Adam’s life at the cost of your own, or you let him fight for both of your lives. This is your call.”</p><br><p>Although Silvana was always the one who handled the paperwork, official business, and took orders, it was Adam who made the truly important decisions on the battlefield.</p><br><p>Now, the task fell to her, and her time was limited.</p><br><p>“I’ll do as you say.”</p><br><br><p>“But not because I trust you, but because I believe in Adam!”</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver nodded deeply.</p><br><br><p>Silvana disappeared, and at the same moment, a bright light burst from Adam’s heart.</p><br><p>Sure, this ability couldn’t heal Adam’s wound, but the massive flow of energy would allow Adam to temporarily fight at the peak of his strength.</p><br><p>It was a risky move, and Silvana trusted the Silver Weaver, but Adam would be able to fight, and that was the most important thing.</p><br><br><p>The Silver Weaver pulled his needle out of Adam’s heart as he took a few steps back.</p><br><p>Streams of energy ran through Adam’s body, preventing blood from gushing out of the wound in his heart.</p><br><p>Now, Silvana was doing something similar to what Norax had done to heal Ureyn after their battle, but at a much lower and weaker level.</p><br><p>“Can you hear me?” The Silver Weaver asked as Adam’s fingertips twitched.</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam opened his eyes as the first needle appeared in his hand with a bright light, its wide blade ready to cut its way to victory.</p><br><p>“Yes…” Adam croaked in a low voice. “I don’t have much time. But don’t worry, I won’t need too much to defeat you.”</p><br><p>When Adam absorbed the Connected Heart, the main part went to his Branch Order, so now was the moment when he would use that power to defeat his first monster. Once again.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>White streams of energy swirled around Adam as several golden streams headed toward his needle, running along the blade and forming a line in the middle with a flash as bright as the sun at its center.</p><br><p>This was not only an enhancement for the needle, the golden energy ran through his wrist and forearm like threads, connecting with his white energy. Thus, making him significantly stronger than even when he used the fifth ring of his Nexus.</p><br><p>Sure, this power had a price, but now Adam had nothing to risk. He had already put everything he had on the line to win.</p><br><p>“Good.” The Silver Weaver took a fighting stance. “Show me what you’re capable of. If I don’t see your desire, you will die here—on an unknown island in the illusion of your own mind.”</p><br><br><p>Adam shook his head, causing the Silver Weaver to look puzzled.</p><br><p>“You are not an illusion. You are my past, my present, and now also my future. This is the way.”</p><br><p>Adam lunged forward, landing right in front of the Silver Weaver, who was not ready for the revelation but was expecting Adam’s attack.</p><br><br><p>The white and silver needles collided with each other, causing a cascade of sparks and a shockwave that swept the sand aside.</p><br><p>Time and time again, their needles collided, leaving only the clang of their clashes in the darkness, with sparks flying before their eyes.</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver remained calm, seeing every one of Adam’s movements, and even when Adam summoned the second needle, nothing changed significantly.</p><br><p>But he couldn’t help but notice the depth in Adam’s eyes and how his attacks were becoming heavier and faster.</p><br><p>‘Great, he’s close. Just a little more. I’ve done most of the work, Adam… The rest is up to you. Will you show me your last trump card and move on in your evolution, or will you simply fail?’</p>
