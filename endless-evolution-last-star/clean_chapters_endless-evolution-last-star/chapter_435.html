            <br><p>"What would happen if we switched places? Hah, you'd be a terrible Operator!" Silvana said confidently with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><br><p>Adam got a confused look on his face. He hadn't expected that the first thing Silvana would say after a long pause would be this.</p><br><p>"But... That goes for me too. I don't know what kind of Phantom I would be, you should be the judge here, you have much more experience in that. However, I don't think I could do as good as you, especially in such a short time."</p><br><p>Then, Silvana walked over to Adam and put a hand on his shoulder.</p><br><p>"You shouldn't think about things that will never happen. I will always be your Operator, and you will forever be my Phantom."</p><br><p>Silvana said confidently, then the corners of her lips lifted, forming a sly smirk, she thought about Adam's last words.</p><br><p>"However, I won't hide that the idea of switching roles is quite interesting. Louis and Alexia look good together, but... I'm not as devious as Louis and you're not as crazy and reckless as Alexia, we're more laid back."</p><br><p>Adam smirked, tilting his head.</p><br><p>"When Alexia and I defended Bastion Radon, then we woke up in the same room, you and Louis were already waiting for us."</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>"Tell me honestly. You were jealous of Alexia that Louis honored her every request. I'm not asking you as an Operator, here you have more in common with Louis than Alexia, but as a woman."</p><br><p>Silvana bit down on her pinky finger and looked at Adam with a strange look as if she had thought about it many times.</p><br><p>"Yes, just yes. But, I don't think it has anything to do with them being Operator and Phantom. It's just a different kind of relationship."</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a slight smile.</p><br><p>Then, he stepped forward and opened the bag with the burgers.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Didn't you say you weren't hungry?"</p><br><p>Adam shrugged, pulling the burgers out of the bag.</p><br><p>Read the latest on empire</p><br><p>"Never mind. I just got the urge to try something." Adam calmly replied before placing the three burgers next to each other.</p><br><p>Then, he pointed to the burgers and with a slight smile on his face said: "Go ahead, how about you pick one burger for yourself and one for me?"</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide for a moment, a satisfied smile appearing on her face.</p><br><p>"Sure, but be careful. Power can corrupt anyone."</p><br><p>"It's only burgers, after all." Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Yeah, I'm kidding, but everything always starts from small." Silvana nodded before glancing at the burgers, mulling over Adam's words.</p><br><br><br><p>The Redcore Wolf and the Shadow of the Woods slowly stepped forward, intending to attack Glara as soon as they got close enough.</p><br><p>Glara gulped as she turned to Gladius in a panic. Instinctively she knew that it would be no problem for him to handle these monsters. Sure, she didn't know anything about how strong Gladius was, but it was simple logic considering what position he held in this place.</p><br><p>"Why are you standing there, aren't you going to help me?! Obviously, the experiment didn't go as intended!" Glara exclaimed, staring at Gladius, hope in her eyes that he would save her.</p><br><br><p>Gladius simply shook his head.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry dear, but if I start fighting them seriously, I'll just destroy their genes, as well as yours. You'll pass out before you even realize anything has happened."</p><br><p>Glara was confused, she didn't quite understand what Gladius was talking about.</p><br><p>Sure, he didn't need to use his full power, as he was idle for another reason - it wasn't up to him to deal with the monsters.</p><br><p>"We have to intervene, right?" Sano asked, casting an unsure look at Aiden.</p><br><p>Aiden nodded, he continued to watch Glara's condition through the glass crystal of the Spark Seeker.</p><br><p>"Yes, but don't use amplifiers, your powers should be enough to deal with two White Threat monsters. Now, she can't become a Naturalborn Phantom, but she still has a chance to become the Artificial One, she just needs to kill Redcore Wolf and absorb his genes."</p><br><p>Aiden gave the order with a slight wave of his hand.</p><br><p>Natta and Sano looked at each other and nodded deeply. Even though they used to be military, they were still ordinary people, not Phantoms.</p><br><p>However, thanks to the inventions of one of the free scientists, now Natta and Sano were not afraid to fight against Redcore Wolf and Shadow, along with Glara.</p><br><br><p>They opened the large black cases that they had brought here earlier when Glara started fighting against Redcore Wolf.</p><br><p>Aiden knew that no matter how prepared and careful they were, things could always go wrong, there were backup plans for such cases.</p><br><p>Natta and Sano were that backup plan.</p><br><p>In black cases lay the exoskeletons. They were vastly different from the very first version the military received a few months ago. It was still the 'Andromeda' exoskeleton but with the codename - M03.</p><br><p>They were stronger, gave the military more strength, lasted much longer, and had several modes for different situations.</p><br><p>Two or three experienced military men in such an exoskeleton could defeat a regular White Threat Level monster.</p><br><p>But... Sano and Natto were far superior to experienced military personnel on the skill side, otherwise Aiden wouldn't have let them work for him.</p><br><p>In just a few seconds, Sano and Natto put on their exoskeletons before dipping down to the black cases again and pulling out two pairs of combat gloves. These were their False Nexuses.</p><br><p>They had minor differences.</p><br><p>Sano's gloves were slightly larger and heavier, while Natta's ones were longer and thinner.</p><br><p>"What's the mission?"</p><br><p>Sano asked, using the last few seconds to stretch out.</p><br><p>Aiden pointed at Shadow of the Woods.</p><br><p>"Kill him and wound Redcore Wolf, your genes will no longer allow Glara to become a Naturalborn Phantom anyway."</p><br><br><p>"How much time do we have?"</p><br><p>Aiden glanced at Glara, whose eyes were full of fear of approaching death.</p><br><p>"A minute and a half. Try to manage in eighty seconds."</p><br><p>Aiden said slowly, continuing to observe her condition.</p><br><br><p>Sano replied before they both jumped off, acting confident and in sync like a duo that had gone through many fights along the way.</p>
