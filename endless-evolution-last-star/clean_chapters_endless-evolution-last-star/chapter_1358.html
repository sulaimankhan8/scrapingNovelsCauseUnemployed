            <h4>Chapter 1358: Red Chamber in the Sky</h4><br><br><p>With a light push, Adam inserted the amber orb directly into the platform as a bright light ran along the lines along the edges.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The platform trembled, alarming Adam. He understood that the platform was supposed to pave his way to the next trial, but unlike the elevator, he had no understanding of how it worked.
</p><br><p>Moreover, given his previous experience, he didn’t know where he would go next, up or down.
</p><br><p>But... before leaving the arena, he wanted to get something else.
</p><br><br><p>All the blood absorbed into the amber orb flowed along a separate, empty line from a socket hidden from view.
</p><br><br><p>With a light click, the socket opened as a dark fragment floated in front of Adam, looking very similar to the first one.
</p><br><p>"Hah, you were right." He turned to Silvana, staring at the fragment. "The main condition has always been victory, right? That’s all it takes to get the grand prize!"
</p><br><p>Silvana didn’t answer, she just stared intently at the dark fragment through Adam’s vision.
</p><br><p>Deep down, she was worried about what this might mean. After all, she was now completely sure that these fragments only appeared for the contenders who chose the amber crystal at the very beginning as their difficulty level.
</p><br><p>’First, the dagger to get the gargoyle’s fang, and now the orb of the golem. Sure, Adam didn’t find a special item on this trial that would help him win, he did it on his own, but could the color of this orb really be a coincidence?’
</p><br><p>She looked at the amber orb one last time before turning her gaze to the second dark fragment.
</p><br><br><p>With a slight tremor, she appeared next to him to examine the fragment from all sides.
</p><br><p>"Hmm, on the last fragment we have either claws or fangs, right?" She asked.
</p><br><p>Adam nodded and pulled out the first fragment. After turning them several times, he was able to fit them together perfectly so that there were no gaps.
</p><br><p>"Fangs, claws, and what is this...?" He raised an eyebrow, looking at the sharp lines sloping to the sides like a wave. Still, he could barely see the lines, so it was very difficult to understand anything.
</p><br><p>Silvana nodded. "I think it’s fur, something like that. Apparently, we only have one fragment left to find."
</p><br><p>"Yeah..." Adam nodded, looking at the gap.
</p><br><p>Maybe they were wrong and there were more fragments, but if the next fragment was the same size, it would definitely be the last one.
</p><br><p>"Okay, I passed the second trial and found the fragment. Now, what? Surely this platform isn’t here to send me to..."
</p><br><p>Before Adam could finish, a ray of light fell on him as the platform started moving, quickly rising above the ground.
</p><br><br><p>Surprised, he stumbled but managed to keep his balance so as not to fall off the edge.
</p><br><p>All this time, the platform was also an elevator, and this time, Adam was going up. However, he was not moving along the main channel. He had no idea where he was going.
</p><br><p>"What the hell? Where are we going?" Adam exclaimed, seeing only blue sky and slowly floating clouds above him.
</p><br><p>If he had been anywhere else, it wouldn’t have caused him to panic, but he understood that this sky was an illusion, which meant that in a few seconds, he would crash right into a wall.
</p><br><p>Adam reached out his hand, preparing to summon the Dual Demon Sword, electric discharges already running through his eyes.
</p><br><br><p>At the same time, with a loud crash, two stone slabs began to move, opening a passage upward right in the middle of the sky.
</p><br><p>For a moment, darkness fell, but the platform was still moving fast, and Adam could feel it.
</p><br><p>Then, a red light fell on him, quite dim at first but gradually becoming brighter, allowing him to see normally again.
</p><br><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened as he gasped in surprise.
</p><br><p>"What are you doing here!"
</p><br><p>He stared at Mona, who was standing in front of him near the edge of the platform. Despite everything that had happened, she wore the same calm expression as before, while the red light changed with the shadows falling on her face.
</p><br><p>"What do you mean? I’m going to take you to the next trial, just like I did before. However, we’ll make a short stop first."
</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow, puzzled.
</p><br><br><p>As if following her words, the platform stopped abruptly, causing Adam to jump from the momentum.
</p><br><p>Mona pointed to the passage ahead, lit by red torches, and walked forward.
</p><br><br><p>Adam tilted his head, looked up to see only darkness, and shrugged.
</p><br><p>The White Spire was a mysterious and dangerous place, but at least everything worked according to the rules here, and he knew that Mona was just doing her job.
</p><br><p>Adam didn’t know what to expect when he entered the chamber, but in the middle of the hall, he saw a large stone tub carved out of the ground. A bright red liquid was bubbling vigorously, its aroma let Adam know that it wasn’t blood, but something else — herbs.
</p><br><p>"What is this place?"
</p><br><p>Mona pointed to the tub.
</p><br><p>"You’re injured, aren’t you? Maybe the Crystal Golem and imps didn’t hurt you directly, but to win this victory, you put your body under serious pressure. Here, you’ll be able to recover fairly quickly."
</p><br><p>Adam stepped forward, stopping at the edge to dip his fingers into the red water. From this distance, the scent became even more pleasant.
</p><br><p>"It’s a mixture of water, energy, and several herbs that grow at the White Spire. For a K4-Phantom like you, this should be enough."
</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam smiled and, with a wave of his hand, threw off all his clothes before jumping straight into the tub like a child.
</p><br><p>Mona’s eyebrow twitched slightly, but she didn’t react to it.
</p><br><p>’Tsk. Was it really that hard to ask me to turn away?’ She complained inwardly.
</p><br><p>"Agh..." Adam sighed deeply, feeling the warmth. "Hah, I already feel better. It seems I made a big mistake by refusing to rest after the first trial."
</p><br><p>For a while, Mona just watched him until, at one point, she looked at him intently.
</p><br><p>"You plan to pass all the trials and reach the top, right?" She asked.
</p><br><br><br><p>"Good. Then that will be your answer. You see, my lady, the Silver Beacon wants you to give up."
</p><br><p>A glint flashed across Adam’s eyes.
</p><br><p>"What an interesting suggestion... too bad it’s extremely foolish."</p>
