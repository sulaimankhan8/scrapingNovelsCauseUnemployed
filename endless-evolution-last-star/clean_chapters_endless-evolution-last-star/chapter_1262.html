            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1262: The Beast</strong></p><br><p>Before leaving the dark forest and heading to the Glass Bridge, Garrah told Adam everything he knew.</p><br><p>Mostly, it was about various details, such as guards, fees, restrictions, and so on.</p><br><p>However, Garrah’s biggest concern was the beast, or more precisely, the Crystal Beast of the Glass Bridge.</p><br><p>Now, standing in the middle of the seal, in front of the mysterious monster, with shivers running down his body, Adam remembered what Garrah had said. Perhaps his survival at this moment depended on these recent memories, on their conversation.</p><br><p>“You’d better not irritate the guards when you get to the bridge,” Garrah said in the middle of the feast celebrating the victory over the Red Bloom. “Otherwise, the beast may appear, and then you’ll have real problems, possibly fatal ones.”</p><br><p>“The beast?” Adam gave him a questioning look.</p><br><p>Garrah nodded deeply, his gaze dark.</p><br><p>“Yes. I hope you don’t have to face it. I’m afraid you won’t be able to defeat this monster. It is truly a High Elder, and if the beast wanted to, it could destroy the dark forest, the Red Bloom, me, and all the monsters in just a few attacks. It would be easy for it.”</p><br><p>Adam’s expression changed. The smile disappeared, contrasting with the joyful monsters in the background.</p><br><p>“I understand that even among the High Elders, he is above the norm, right?”</p><br><p>“Indeed. I’m not trying to scare you, Adam. Moreover, I’m sure that won’t happen. You’ll be able to pass the guards’ inspection and reach the Forgotten Mills.”</p><br><p>Adam frowned. “But what if this beast does show up? If he’s really as strong as you say, then I won’t be able to run away or hide, it’ll be impossible for someone like me.”</p><br><p>“Well…” Garrah sighed heavily. “In that case, you’ll have to go through the trials.”</p><br><br><br><p>The last words echoed in Adam’s mind like a bell, and the curious smirk of the Crystal Beast seemed to confirm his fears.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Kara and Toa were just as shocked as Adam. No, perhaps they expected the appearance of the Crystal Beast even less, which was evident from the horror on their faces.</p><br><p>They did not yet understand that the reason was the results of Adam’s test, due to the energy hidden in his body.</p><br><p>Kara and Toa, as the main guards who always watched over those who crossed the Glass Bridge, decided that they had done something wrong.</p><br><p>More than anything else in this life, they feared failing before the Crystal Beast and incurring his wrath.</p><br><p>If Kara and Toa were the guards of the Glass Bridge, then the Crystal Beast was its warden. If it was his will, he could get rid of them and find new guards.</p><br><p>This had never happened before, but they knew what their warden was capable of and feared that because of Adam Vinter’s unusual status, they had made a mistake.</p><br><br><p>Kara and Toa exclaimed simultaneously before collapsing to the ground. Their foreheads hit the surface, leaving them with none of the pride or cunning they had shown toward Adam.</p><br><p>Well, they couldn’t be blamed for that. The aura of the Crystal Beast alone was enough to make their hearts beat in panic.</p><br><p>Then, Adam pointed out one simple thing: the difference between Elders and High Elders was enormous. This gap was much greater than that between a Lesser Elder and an Elder.</p><br><p>However, at the K4-Level, the situation was similar. Even though Adam had already created the First Grand Star, if he fought someone like Orel, Risha’s brother, he would lose in less than a minute.</p><br><p>Monsters, even at such a high level, were more cruel than humans, so Kara and Toa were right to take such a stance immediately, or at least they thought so.</p><br><br><p>Without Kara and Toa’s energy, the seal shattered, leaving Adam alone in the middle of the great bridge in front of its warden.</p><br><p>Silvana, watching from the Citadel, bit her lip until it bled. She didn’t dare appear in her spectral form so as not to provoke the Crystal Beast.</p><br><p>Despite the situation, Adam and Silvana did not allow themselves to panic. From their conversation with Garrah, they knew that Adam would not have to fight the Crystal Beast, at least if Adam did everything right.</p><br><br><p>The Crystal Beast began to move, taking a step forward. His thick, white fur, like fresh snow, swayed along with his heavy frame. A glint ran across his sharp, short claws while his blue eyes, wise and deep like a human’s, studied Adam, contrasting sharply with his curious, childlike grin.</p><br><p>However, his long, sharp claws showed that if necessary, he could tear any enemy to pieces.</p><br><p>Kara and Toa flinched, not daring to raise their heads.</p><br><p>“You…” the Crystal Beast’s voice rang out, low and surprisingly lively. “What is your name… young man?”</p><br><p>Adam gulped. He had no choice but to answer, honestly and quickly.</p><br><p>“Adam Vinter, that is my name!”</p><br><p>“Hmm…” the Crystal Beast scratched its chin thoughtfully, nodding from time to time. “I think I’ve heard your name before… Let me guess, threads and needles, is that right?”</p><br><br><p>Then, his gaze fell on Kara and Toa, who were afraid to move.</p><br><p>“You, stop embarrassing me in front of our guest… Stop acting like worms, you guardians of this bridge! Stand up straight!”</p><br><p>There were no questions or protests from them. Instead, they jumped up as if on springs and stood at attention like soldiers.</p><br><br><p>The Crystal Beast chuckled. “Hah, these two, they’re so funny, aren’t they?”</p><br><p>Adam scratched his cheek, the situation becoming awkward.</p><br><p>“I guess… I mean, considering how strong you are, I’d be afraid to work for you, too.”</p><br><p>Kara and Toa’s eyes darted to Adam, piercing him with unprecedented hatred, as if he had committed the most terrible sin against them.</p><br><p>“Human!” Kara exclaimed.</p><br><p>“You dare not address the warden so disrespectfully!” Toa supported her as their auras grew stronger.</p><br><p>They were ready to attack him right then and there, but…</p><br><br><p>The Crystal Beast’s laughter, which echoed throughout the Glass Bridge, stopped them. It was not the reaction they had expected.</p><br><p>“Adam,” the Crystal Beast said. “Since I know your name, it would be fair for me to do the same, wouldn’t it?”</p><br><p>Adam nodded cautiously. After everything that had happened, he wasn’t sure what the right answer was.</p><br><p>The Crystal Beast pointed to its chest.</p><br><p>“Targon, the Crystal Beast. That is my name. I know you don’t have a title yet, but I would like to know someone else’s name.”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam gave him a questioning look.</p><br><p>With a sharp gleam in his eyes, Targon pointed to a spot to Adam’s right.</p><br><p>“Your Operator, I would like to see her too. Is she human or a monster?”</p><br><p>Confusion covered Adam’s face.</p><br><p>Up until this point, Targon had been acting rather strangely, or rather unpredictably, but… this question sounded illogical to Adam at its root.</p><br><p>‘W-What? What is he talking about? What does human or monster mean?’</p><br><p>If Gladius were in Adam’s place, he would have had a different answer to this question, that’s for sure.</p><br><p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p><br><p>Targon scratched the back of his head, realizing too late that this was not a question K4-Phantom was prepared to answer.</p><br><p>“I see… right, I completely forgot. It’s been a long time since we’ve had such an interesting Phantom here. In any case, I’d like to meet your Operator.”</p><br><p>At the same moment, Silvana appeared next to Adam.</p><br><p>Her arms were crossed over her chest as she looked fearlessly at Targon, or rather, she tried to look that way, although the nervous tapping of her fingers on her forearm betrayed her true emotions.</p><br><p>“What is your name, young lady?” Targon asked with a wave of his hand. It was curiosity and nothing more.</p><br><p>“Silvana, Silvana Desio.”</p><br><p>Targon smiled slyly as his eyes darted from Adam to Silvana.</p><br><p>“Oh, Silvana Desio, why not Silvana Vinter?”</p><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana’s stern facade crumbled as her cheeks flushed. Unlike Adam, who was puzzled, she understood what Targon was talking about in an instant.</p><br><p>“T-This… It’s too soon for us! We have a lot of problems ahead of us! The World Wipe and the huge beast on the bridge!” She exclaimed in embarrassment.</p><br><p>Kara and Toa’s faces paled. They would never have dared to speak to Targon like that.</p><br><p>“Hahahahaha! You two are perfect for each other! Hey, when you want to get married, come here! Kara, Toa, and I will host you and even invite the monsters from the forest. Hah, I hope Garrah, that old man, is still alive!”</p><br><p>Silvana’s face turned red as a tomato. She had thought about this stage of their relationship, but they were still too new a couple to seriously consider such things.</p><br><p>“Yes, he’s alive.” Adam’s calm voice rang out.</p><br><p>“Good.” Targon nodded.</p><br><p>Then, his gaze changed, becoming dark and deep.</p><br><p>“Alright, now down to business. I won’t let you pass unless I think you’re worthy.”</p><br><p>After these words, Targon stretched out his arm with a tightly clenched fist.</p><br><p>His broad, joyful smile returned.</p><br><p>“Go ahead, hit with all your strength. Show me what you’re capable of. Let’s call this the first trial!”</p>
