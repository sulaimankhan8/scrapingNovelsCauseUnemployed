            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1409: The best memories remain in the past</strong></p><br><p>It was obvious that Anelez had become the main favorite to fight Adam. However, it wasn’t just Adam who chose his opponent. The candidates also had the opportunity to understand what Adam was worth.</p><br><p>Anelez’s response was aimed precisely at this.</p><br><p>She, like everyone else here, knew that Adam had gone through many battles on his journey. It wasn’t so important for her to know the details of the most difficult one, but the answer to the same question he had asked her.</p><br><p>“My most difficult battle, yeah?” Adam tapped his chin. “I have an answer for you.”</p><br><p>The corners of his lips curved into a smirk.</p><br><p>“I wouldn’t want to go through my toughest battle again. However, not because I’m afraid I’ll lose. No, I’m sure I would win again.”</p><br><br><p>“Just… If that happened, my impressions of the toughest battle in my history would change significantly and would certainly become much worse. There’s no doubt about that. So, if I had that opportunity and I did it, I would just ruin my own memories.”</p><br><br><p>No one said anything, even the perpetually dissatisfied Erada stared at Adam with wide eyes. She certainly didn’t expect that kind of answer from him.</p><br><p>The only one who could decide whether this answer was worthy was Anelez.</p><br><p>“That’s an excellent answer, Mr. Adam,” she said. “Should I go back to the hallway, or is there anything else you want to ask me?”</p><br><p>“Yes. There’s one more question.” Adam’s eyes flashed. “Are you ready to fight me today?”</p><br><p>Anelez gulped as she nodded.</p><br><p>“Of course. That’s why I came here. I hope you understand that I will fight with all my strength. I don’t want to help you. My main goal is to become stronger and break through my barrier.”</p><br><p>“Hah, could I ask for anything more?”</p><br><p>Xander turned to Adam.</p><br><p>“So, is this our candidate? Will you and she go through the Rule of Blood?”</p><br><p>“Is there a problem with that?” Adam asked.</p><br><p>“No,” Xander shook his head. “Not at all. I think it will be an excellent fight. There’s just one thing left to decide.”</p><br><br><p>“The battlefield. I don’t think it would be appropriate to fight in one of the arenas. Izardo is a great city, but there are spacious areas around it where you two can let loose and not worry about anyone interfering.”</p><br><p>Adam shrugged confidently.</p><br><p>“The main thing is that there is enough space and no rules. Fighting in the arena was fun, I must admit, but banning abilities? That’s too harsh a restriction. Once was enough for me.”</p><br><p>Anelez nodded. “I agree. I may even know a suitable place. If you decide to consider it, of course…”</p><br><br><p>Even though Adam wanted to get stronger as quickly as possible, he wasn’t going to rush every moment of his life.</p><br><p>They didn’t rush into battle immediately after the fighters were decided. They spent some time considering all the options, came to a conclusion, and began preparations.</p><br><p>Xander helped Anelez, while Helasa gave Adam advice.</p><br><p>It might have seemed that he didn’t need advice, but Helasa was more experienced and knew more than he did about the Monster Hybrids.</p><br><p>After all, today, Adam had met all the Monster Hybrids that had ever existed in his life. Until that day, they had remained an unknown force to him.</p><br><br><p>Helasa placed her coffee cup on the table as her gaze settled on Adam.</p><br><p>“Don’t forget that, unlike monsters, who don’t have any special weapons until they become the Lords, the Hybrids have something similar to what you have, the Phantoms.”</p><br><p>“Yeah, I know, you’re talking about the Solar Form, right?” Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>Helasa nodded. “Exactly. You’ve never seen what it looks like, but I’m sure you have some kind of picture in your head. Just remember that it’s not only a Hybrid’s weapon, but its trump card. Once a Hybrid uses its Solar Form, it means the battle is entering its most serious stage.”</p><br><p>“Fighting a Hybrid…” Adam lingered as he looked at the ceiling. “They mainly rely on physical strength, don’t they?”</p><br><p>“Yes. However, Erada, Xander, and Anelez all have a range of abilities. You shouldn’t underestimate them. Especially that girl, Anelez.”</p><br><p>“Hmm? Did you notice something unusual about her?”</p><br><p>“No…” Helasa bit her lip. “That’s the problem. You and I know you don’t stand a chance against Xander, he’s not on your level. Erada is on the same level as you, but you can understand her whole personality in ten seconds of talking to her. Then, this girl… She is both confident and shy. Her aura is powerful, but her voice trembles with weakness when she recalls past battles.”</p><br><p>“Isn’t that a good thing?”</p><br><p>Helasa gasped. “Ah?”</p><br><p>“If she had that reaction to her past battles, then it must have been something special, right? Still, she’s alive and ready to fight on. That shows she’s stronger than she seems.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Helasa nodded.</p><br><p>“Maybe you’re right. In any case, be careful. It would be quite disappointing to spend so much time preparing, planning, and selecting a candidate only to lose in disgrace in the end.”</p><br><p>“Hey, I thought you were on my side. Don’t you believe in my victory?”</p><br><p>Helasa’s lips curled upward into a smirk.</p><br><p>“Well, you defeated one fighter in the arena with your bare fists and energy. Like many monsters, I’ve heard your name, but I don’t know the extent of your abilities. So, for me, this fight will be full of surprises.”</p><br><p>Adam looked westward, where the battlefield awaited him tonight, just a few hours away.</p><br><p>The silent expanse awaited him, as did Anelez, who was preparing for what might be the most important battle for her in the last few decades.</p><br><br><p>She grabbed the edges of the sink, looking at her reflection in the mirror.</p><br><p>‘Adam Vinter… the stellar phantom. If I defeat him, there will be no more obstacles on my way to the Lord Level. I have to do this. He came for victory, but I have the same goal.’</p>
