            <br><p>"Hey, I hope you're not waiting for me for too long?" Fromund smiled widely, waving his hand at the girl.</p><br><p>The girl flinched, his harsh voice brought her out of her thoughts, then she gave a happy smile.</p><br><p>"Fromund! You've finally made it! Ah, I was beginning to worry that something happened to you on the way!" The girl's eyes shone as she placed a palm on her chest.</p><br><p>In response, Fromund shrugged.</p><br><p>"Hah, unlike you I live very far from the First Ring and the ninth wing isn't the most convenient part of this place."</p><br><p>The girl nodded slowly, smiling awkwardly.</p><br><p>"Well, anyway." Fromund walked over to her, placing a hand on her shoulder, "It's good to see you, Arayna."</p><br><p>Before Arayna could reply, three small shadows came at her from different directions.</p><br><br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda exclaimed happily, hugging Arayna with joyful looks. Even though she was Fromund's Operator, she sometimes spent more time with them than Fromund.</p><br><p>"Oh, not so hard, I might fall!" Arayna exclaimed, trying to stay on her feet.</p><br><p>Tilda, the younger sister, looked up and down at Arayna.</p><br><p>Discover more content at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Arayna, brother is going to win, isn't he?"</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, speak your mind! You're the Operator, and you know who the other fighter is! I'm sure you've calculated it all out a long time ago!"</p><br><p>Liv looked at her silently with pleading eyes like a kitten's.</p><br><p>Arayna was confused, she didn't have an answer, she didn't want to deceive them, but she also couldn't ignore their request.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>A powerful rush of wind swept along the colosseum's walls, crashing down on them with great force.</p><br><p>The girls' hair fluttered as they squeezed their eyes shut to shield themselves from the dust. Fromund simply raised his hand, shielding himself with his palm.</p><br><p>Then, a tall silhouette in black clothes appeared beside them, a sly smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Young ladies, you should not ask such questions to your brother's Operator. If she tells you who will win, you will lose all interest and excitement for this fight." Gladius said politely, holding one hand behind his back.</p><br><p>Fromund cast a glance at him.</p><br><p>"Hm? Are you an employee of this arena?" Fromund asked, looking at Gladius's appearance.</p><br><p>Elva frowned, turning to Gladius.</p><br><p>"If I know my brother will win, then I don't need anything else. It is far better to know that he will triumph than to worry for a long time."</p><br><br><p>"Well, it may be the right attitude on your part, but that's the rule."</p><br><p>Then, Gladius looked at Fromund.</p><br><p>"What about your question... You could say that. At least I'm going to escort your sisters and the Operator to the spectator seats. You don't have to worry, those are some of the best seats, in Kogen Noukx's box."</p><br><p>Fromund's eyes went wide for a moment as he glanced up at the Moon Colosseum. He'd seen from afar how huge the structure was, he knew the view inside should be more spectacular and extensive.</p><br><br><p>Zarot, Nirosh, and Mariel approached them, giving Gladius irritated glances. They clearly weren't pleased that he was intruding again, but there was nothing they could do about it.</p><br><p>"Or you can go to the Marzo and Rouzet Families' boxes. They like great families have nice places too, but they don't have a personal one like Kogen, so there will be other members of their families there as well, not just you." Gladius calmly explained as if he was actually an employee of the colosseum.</p><br><p>Fromund thought for a while before nonchalantly waving his hand.</p><br><p>"Take them to the best seats. I want Arayna and my sisters to see my fight in all its glory."</p><br><p>Gladius smiled widely, his eyes heavily narrowed, almost closed.</p><br><br><p>Then, Gladius held out his hand towards the entrance, speaking to Arayna, Elva, Liv, and Tilda.</p><br><p>"Young ladies, please follow me."</p><br><p>Arayna cast an uncertain glance at Fromund, he nodded and she smiled slightly, about to follow Gladius.</p><br><p>"Good luck, I'm sure you'll win." Arayna glanced at his sisters, patting Tilda on the head, "You have someone to fight for."</p><br><p>Watching Arayna and his sisters depart towards the passageway, Fromund blinked a few times in confusion.</p><br><p>"Wait!" Fromund waved a hand to Gladius, "Where do I go? I take it I don't belong among the audience seats, right?"</p><br><p>Gladius stopped, looking at him over his shoulder, a sly smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Sure, don't worry, you'll figure it out soon enough."</p><br><br><p>Then, Zarot walked over to Fromund, placing his heavy hand on his shoulder, patting him slowly.</p><br><p>"I won't hide it, in any other situation I wouldn't even look in your direction, we live in different worlds. But..."</p><br><p>Zarot's gaze rose darker as he looked to the right half of the Moon Colosseum.</p><br><p>"We are on the same side now. We need your victory as much as you do. Do your job well and maybe this case will help you more than once in the future."</p><br><p>Mariel only smiled slightly, with a slight nod.</p><br><p>The last to go was Nirosh.</p><br><p>"Win. Fuck, I want you to destroy Adam Vinter just like he ruined my dream! Your victory will determine whether or not I get Osana De Rouzet as my wife. Do whatever is necessary or I swear you will regret it!" Nirosh frowned heavily, clenching his fist tightly.</p><br><p>Fromund pointed at Nirosh, glaring at Zarot.</p><br><p>"Hey, you would do well to teach your son how to properly encourage fighters, as this is a complete failure."</p><br><p>Nirosh took umbrage:</p><br><br><p>Fromund shook his head.</p><br><p>"Agh, though I am not familiar with her, I do not envy Osana De Rouzet. And, not only because a horrible, disgusting man like you wants to become her husband, but also because it's going to happen."</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Nirosh was baffled by Fromund's answer.</p><br><p>Fromund smiled confidently, stepping forward to meet the black raven who descended from the top of the Moon Colosseum.</p><br><p>"Because I'm not going to lose. Even if I'm sorry that you'll become Osana's husband and get what you don't deserve, I don't care."</p><br><p>Then, Fromund's eyes turned darker and his voice colder.</p><br><p>"I have my own goals and priorities that I value above all else."</p><br><br><p>A black raven surrounded him, landing on Fromund's right shoulder.</p><br><p>An amber eye with a double pupil met with Fromund's gaze, guiding the second fighter to his position.</p>
