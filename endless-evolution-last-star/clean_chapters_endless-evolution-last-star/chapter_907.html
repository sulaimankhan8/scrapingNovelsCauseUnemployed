            <br><br><p>With a rumble, Adam slammed into a slab of stone. Cracks ran along the edges as his body imprinted into the solid wall.</p><br><p>Reinz could continue his attack, he had everything he needed. However, he realized that this was not a mortal combat.</p><br><p>They were fighting to help each other master the Infusive Energy Control. Reinz was skeptical, if not for Adam's persistence he would've continued with his normal training.</p><br><p>But, for Reinz it was the most beneficial. A few clashes and painful moments and he was able to do it - the Infusive Energy Control affected his ability.</p><br><p>"Unbelievable..." Reinz gulped looking at his hands, "Hah... It worked."</p><br><p>Unlike Erik's scarlet blade, no lightning or flames came out of his gauntlets and boots, but small orbs of dense energy emerged on them. It was as if each gauntlet and boot had a core, increasing the efficiency of the energy.</p><br><p>As a result, it allowed Reinz to reach previously unattainable speeds.</p><br><p>'That's impressive, but...' he gulped, his legs trembling slightly, 'Mr. Erik didn't warn us to be afraid of recoil. Using the Infusive Energy Control isn't easy at all...'</p><br><p>Reinz had no problem maintaining orbs, but he realized that he had to think about his every move so that he wouldn't run out of energy in the middle of the fight.</p><br><p>Then, his eyes darted forward - to the cloud of dust behind which the silhouette lurked.</p><br><p>"Adam! Come on! I did it! Now it's your turn!" Reinz exclaimed with a sweep of his arm.</p><br><br><p>In a light step, Adam stepped out of the cloud of dust. A trickle of blood flowed from the corners of his mouth, a wide bloodstain soaked his clothes on the right side - the wound was far more serious than a simple bruise from a kick, yet his grip around the needle was as strong as ever.</p><br><p>"Gha..." Adam wheezed, a clot of blood flying out of his mouth, "That hurt... fucking hurt..."</p><br><p>Slowly, he turned to Reinz. His dark eyes scrutinized the changes made to Reinz's main ability.</p><br><p>"Cool... Hah, so you wanted to get faster, right?" he asked, a bitter smile on his face.</p><br><p>In response, Reinz nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yes, go ahead and attack!"</p><br><p>With flames in his eyes, Reinz assumed a fighting stance. Electric shocks ran through his body. There was no desire to win in him, what he wanted was to help Adam, just like he did before.</p><br><p>"I won't give in or you won't experience the dire need for a boost. Be careful and despite the pain think about what you need to win! That's my best advice!"</p><br><p>Adam grinned, directing his gaze downward.</p><br><p>'Just what I need, right?'</p><br><p>A multitude of thoughts filled Adam's mind.</p><br><p>Maybe he wanted to get faster? In that case, he could outrun Reinz again.</p><br><p>Maybe he needed strength? A few heavy needle strikes and Reinz would be lying on the ground.</p><br><p>Maybe it was finally time to think about defense? He saw Reinz's legs twitching from time to time.</p><br><p>"Hah..." Adam chuckled darkly, "Strength? Speed? Defense? Who the fuck needs that? Certainly not me..."</p><br><p>He shook his head, taking slow steps towards Reinz.</p><br><p>The electric shocks were getting stronger, but Reinz wasn't going to attack first. He waited patiently until Adam was in range for the clash.</p><br><p>If he was going to win tonight, he was going to do it in close combat.</p><br><br><p>After a few steps, Adam stopped in front of Reinz. One more step and his needle would have cut through Reinz's chest.</p><br><p>But, Reinz was in no hurry - Adam's needle was pointed downward.</p><br><p>"Reinz... do you know what my strongest ability is? Although, that's not a question... It's a statement. You've seen it."</p><br><p>Before Reinz could respond, Adam brought his hand up to attack - the tip of the needle was aimed at Reinz. It seemed Adam didn't want to cut, he wanted to pierce.</p><br><br><p>A stream of snow-white energy came out of Adam's body, billowing in all directions like a serene flame, therefore dangerous.</p><br><p>"Thread, needle, gravity, lightning, and more..." he muttered, energy flowing along his arm, "All of this is just my way of paving the path."</p><br><p>Reinz's eyes went wide, full of fear over the events at the Twilight Palace. His body jerked, his hands thrust forward, about to unleash a power of thunder on Adam.</p><br><p>But, it was too late.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward as his needle moved further straight towards Reinz's chest.</p><br><p>In a split second, Reinz realized that he didn't have time to counterattack, he was left with only one option--</p><br><p>'Block... I have to block his attack or I'm finished!'</p><br><p>Gritting his teeth, Reinz crossed his arms over his chest, the orbs on his gauntlets shuddering, releasing electrical discharges that acted as a shield.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the tip of the needle touched his wrist.</p><br><br><br><br><p>Instead of bright pain, speed attack, or thrust, there was only a light touch, as if that was enough for victory.</p><br><p>Seeing his reaction, Adam smiled weakly.</p><br><p>"Sorry, it seems I've won again."</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A faint shiver ran down the needle, traveling down Reinz's body - a reminder that it was already over.</p><br><p>Then, Adam's hand turned to shadow along with the bright, silver needle.</p><br><p>Faster than Reinz could have imagined it, the silver needle thrust into the same point three times, each time carrying an array of white energy, streaming down on Reinz.</p><br><br><p>Lightning gauntlets shattered into shards flying in front of Reinz's wide-open eyes. His pupils trembled, not in fear but in awe before Adam's ability.</p><br><p>Three snow-white rings like pulses moved away from the point of strike. Then, the impact slammed Reinz's body into the wall with such force that behind a layer of dust his silhouette was lost.</p><br><p>Only a few drops of blood fell on Adam's face, rapidly losing color, becoming pale and exhausted.</p><br><br><p>"Again!" Julia exclaimed sternly looking at Silvana and Chloe who were struggling to push off.</p><br><p>Julia sat at the table, relaxedly sipping her coffee.</p><br><p>Then, her eye darted to the side - the cup shook as if in a major earthquake, black liquid spilling out of the rims.</p><br><p>'What the hell...?' she looked down, 'The arena is a lot of floors down... What are those two idiots doing? No... Which one of them did it?'</p>
