            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1115: Tarnished Lands</strong></p><br><p>“The Tarnished Lands…?” Adam asked, puzzled.</p><br><p>Neither he nor Silvana had ever heard of this region, although they hadn’t had the opportunity to.</p><br><p>The Dark Shore, like the Tarnished Lands, was supposed to remain a secret to anyone who wasn’t prepared to survive the World Wipe.</p><br><p>If Phantom hadn’t reached K4-Level, there was no point in his knowing about these places. He wasn’t strong enough to survive there and fight the monsters that inhabited these places anyway.</p><br><p>But when Phantom reached the next level and learned the truth about their world, the situation changed.</p><br><p>Douglas nodded deeply in response to Adam’s surprise.</p><br><p>“Yes. Don’t forget what I said, Adam. Humans are inferior to monsters in every way, but we know how to adapt and use our resources to the maximum. It doesn’t matter that we can’t absorb energy, that we have problems with artifacts, and that we face many more obstacles.</p><br><p>“We always find a way to become stronger and explore new places so that humanity remains one of the two main forces in this world. The Tarnished Lands is another obstacle in your path now that you are a K4-Phantom.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded weakly as he stepped forward to stand next to Douglas. If they took another step, they would fall off the cliff, but that was not meant to happen.</p><br><p>“And? Who will I meet there?”</p><br><p>“Hah, isn’t it obvious? The Black Threat Monsters. Most of them will be F1, F2, and F3 monsters. Only in the farthest reaches or at the Dark Shore will you encounter quite a few F4 and F5 Black Threat Monsters.”</p><br><p>With a serious look, Adam turned to him, pointing to the Tarnished Lands.</p><br><p>“What about the Elders and the Lords? I know most of them are at the Dark Shore, but still. Considering that you’re only telling me about the Tarnished Lands now, it’s also a very dangerous area.”</p><br><p>Douglas crossed his arms over his chest.</p><br><p>“Sure, besides the Black Threat Level, there are also Elders and Lords in the Tarnished Lands. Well, the Elders are the same as the Black Threat Monsters, only they have gone through the Awakening. However, you shouldn’t worry about it too much.”</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, puzzled.</p><br><br><br><p>“Unlike the Dark Shore, where you can encounter Lords both on the outside and inside, at the borders and in the center, even beyond the gates, at the Tarnished Lands, things are a little different.</p><br><p>“The Tarnished Lands are not as dangerous as the Dark Shore. There are many more weaker monsters and far fewer stronger ones. The kind of battle you saw at the Dark Shore is not that rare.</p><br><p>“From time to time, several Lords may clash and only one may emerge alive. This happens especially often when the Befallen Crown tries to get rid of a neutral Lord.”</p><br><p>Adam grinned as he recalled the brutal and bloody battle Saegar had staged.</p><br><p>“I see. Saegar was just such a case.”</p><br><p>“That’s right. At the Tarnished Lands, the Lords are only found in the depths of these lands. Most often, they have their own small territories where they live peacefully for many years, which are unlikely to end in the next thousand years,” Douglas explained calmly. He had done this before.</p><br><p>Silvana looked at Douglas. “These Lords… I understand that there aren’t very many of them in the Tarnished Lands, but which of the two factions do they belong to? Or are they all neutral?”</p><br><p>In response, Douglas scratched his chin thoughtfully.</p><br><p>“You see, this is where it gets rather complicated, I would even say confusing. The Lords of the Tarnished Lands call themselves the Renegades. They have nothing against the Free End, but many of them are annoyed by the Befallen Crown’s desire to establish control over all monsters.”</p><br><p>Adam grinned as his eyes sparkled with anticipation.</p><br><p>“So, the Renegades? Sounds good, I even want to join them. Hahaha, just kidding!”</p><br><p>For a moment, Douglas’s gaze darkened, but he quickly returned to normal so that no one would notice.</p><br><p>“Hah, don’t forget that they’re still monsters. In some ways, they’re similar to the monsters of the Free End. But, unlike them, the Renegades are still at the mercy of the First Star. All they want is to control their territories and satisfy their desires.” Douglas explained calmly.</p><br><p>Adam chuckled. “Damn it, just like humans. I can understand them. You’ve reached the very top, and you have almost no opponents equal to you in strength, but at the same time, the Befallen Crown is constantly hanging over you. That must be annoying.”</p><br><p>“It is. That’s why they are not as aggressive towards humans as the Befallen Crown. So, if you’re unlucky enough to encounter a Lord, don’t rush to write your will. You might be able to negotiate.”</p><br><p>Silvana touched her lips thoughtfully. “Doesn’t that mean the Renegades are neutral Lords?”</p><br><p>“Not exactly. They’re still a faction, they have their hierarchy and leader, although it’s nowhere near as strict as the Befallen Crown. It’s like comparing an authoritarian army to a free anarchist regime.</p><br><p>“Also, even though you can handle some of the Elders now, I wouldn’t advise you to attack them first.”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam frowned as he waved his hand. “Why should I be wary of them? They’re not Lords!”</p><br><p>“Yes, but almost all Elders obey some Lord. This rule applies both at the Dark Shore and at the Tarnished Lands.”</p><br><p>Douglas’s face became more serious.</p><br><p>“Even if you defeat a powerful Elder, the Lord will most likely come after you. Even if you manage to leave the Tarnished Lands, it will be difficult for you to return. However, if for some reason an Elder attacks you, fight and win.</p><br><p>“Most likely, this Elder either does not have a Lord or did it without a direct order. In that case, only a small number of Lords will pursue you.”</p><br><p>A few moments later, Adam nodded.</p><br><p>“What happens next? I’m going to the Tarnished Lands.”</p><br><br><br><p>Then, he turned to look at Adam and Silvana.</p><br><p>“Right now, you both need to rest and spend time with your families and each other. It’s important, trust me.”</p>
