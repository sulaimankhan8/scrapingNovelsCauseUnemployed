            <br><p>No matter how great a tree or plant was, it all started from a tiny seed, lacking the greatness of its future but possessing to achieve the impossible.</p><br><p>This could not be said for every tree, but for the Evolution Tree, it was completely true.</p><br><p>However, the Evolution Tree was not born from a seed; it came from the synergy between the Spark and the Initial Gene, which created not only enough energy for the Evolution Tree to emerge but also for the inner space to form. Read exclusive chapters at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, looking at the seed floating in front of her.</p><br><p>The first thing she thought of was becoming a Phantom like Adam and abilities, but her mind quickly dismissed the thought.</p><br><p>She knew that neither Beth, Riska, nor the other high-ranking Operators were Phantoms. However... she always felt she didn't know a great deal compared to them, and it wasn't just about information and data access levels.</p><br><p>"What happens if I take it...? What effects follow Gene Diffusion?"</p><br><p>Silvana's lips trembled, goosebumps passed through her body, and her eyes were fixed on the majestic seed possessing the same aura as the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>[Don't overthink... Opportunities... they come gradually... But... something I can tell you... before you make your decision...]</p><br><p>Not daring to interrupt the Evolution Tree, Silvana waited silently, mesmerized by the sight of the seed.</p><br><p>[You and Adam... You will be bound... Not physically or mentally... but by energy... There is a way to break that bond... but a painful one...</p><br><p>I hope it never happens... Silvana Desio.]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree said nothing more.</p><br><p>However, Silvana had another opportunity - behind her, a white door appeared on the far side of the void.</p><br><p>She could walk out of here at any moment, abandon the seed, and return to the very beginning.</p><br><p>Was Silvana going to do that? It was unknown, but she had that option.</p><br><p>"I see... Well, what I've seen and what I've been through is more than enough for me to make my choice."</p><br><br><p>Silvana stepped forward, gently taking the silver sphere in her hands.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the seed turned into a flash, flying into Silvana's chest.</p><br><p>Waves of energy traveled through her body, vibrations spread through the void, and her eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>The same thing was happening outside the inner space, in the real world, while both Adam and Silvana were still asleep.</p><br><p>Stina narrowed her eyes as she watched the white streams of energy actively flowing towards Silvana, her body absorbing it all, and now it looked natural as if she had her own inner space and a place to store the energy.</p><br><p>"Ms. Refesa, is this how it's supposed to be...?" Stina asked uncertainly.</p><br><p>Refesa nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you can start preparing a congratulation speech, since these two made it, and I need to explain everything to them."</p><br><p>Then, Refesa threw her legs off the table as she headed towards the White Cube. She had seen Gene Diffusion happen many times before, so she realized that it was already safe and it was over.</p><br><p>An eyebrow twitched Adam was about to wake up, but both he and Silvana were still immersed in slumber.</p><br><p>"This... this is beautiful..." Silvana gulped, looking at the silver sphere, at the seed floating amidst the darkness.</p><br><p>She didn't know how to describe it, but she felt that her darkness was much smaller than Adam's, as if it had very little room, just for her and the seed.</p><br><p>Uncertainly stepping forward, Silvana reached out her hand towards the sphere, she wanted to, no... she felt she should touch it.</p><br><p>The silver threads slowly swirling around the seed stopped, making way for Silvana's hand and weaving around her wrist like a sleeve.</p><br><p>There was no hostility or rejection from the threads, just curiosity and awkward hospitality.</p><br><br><p>Silvana touched the seed with the tip of her finger, it actively shuddered releasing another thread - an all-white one.</p><br><p>Unlike the silver threads, this one headed upward, plunging into darkness and into another space - connecting with its parent: Adam's Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>Then, Adam and Silvana opened their eyes simultaneously.</p><br><p>They stared at each other as if trying to figure out if they were in the real world or still wandering through memories or illusions.</p><br><p>Something immediately caught their attention.</p><br><p>Adam's right eye shone brightly in white while the same thing was happening to Silvana's left eye.</p><br><p>When they next blinked the glow disappeared, but it was obvious to everyone that it wasn't their imagination.</p><br><br><p>Slow claps sounded from the side, devoid of enthusiasm or sincerity.</p><br><p>"Congratulations. You have completed the Gene Diffusion, when you leave you can take some donuts as a reward." Refesa uttered with a cold face.</p><br><p>However, this in no way hindered Adam and Silvana's joy, there was no explosion of emotions, but the slight smiles on their faces full of happiness were bright enough to outshine even the sun.</p><br><p>Taking their time, Adam and Silvana nodded to each other and turned to Refesa - they had many questions for her, or rather only one of them.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, looking intently at Silvana, at her gaze and smirk on her face.</p><br><p>"Hmm...? What is that sly look and sly smile? Am I missing something?"</p><br><p>In response, Silvana only turned away.</p><br><p>Refesa waved her hand.</p><br><p>"Unlike you, she already knows what she can do. It's not much, but it's more than enough to start with. After all, she only has a seed of your tree, weak and young, but with great potential."</p><br><p>Silvana fixed her hair and nodded slightly.</p><br><p>"Yes, I think it would be best to demonstrate, I'm sure Ms. Refesa has all the explanations."</p><br><p>"Sure." Refesa shrugged.</p><br><p>Curiosity filled Adam's eyes as he slowly nodded.</p><br><p>Silvana smiled bitterly before taking a few steps back.</p><br><p>"Don't expect anything you know how to do. After all, I'm not a Phantom but an Operator, and... that's fine."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the seed in Silvana's inner space quivered once, and the eyes shone brightly, but not Silvana's but Adam's, allowing the energy to flow through her body.</p>
