            <h3>Chapter 53  Three Forces</h3><br><p>Night is a unique time of day because, for children, the darkness is the most terrifying time and not only for them. Many terrible things were committed under the cover of night, but it is difficult to find an adult who would not understand how beautiful was a calm, starry night when you were left only to yourself. </p><br><p>It was at night, when people wanted to do things that would be too awkward or dangerous in daylight, and intimacy was one of them. </p><br><p>Adam lay on the bed looking up at the stars moving slowly across the dark sky. Adam pondered that there was one more star in the sky at some point - the brightest one being the end of the old world and the beginning of the new one - the one he now lived in. </p><br><p>'I wonder... If the Last Star hadn't fallen, what would be happening to me now? Am I... Am I beginning to enjoy the world as it is more and more?' Adam muttered inwardly before turning around. </p><br><p>His gaze drifted to Jena lying next to him, she was asleep and naked, just like him. Adam's heart had been ready to explode with emotions and sensations a while ago, but now there was only calmness and peace. </p><br><p>Then, Adam looked at the skyscrapers and buildings that surrounded them. On this particular day, they decided to stay one night in a hotel. </p><br><p>Adam was determined to get revenge on Aiden Henk, the scientist who had thrown him into the Dead Lands, almost condemning him to death. However, more and more often, Adam thought that if it hadn't happened, he wouldn't have become the Phantom. </p><br><p>"Hah, fate is a cruel thing. When you managed to survive, you are happy for your achievements, but... the voices of a thousand others, those who couldn't, no one will ever hear." Adam smiled bitterly with a deep look before closing his eyes and sinking into sleep. </p><br><br><p>The strong smell of aromatic coffee was the cause of Adam's, awakening followed by breakfast prepared by Jena. </p><br><p>Usually, Jena was strict and assertive, however, now she was sweet which was even a little strange. </p><br><p>Anyone could pick up a sword, but only a master swordsman could become a god of death on the battlefield. </p><br><p>It was a date, not a new life together, so soon they were back in the Third Ring, each in their own homes. </p><br><p>Then, Adam started preparing for the fight against Oscar. He had three days, and it was the perfect incentive to hone his new skills to mastery. </p><br><p>Adam realized that the more complex and complex an ability was, the more potential it had. </p><br><p>Anyone could pick up a sword, but only a master swordsman could become a god of death on the battlefield. </p><br><br><p>"I heard what happened to Amber Ocean, I must say I'm surprised. You were able to get him to pay you such a large amount of money, but... it was still reckless. You shouldn't have agreed to it." Silvana said calmly, sitting down at the table. They were having coffee after practicing in the virtual chamber. </p><br><p>Adam cast a glance at her. </p><br><p>"Why? You think I'm going to lose?' </p><br><p>Silvana shook her head. </p><br><p>"No. You will definitely win, I would even say it will be too easy for you. Oscar Hunt is a K1 Phantom like you, however, unlike you, he hasn't even fought a single Crown Monster yet. He didn't even dare to kill a Granite Ghost in the virtual zone to set his time." Silvana explained. </p><br><p>However, although she answered his question, it didn't make the situation any clearer. He still didn't understand anything. </p><br><p>"Agh... Adam, don't you understand? It won't just be a fight between you and Oscar, there will be an audience there." </p><br><p>"And...? It's an arena, someone will be watching our fight. I'm sure there'll even be bets and stuff like that." Adam waved his hand. </p><br><p>"Sure, but the thing is, among them will also be those who want to recruit you." Silvana nodded deeply. </p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow. </p><br><p>"Recruit? Do you mean squads? Isn't it bad to get a few offers? I don't mind teamwork sometimes, you know." Adam shrugged nonchalantly. </p><br><p>"Not squads, because the fight won't be in Dead Lands, but in the center of the Citadel, in the First Ring. As you know, where there are no monsters, people start fighting each other, because if there's no common enemy you have to make one. Obviously, I'm not talking about civil war, there's a more refined and nasty way of doing it - politics." "Politics...? Does that make any sense? It's obvious to everyone that our main purpose is to fight monsters and defend the Citadel, does anyone disagree with that?" Adam said outrageously. He couldn't believe that anyone could be against it. </p><br><p>Silvana shook her head. </p><br><p>"Of course, it's not about that. If the goal is clear, what about the way to achieve it? That's what all arguments are based on. I didn't want to burden you with this too early, but the situation leaves me no other choice." Silvana said before pressing something on her tablet. </p><br><p>Several holographic images floated above the table. </p><br><p>"These are the main organizations in the Citadel. Each has its own ideology as well as symbol. Take a close look at them before I continue." </p><br><p>The emblem of a blue flower with six pointed petals - Azure Lotus. </p><br><p>The emblem of a cracked broad sword engulfed in black flames - Dark Order. </p><br><p>The emblem of a silver cross with five rubies covered in heavy blood flowing downwards - Crimson Path. "Adam, you must realize that there are millions of people living in the Citadel, it's a huge resource, and everyone thinks they know how best to use it. Let's start with the Azure Lotus. Their goals are pretty simple - equality between Phantoms, departments, and ordinary people. </p><br><p> According to their ideology, everyone works for the Citadel, for humanity, giving as much effort as possible. It's not absolute equality, of course, but you get the idea." </p><br><p>Adam nodded. He felt a little strange, like he was in a history class, even though this was part of their world. </p><br><p>"Next, Dark Order - in some ways, they're the opposite of Azure Lotus. They believe that the Phantoms are the most important, and no one should doubt that. Furthermore, the Dark Order believes that a Phantom can afford as much as its abilities deserve. Roughly speaking, the stronger you are the higher your position overall." </p><br><p>"I see... Apparently, they have the most influence, right?" Adam asked. </p><br><p>Silvana nodded and said, "Yes, their position is natural and easy to realize as well as understand. By the way, Damien is one of the pillars that Dark Order stands on." </p><br><p>Adam smiled, "Hah, that's not surprising. That's probably why he gave me Golden Mission so easily, even though he wasn't technically entitled to it." </p><br><p>"The last one is Crimson Path. They're not as influential as Azure Lotus or Dark Order, but they're slowly growing. Their idea is based on bloodlines and that Phantoms should make an effort to preserve bloodlines and create new ones. All to get more youths to have Sparks." </p><br><p>Adam nodded understandingly. He remembered Oscar's words, which rhetorically were quite similar. </p><br><p>"Also..." Silvana paused as if it were something important, "They don't talk about it in public, but among a higher circle, they actively promote the idea of Naturalborn Phantoms. Crimson Path believes that Naturalones are far superior to Artificialones and that we should take the risk of letting some people try to become Natural Phantoms." </p><br><p>Silvana looked intently at Adam. </p><br><p>"They don't know it, but to them, you would be a very important member." </p><br><p>Adam sighed heavily. </p><br><p>"Fuck... Don't we have enough problems with monsters? Why do people always try to make things so complicated?"</p>
