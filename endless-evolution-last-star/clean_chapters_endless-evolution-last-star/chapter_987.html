            <br><p>Risha had a new ability, she was much stronger thanks to the influx of energy and Radiant Mirage's help in fixing her flaws.</p><br><p>Naturally, she wanted to see what she was capable of, and the best way to test it was with Adam.</p><br><p>But... Even though he hadn't even seen her attack, it still failed miserably.</p><br><br><p>Risha crashed into the wall with a clatter, a cloud of dust rose hiding her silhouette, and a muffled, painful scream.</p><br><p>The silver threads returned to their owner, accomplishing a simple but effective task.</p><br><br><p>With a menacing look, Risha leaped out of the smoke screen, charging straight at Adam. But, no sooner had her claws touched him than he grabbed her wrist and brought her to the ground.</p><br><p>The bun was still in his mouth, and his other hand was occupied by a clay flask.</p><br><p>Lying on the ground, Risha blinked a few times in a disbelief staring at Adam, his expression was unconcerned.</p><br><p>"Nice try. But haven't you thought of controlling your aura?"</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Risha appeared confused. She completely forgot about it.</p><br><p>Before she could answer, Radiant Mirage's voice echoed in her head.</p><br><p>'Don't listen to him. He's just messing with you. You completely hid your aura, you did it unknowingly just by experience.'</p><br><p>'But... How did he have time to react then?' Risha was baffled watching Adam finish eating his bun.</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage shook his head. 'He just did it. He spotted you and smoothly counterattacked you. It's amazing, but it's not impossible. After all, he is one stage ahead of you.'</p><br><p>Adam finished a bun and leaned over, holding out his hand to her.</p><br><p>With a slight hesitation, Risha grabbed his hand, rising from the ground.</p><br><p>"Well, well, that seems to have gone well, right?" Adam asked, pointing to the mirrored boots.</p><br><p>Risha scratched the back of her head awkwardly. "Yeah... Something like that. The External Artifact, the real one, is a valuable ally. Radiant Mirage is a million times better than just the blob of energy that took up space in my Initial Gene."</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage, hovering inside her inner space, blushed. He didn't expect Risha to say something like that, but she didn't notice it, and he quickly returned the serious expression.</p><br><br><p>"Sure, it was bound to happen at some point. Moreover, I can feel your aura has become a bit more powerful. It looks like Radiant Mirage did a decent job inside your space, doesn't it?"</p><br><p>"Hah, something like that, but..." Risha clenched her fists irritably as she glared at him. "Anyway! I couldn't beat you again! I'm sick of this already! It's pissing me off! Lose to me at least once!"</p><br><p>Adam shrugged. "Nope."</p><br><br><p>Then, he raised his gaze to the star-crystal. It was still holding its shape, but with each passing hour, more cracks appeared, and the energy was quickly running out. After all, the owner of this crystal had left his former home.</p><br><p>"It doesn't matter if you can beat me or not," Adam muttered, his eyes growing darker. "Lose to me ten times or a hundred, it'll be a lot better than losing once to Kreyna."</p><br><p>Risha wanted to say something but didn't have time. Adam's stern gaze made her flinch.</p><br><p>"Here in the caves of resistance, if you lose, you lose almost nothing, a few bruises and frustration, that's all. But... one defeat against Kreyna or the Light Legion and you will be finished. She will kill you."</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam's words had a powerful effect on Risha.</p><br><p>She understood all of this, and had faced death many times, but... she had a feeling that only now the things were real.</p><br><p>"Shit... You're right," she bit her lip, lowering her head. "There's no one here at the Fallen Ring Castle to protect me. I doubt my brother is looking out for me even here."</p><br><br><p>Adam touched her shoulder, clapping slowly.</p><br><p>"Don't think about it too much. You're a K3-Phantom, and you've already gone most of the way to reach a K4-Level. Hah, who knows, maybe pretty soon you'll reach the same level as Orel.</p><br><p>"We don't have much time left. First, I slept for a few days, and now you. But we can still have time to help you get stronger."</p><br><p>Risha puffed up her cheeks, placing her hands at her sides. "Pffft! You mean you're going to train me? You're just as much a K3-Phantom as I am!"</p><br><p>"Hah, yeah, but I'm stronger. Furthermore, did you forget what Vorx said about?"</p><br><p>Confusion covered her face.</p><br><br><br><p>"If you open the fourth lesser gates you'll fight alongside him against Kreyna and most likely you'll win!"</p><br><p>Well, Adam didn't know all the details of the plan. Heret told him that he would explain everything to them before the revolt began and the arrival of the Light Legion.</p><br><p>But Adam knew that he, Risha, and the four resistance leaders, especially Heret and Vorx, were the key fighters.</p><br><p>How well they performed against the Light Legion, Kreyna and Arnoth was almost everything.</p><br><p>It didn't matter how well the other serpents performed. If Adam and Heret couldn't beat Arnoth, and Risha with Vorx lost against Kreyna, it would be over.</p><br><p>The other serpents simply wouldn't be able to defeat these two strong S5 monsters that were on the edge of evolution.</p><br><p>Risha's eyes went wide when Adam reminded her of the fourth gate. Engaging in battle against Radiant Mirage, she put all her energy into concluding the pact.</p><br><br><p>Adam headed forward, straight toward the dark field.</p><br><p>"Come on. We'll fight right there. You saw what I did to open my gate. I'm not sure the same method will work for you, but one thing is certain."</p><br><p>Fire lit up in his eyes as the energy ran through his body in a wave.</p><br><p>"Only by putting yourself in difficult, critical conditions can you figure out what you want. And... There's something else."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Risha raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"I don't know why, but the Evolution Tree only prompts you when you're at your limit. Who knows, maybe you're the one who figured it all out at that moment, and the Evolution Tree just helps you remember?"</p>
