            <br><p>Osana had three wishes, she could ask Adam for anything except for him to die for her. Since almost any wish was less important and worth less than a saved life, that's exactly what Osana did to Adam.</p><br><p>The first two wishes Osana spent just to spend the evening and dinner with Adam. This relaxed him, he expected the third wish to be just as innocuous and simple.</p><br><p>Adam figured that Osana herself didn't know why she had created this situation with the three wishes, so she was using them for every little thing.</p><br><p>But... when Osana uttered her third wish, Adam realized that it was still Osana.</p><br><p>Each of her actions made sense since the past two wishes were just empty wishes, they were harmless and made Adam feel uncomfortable.</p><br><p>He was a little bothered that Osana had used her two wishes to arrange a dinner where Adam only got pleasure and a unique experience.</p><br><p>He wanted to fulfill her third wish, no matter what it would be, though Adam only had that confidence because he didn't know what was awaiting him.</p><br><br><p>A lone stream of wind blew over Adam's shoulders, heading towards Osana, who stood confidently on one knee, holding her outstretched hand with the wedding ring, while her other hand was placed against her chest like a knight.</p><br><p>'What...? Does she want to get married? Is this her third wish...? Damn... She did everything too fast with immense pressure... No.</p><br><p>What am I even thinking?! How can this be her wish? What's even going on here!!!'</p><br><p>Adam inwardly exclaimed. Osana's suggestion was enough to start a real chaos inside Adam.</p><br><p>At first, he thought it was a joke or he misheard, but... that was hardly possible considering the engagement ring and Osana's serious look.</p><br><p>"Adam, I'm willing to wait as long as necessary, but I think the answer is already obvious, isn't it?"</p><br><p>Osana said calmly as if she was talking about something trivial, something people did every day and didn't give it a second thought.</p><br><p>"You won't deny me my last wish."</p><br><p>It wasn't a question, it was an assertion, but one that left Adam no room for indignation.</p><br><p>"Wait! Osana! This is not normal!" Adam exclaimed with a wave of his hand, "I can't just do this! At least explain to me what's going on here?!"</p><br><p>Adam was completely confused.</p><br><p>In his mind, two people got married when they loved each other, had been dating for a while, and had already gotten used to each other's strengths and weaknesses and familiarized themselves with the household.</p><br><p>None of these things happened in Osana's case.</p><br><p>All there was between them was one unusual dinner where Osana showed no interest in Adam as a love partner.</p><br><p>It looked as if it was a trap from which Adam could not escape.</p><br><p>But, even so, Adam wanted to understand what the point of this trap was. Why did Osana do it?</p><br><p>There was no answer to his question.</p><br><p>Osana simply extended her hand slightly forward, showing Adam her wedding ring. Her steady gaze demonstrated that she wasn't going to back down or explain anything.</p><br><p>Her gaze literally consumed Adam, reminding him that this was her last and most important wish, that she had saved his life, and that he promised that he would do anything.</p><br><br><p>Sure, but... what next? Would he just run away and start ignoring Osana for an unknown amount of time?</p><br><p>It wasn't easy, but after a minute Adam just gave up.</p><br><p>"Fine, I agree, but you have to explain to me what's going on here." Adam said sternly with a deep sigh.</p><br><p>Osana smiled as she lowered her head slightly.</p><br><p>It wasn't clear from her face, but she cared deeply. This was her one and only best opportunity to get Adam to marry her.</p><br><p>To do that, she used two wishes for dinner, came here, and chose the right time and place, as well as made Adam say that he would do anything, no matter what the third wish would be.</p><br><p>In a way, Osana was similar to Silvana in that they both tried to maximize their chances of success in every possible way before acting.</p><br><p>Perhaps if Silvana was more cunning and devious, then if she were the Phantom she would be almost a replica of the Osana.</p><br><p>Continue your adventure with empire</p><br><p>Hearing Adam's response, Osana didn't say anything.</p><br><p>Instead, she walked over to Adam, got down on one knee again, and confidently placed the ring on his finger.</p><br><p>It was proof that she won and Adam was obliged to fulfill her last wish to the very end.</p><br><p>"Adam, your last name is Vinter, right?" Osana asked, standing up straight, in front of him.</p><br><p>Adam gulped at such a sudden question.</p><br><p>"Yes... Adam Vinter... What?"</p><br><p>Osana's corners of her mouth went up when she bit down on her pinky finger.</p><br><p>"Osana Vinter, not bad, not bad at all. Or... maybe you'd like to take my last name? Well, I guess you can decide that a little later."</p><br><br><p>Adam's hand came into motion as he gripped Osana's wrist tightly with a menacing look.</p><br><p>"Osana. I demand an explanation. If you won't tell me anything then I will simply marry you and file for divorce the same day and we will never see each other again. If you want that outcome you can continue to keep quiet."</p><br><p>Now that Adam had accepted Osana's offer and was beginning to fulfill her third wish he had freedom of action. He could attack her and set ultimatums that she was obliged to adjust to.</p><br><p>However, Osana was not intimidated as she didn't mind satisfying Adam's curiosity.</p><br><p>"Sure, my dear future husband."</p><br><p>Osana smirked, confidently taking Adam by the collar and bringing his face closer.</p><br><p>"I'll tell you everything, but not here. We're lucky no one came here during our big event."</p><br><br><p>Then, she turned around, heading for the crowded part of the park.</p><br><p>"Follow me if you want to learn more about your future wife."</p><br><p>Adam shook his head with a grimace.</p><br><p>'Shit... the Plague Reaper... Because you were insanely strong I have to get married now? Seriously?'</p>
