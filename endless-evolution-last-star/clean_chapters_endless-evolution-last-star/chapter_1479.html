            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1479: Little Sister</strong></p><br><p>Of course, Leona knew what kind of relationship Adam and Silvana had. After all, she was his mother and simply couldn’t help but know about such things.</p><br><p>She may not have understood much about the work at the Dead Lands, but unlike Adam and Silvana, she had long since gone through all the stages of a relationship, right up to marriage and the birth of two beautiful children.</p><br><p>“Mom, this…” Adam looked down, embarrassed. “This isn’t what I’ve been thinking about lately. We’ve only been officially dating for a relatively short time, so… I don’t think either of us is ready for marriage.”</p><br><p>Leona didn’t know this, but the question was particularly poignant given that Adam and Silvana had met Alexia and Louis at the casino. By some miracle, the two were already married, and everything was going well for them.</p><br><p>“Well, sometimes it can be unexpected, and sometimes…” Leona shot a sharp glance in Gary’s direction. “You have to wait a very long time!”</p><br><p>“What?” Gary protested. “We had only been dating for six months at that point! I spent most of that time trying to save up enough money to buy a ring!”</p><br><p>Leona purred and tugged his cheek like a child.</p><br><p>“Hah, I know, I’m just kidding. But… I could see it in your eyes. I knew what you were going to do several months before that day. So, in circumstances like that, it’s always harder to wait, and I’m not the most patient person.”</p><br><p>Gary snorted. ” Oh, you’re telling me? I know that better than anyone!”</p><br><p>Leona turned her gaze back to Adam.</p><br><p>“I know it’s still too early, but when the time comes, you have to be sure. Everyone thinks they have all the time in the world, but they don’t realize that every year is important and it’s better to do it here and now.”</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly. His mother didn’t even realize the meaning behind her words.</p><br><p>‘Yeah, you’re right,’ Adam thought. ‘You have no idea how little time we have… All of us.’</p><br><br><p>Adam came home late, and they sat talking for several hours, so when they went to bed, dawn was already breaking.</p><br><p>Obviously, in this scenario, Adam slept for a long, long time. There was a room in the house, his room, that no one had used yet. When he fell onto the clean sheets of the soft mattress, he didn’t notice how his eyes closed.</p><br><p>It wasn’t until lunchtime that Adam woke up, feeling better than ever.</p><br><p>In fact, he had already done everything he needed to do, almost everything. All that was left was to go with Silvana and buy a house for them.</p><br><p>“Huh…” Adam chuckled. “Since when did buying a house become as easy for me as buying groceries at the store? I have to go back to the Dead Lands before I get the urge to lose all my money at the casino like Alexia did. But…”</p><br><p>He buried his face in the pillow.</p><br><p>“Before that, I’m going to get some proper rest.”</p><br><p>Adam decided he wasn’t going to rush things. The most important moments, when he became stronger, usually happened over the course of several days. He spent most of his time resting and preparing.</p><br><p>So, he could do it right now and then return to the Dead Lands with full strength.</p><br><br><p>Adam rolled from one side of the bed to the other, then again and again, until he collapsed on the floor.</p><br><p>“Shit… Looks like I have no choice but to wake up now, right?”</p><br><p>With difficulty, Adam got up from the floor and headed to the kitchen with a sleepy look on his face.</p><br><p>The first person he saw was not Gary or Leona, but a girl who was now 8 years old, a little taller, and with longer hair.</p><br><p>As soon as she turned around and saw Adam, her eyes lit up like two stars.</p><br><p>“Brother!” Trici exclaimed as she ran towards him at full speed.</p><br><p>Even though Adam was a K4-Phantom, when Trici crashed into him, it felt like a mountain had fallen on him. He had to make an effort not to fall with her.</p><br><p>“Hey… I stayed out a little late yesterday, you were already asleep.”</p><br><p>Trici puffed out her cheeks in displeasure. “I waited for you all evening and half the night! What can you do at night in the city?!”</p><br><p>‘Actually, a lot,’ Adam thought as he looked at his sister. ‘But she’s still too young to know about casinos and other things, and that’s for the best!’</p><br><p>“Hah, well, I was just hanging out with my… my girlfriend.”</p><br><p>“Girlfriend?” Trici smirked slyly. “I didn’t even know my brother was a womanizer!”</p><br><p>“Agh…?” Adam didn’t know what to say.</p><br><p>Trici stepped aside as she waved her hand.</p><br><p>“Although it’s Silvana, right? Pffft, she acts like a teacher at the academy! She needs to learn how to have fun!”</p><br><p>Adam scratched his cheek, trying to figure out where Trici had learned this.</p><br><p>‘What the hell are kids doing on the internet and their VR games? Brrrr, it’s none of my business.’</p><br><br><p>At that moment, footsteps sounded behind them as Leona entered the kitchen with a bag of flour in her hands.</p><br><p>“Oh, you two are here. Great, you can help me cook!”</p><br><p>Adam didn’t mind, but Trici’s reaction was different. As soon as she heard that, she turned around and tried to run away from the kitchen.</p><br><br><br><p>She didn’t stand a chance. Leona grabbed her by the hair, preventing her from escaping.</p><br><p>“Where are you going?” Leona stared at Trici with a fiery gaze. “You spend all your time playing games, but today you’re going to help me bake a cake for your brother and father. Do you understand me?”</p><br><br><br><p>Adam just smiled bitterly and headed for the cupboards.</p><br><br><p>“Great!” Leona exclaimed. “Trici, follow your brother’s example!”</p><br><p>Adam shook his head internally. He had too much to do to get involved in their business. Leona could be quite strict at times, due to her fiery temper, but she was definitely a good mother.</p><br><p>“Adam, what filling do you want?” Leona asked.</p><br><p>“Hmm? What do we have?” He asked.</p><br><br><p>“Hah, considering where we are? We have everything!”</p>
