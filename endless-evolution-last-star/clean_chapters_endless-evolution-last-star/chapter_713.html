            <br><p>Katrin always wanted to be strong and lead people, and a few months ago she got that opportunity and used it to the fullest.</p><br><p>However, like most, she wasn't used to and didn't want to see the Phantoms die, especially such brutal, quick, and most importantly senseless deaths.</p><br><p>Katrin gulped, her fingertips trembling.</p><br><p>Yet, it wasn't the first time Katrin saw something like that. One deep breath and a sharp jerk of her head were enough for her to regain her serious, collected expression.</p><br><p>Her cold black eyes stared intently at the archer, then at the bloodstains on the black sand quickly disappearing under the waves.</p><br><p>"Alan, who are those bastards on the towers? The way I see it there's only four of them, right?"</p><br><p>Making a few clicks, Alan nodded with a frustrated face:</p><br><p>'Yes, that's the One-Eyed Serpent Archers, they're very rare Mid-Yellow Monsters, but from the looks of it they strictly follow the fortress's rules and External Artifact's.'</p><br><p>Before Katrin could say anything, Alan continued:</p><br><p>'Oddly enough, this is new information since no one has come here in a very long time, this is the Red Zone after all.'</p><br><p>Katrin's eyebrow went up.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Before Eclipse, someone had a mission in the Fortress of the Lone Serpent? When was that?"</p><br><p>She hadn't counted on this Phantom still being inside, but the latest information about the dangerous Stronghold could save them a lot of lives, it was essential to Eclipse's successful survival.</p><br><p>For some reason, Alan was delayed in answering. Katrin realized that normally this didn't happen.</p><br><p>"Is something wrong?" Katrin was puzzled.</p><br><br><p>Alan furrowed his eyebrows heavily, scrutinizing the information available to him.</p><br><p>'The problem is that I see that the data on the fortress has been updated in detail several times. That means that as recently as an hour ago, a Phantom was inside and did a lot of work, but... I can't find a mission with the right conditions...''</p><br><p>Then, Alan's eyes went wide as he logged into the Department of Missions and Military roster.</p><br><p>'Wait... The information on this mission is classified. I don't know what kind of Phantom it was or what its purpose was, but... there's no record of the mission having been completed.'</p><br><br><p>"I see... So that means that this Phantom is still inside, right? That's good, it must be someone strong if it decided to go to Red Zone alone."</p><br><p>However, there was no confirmation of her words from Alan.</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that Alan had seen that such a mission existed, but instead of details and the Phantom's name, he only saw [Unknown] or random characters blocking the information.</p><br><br><p>Alan muttered as his large, always bright eyes grew darker.</p><br><p>'This Phantom, a few minutes ago denied the military's request to join you, to join other Phantoms to defend the fortress. I have no further information.'</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Katrin's face contorted in wild anger, her veins swelling hard and her eyes bloodshot.</p><br><p>Soon, out of Katrin's throat came a sound more like the growl of a frenzied beast.</p><br><p>"What did you say...? That bastard is strong enough to go solo to the Red Zone, but refused to help us? FUCK IT! It's just a fucking coward!" Stay connected through My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Alan didn't say anything, it was dangerous when Katrin was in this state.</p><br><br><p>Furious, Katrin stomped the ground, kicking up dark dust, her coat shaking, sharing her emotions until... she was distracted by footsteps coming from outside:</p><br><br><p>The second squad, reached the bridge, they were the first since the first squad was lost...</p><br><br><p>A tall man with short spiky black hair and green eyes stepped forward. His clothes were covered in wide pieces of cloth suitable for locations with strong winds and sandstorms, and a red mask dangled from his chin.</p><br><p>"My name is Viron, I am the leader of the second squad. We have been informed that you are K2W1-Phantom, is that correct?"</p><br><p>Viron didn't know what had made Katrin so angry, neither did the rest of his squad, but they had to act quickly and clearly, ignoring such things.</p><br><p>Realizing that she had a responsibility for the others, that this was her opportunity to prove herself in a real crisis, Katrin paused for a few moments.</p><br><p>Then, she took a deep breath and closed her eyes. Soon, everyone saw her calm as watery black eyes, serene crystals hiding cruelty and strength.</p><br><p>"Yes, that's right. I am Katrin Graeme, I had a solo mission, but as in your case, the sudden Eclipse changed my plans."</p><br><p>Without slowing her pace, Katrin pointed towards the south wall, where the first squad had died.</p><br><p>"There are four deadly monsters on the walls, according to my Operator they won't touch us if we enter through the bridge. This is verified information."</p><br><p>Several Phantoms got pale faces looking at the remains of the first squad. The realization that only one monster did it in a single shot sent chills down their spines.</p><br><p>But, Viron was more resilient than his squad members, he simply nodded.</p><br><p>"Sure, right now, the latest information is flowing through all the squads heading here. However, even if we can be sure that the rules are working thanks to the unknown Phantom..."</p><br><p>Viron's expression became sad for a moment as he clenched his fists tightly. He, like many, wished that this Phantom was with them instead of hiding inside the fortress for unknown reasons.</p><br><p>"What do we do with the Blinding Sylphyre? Do we wait for the others and attack together?"</p><br><p>In response, Katrin stopped him with her hand and stepped forward, her black coat surging upwards, actively shivering in anticipation.</p><br><p>"Don't worry about that. I want you to help the others get here safely, the waves of monsters haven't come yet, but there are more and more enemies around."</p><br><br><p>Katrin gripped the hilt of her sword tightly confidently stepping onto the bridge, provoking the first guard.</p><br><p>"I'll deal with the Blinding Sylphyre. Right after that, we'll burst through the gate and wait for dawn!"</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, in the depths of the fortress, equally important events were taking place.</p><br><p>Adam, his hand touching Lone Blaze, while the flames slowly enveloped him.</p><br><p>Very soon, their Pact would be concluded.</p>
