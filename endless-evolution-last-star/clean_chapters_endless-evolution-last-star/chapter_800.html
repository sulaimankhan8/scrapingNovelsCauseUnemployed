            <br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch patted himself on the shoulder knocking dust and sticking dirty snow off his robes.</p><br><p>His gaze traveled to his wing, embers smoldering on the flesh, delaying the start of regeneration.</p><br><p>"I see, it doesn't look like I should be able to fly anytime soon. It's probably for the best, though. Adam proved too strong to defeat him quickly in the air. On the ground, he will go to the end."</p><br><p>For a moment, a shadow reflected in his eyes, the silhouette approached the dangerous monster in a few leaps, stopping ten meters away from the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>Katrin was in no hurry, ready to fight, but not to rush forward taking pointless risks.</p><br><p>Thus Adam and Katrin were on opposite sides of each other, the Crimson Monarch was between them.</p><br><p>The monsters and other Phantoms nearby were doing their best to get as far away and fast as possible.</p><br><p>This was not a fight in which they could get anything but a quick death.</p><br><p>A cold wind coming from the three ice towers blew along the serpent lands, rippling the Crimson Monarch's blond hair partially covering his deep eyes.</p><br><p>He turned slowly in Katrin's direction, then pointed his gaze toward Adam.</p><br><p>"Are you kidding me?"</p><br><p>There was no indignation in his voice, only confusion.</p><br><p>"I didn't expect you to ask for support. Moreover..." he glanced at Katrin, her legs trembling with fear, she tried to hide it, but it couldn't escape his gaze, "She's much weaker than you."</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly, he shrugged shaking his head.</p><br><p>"Well, that's not something I can influence."</p><br><p>"So you won't mind if I kill her right now? It won't take me more than ten seconds."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch lifted his chin, watching for the slightest change in Adam's expression.</p><br><p>"You're going to wait for me? That would be the highest form of courtesy on your part."</p><br><p>[Don't even think of agreeing! Attack him together right now!]</p><br><p>Lone Blaze was not satisfied that Adam was calmly listening to his enemy.</p><br><p>However, Adam seemed not to hear her.</p><br><p>"Ten seconds, you say?"</p><br><p>[No! Fuck no! Don't even think about it!]</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly, looking around carelessly.</p><br><p>"Sure, I can go for it."</p><br><p>If any other monster or even human had been in the Crimson Monarch's place, one would have smirked slyly at the success of his cunning plan, but the Crimson Monarch simply nodded in appreciation.</p><br><p>Clutching his injured wing to his back, he slowly turned in Katrin's direction.</p><br><p>Her eyes were wide, she had heard their conversation and couldn't believe that somehow she somehow become the target of their game.</p><br><p>Now was not the time to argue, all Katrin could do was grit her teeth in fear to prepare for the worst.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch turned his head slightly, looking at Adam over his shoulder.</p><br><p>"Are you going to signal? Ten seconds, I remember."</p><br><p>"Hah, don't worry, you'll have the signal." Adam raised his hands, palms wide open.</p><br><p>The tips of his fingers twitched as he nodded in Katrin's direction.</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam clapped his palms together, a single distinct ringing sound spread for hundreds of meters around.</p><br><p>By the time the sound reached the Phantoms in the fortress, the Crimson Monarch's silhouette loomed in front of Katrin.</p><br><p>His right arm was raised for an attack, claws tensed, ready to thrust into her chest like a deadly spear.</p><br><p>Against Adam, he used lightning and thunderbolts, but to kill someone weaker, all he needed was his physical strength.</p><br><p>Apparently, the Phantoms didn't understand what Adam was doing or why he was letting the Crimson Monarch do this, nor did Katrin, yet she couldn't think about it anymore.</p><br><p>'To hell with it! I have to fight! That's what I came here for!'</p><br><p>In the blink of an eye, Katrin crossed her swords before her, red claw slashing into the black blades, cascades of sparks flying across the Crimson Monarch's calm eyes.</p><br><p>"Hmm... Astonishing..." he muttered, looking at Katrin's weapon, "It's not often you see such a powerful weapon from such a weakling."</p><br><p>An eerie grimace covered Katrin's face, her hands actively shaking holding the block.</p><br><p>"What the fuck did you say?"</p><br><p>"I think I made myself clear. You're not worthy of your gear."</p><br><p>Before Katrin could respond, the Crimson Monarch turned abruptly, currents of wind fluttering his clothes.</p><br><br><p>His foot slammed into Katrin's face throwing her aside. In a spinning projectile, Katrin plunged into a pile of sand.</p><br><p>The red streams of energy headed toward the Crimson Monarch's extended hand, a bright orb forming on the tip of his finger in a second.</p><br><p>Before Katrin could recover from the crushing kick, a lighting ray flew in her direction.</p><br><p>All Katrin could see was the energy ripples traveling from the Crimson Monarch's hand as the scarlet flash covered her.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Her coat shuddered, a large black jaw coming out of her shoulder, devouring the ray in a single bite.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's eyes went wide.</p><br><br><p>Electric shocks ran along the entire coat, traveling back to the jaw, bright light bursting out of the gaps between the dark fangs.</p><br><p>Trembling from the overwhelming power, the black jaw hurriedly opened, unleashing a dense shell into the Crimson Monarch's side.</p><br><p>He didn't even bother to dodge, as he was petrified standing still. The projectile flew close to his neck, pieces of cloth snapping off his shoulder.</p><br><p>"How...?" he muttered in disbelief before taking a step forward.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's silhouette towered over her, staring into her terrified eyes with a detached look.</p><br><p>"How can you be so helpless with such a weapon?"</p><br><p>He wasn't trying to humiliate or morally attack Katrin, it was a sincere question and it made the situation many times worse.</p><br><p>"Whatever, I don't need you anyway."</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Dense electrical discharges descended along his arm, becoming an extension of his gauntlet. Five lightning claws headed toward Katrin, about to end her life.</p><br><p>Without wasting a moment, the Crimson Monarch made a high-speed thrust, there was no way Katrin could defend against this attack.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, something grabbed his wrist, preventing him from advancing any further.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch raised his head, meeting Adam's eyes, a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Ten seconds. You should glance around less."</p><br><p>Then, a fist reflected in the Crimson Monarch's bloodshot eyes.</p>
