            <br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda continued to eavesdrop on the conversation between their brother and the nobles.</p><br><p>Sure, they already heard something that normal people weren't supposed to know, but it wasn't the first case.</p><br><p>From time to time, Fromund was visited by people offering jobs, and his sisters took this opportunity to quench their curiosity and worry for their brother.</p><br><p>Hearing Fromund's last words, Elva bit her lip, Liv and Tilda's gaze grew gloomier and their looks darker.</p><br><p>They remembered their life in the Lower Ring, the place where they were born and lived for the first few years of their lives.</p><br><p>It was only thanks to their brother that they could get out of that blighted place and end up here, in the quiet Third Ring, which was a paradise compared to where they lived before.</p><br><p>Well, the Lower Ring wasn't such a creepy place for everyone, though life there was much different from the Upper Ring and had many peculiarities and quirks.</p><br><p>It was just... Fromund's and his sisters' situation was bad even compared to the harshest instances in the Lower Ring.</p><br><p>"Well... I must say that I don't like this idea and I especially don't like that arrogant guy who doesn't appreciate other people's freedom and desires." Fromund nonchalantly said pointing at Nirosh.</p><br><p>Nirosh's face filled with indignation, but after the painful episode, he no longer tried to argue with Fromund.</p><br><p>Mariel and Zarot were also acting calm and composed.</p><br><p>Fromund realized that if they came to him, they had no other choice. After they told him all the details, their position became even more obvious to him.</p><br><p>He didn't hesitate to use this to voice his opinion and strengthen his position in the negotiations.</p><br><p>"However, I'm not going to make an angel of myself, I'm far from a good person and I have goals that need to be accomplished in order to..." Fromund's gaze deepened, "To one day breathe a sigh of relief."</p><br><p>Mariel's lips quivered as she glanced at Fromund with pleading eyes.</p><br><p>"Please don't refuse, the other Phantoms from Branch Squads are good for nothing. At least among the K2W0-Level, the Marzo Family hasn't found anyone who has a decent chance against Adam Vinter."</p><br><p>Zarot remained silent. They still had some time before the 3 A. M. He waited for his moment.</p><br><p>"Oh, did I say I was going to back out? I'm willing to work and fight on The Rule of Power, it all depends on what reward you offer me."</p><br><p>Fromund waved his hand confidently in front of him.</p><br><p>"I'll tell you right off the bat, I realize how wide your options are, so don't even think you can get me as a fighter on the cheap."</p><br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda smiled contentedly. They liked it when their brother acted confident and a good reward could help solve their problems, at least part of them...</p><br><p>And, this was the moment when the one who was silent for a long time decided to enter into negotiations.</p><br><p>"Of course! Don't worry we won't insult you!" Zarot exclaimed with a wide grin, "We at Marzo Family know how to pay a decent wage no matter if you're a cook, a gardener, or a Phantom!"</p><br><p>Enjoy new adventures from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Fromund didn't react. To him, those words were nothing more than nothing.</p><br><p>"I'm sure you as a Phantom don't have serious money problems, so we're willing to offer you help with future missions, any support for your sisters, and their education, if you want we can find you a home in a decent, quiet and safe place."</p><br><p>For a while longer, Zarot continued to list everything they could do for Fromund and his younger sisters.</p><br><p>However... none of it brought a sparkle to Fromund's deep blue eyes.</p><br><p>"Well, what do you think? Was I able to catch your interest?" Zarot asked, trying not to lose his enthusiasm, though he sensed something was wrong.</p><br><p>Fromund took a deep breath, leaning back in his chair.</p><br><p>"Oddly enough, you were wrong from the start. I need money exclusively. A lot, I need a hell of a lot of money."</p><br><p>Zarot raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>"Why? I assume you owe someone a large sum of money don't you?"</p><br><p>Fromund nodded slightly, confirming his assumption.</p><br><p>"Damn! Then just tell us who you owe the money to and we'll pay off your loan or whatever it is. If that's not possible, then we'll just deal with who you owe the money to! We can do that." Zarot waved his hand, a bright fire in his eyes.</p><br><p>Fromund shook his head.</p><br><p>"I understand why you think that way, but the amount of money I owe is too large. To provide such an amount, you will need to convene a family council and it's not certain that all of you will agree. Moreover, we don't have time for that."</p><br><p>Then, Fromund leaned forward, his gaze thoughtful and his hands folded together.</p><br><p>"The second option isn't good either. You can't destroy the people I owe money to, it's someone from Lower Ring, it's..."</p><br><p>At this moment, Romund's voice became too quiet, Elva, Liv, and Tilda couldn't hear his last words. However, it didn't make much difference since they knew about their debt and what, or rather who it was because of.</p><br><p>But, Mariel, Zarot, and Nirosh heard everything.</p><br><p>Their eyes went wide, they realized that this was not an opponent they could destroy or force to do what they wanted with the authority of a great family, one of the Twelve Branches.</p><br><p>After all, the Lower Ring also had its powerhouses, making rules and spreading influence across the dark side of the Citadel as the Twelve Branches and Big Three did.</p><br><p>"I see... Unfortunately, this is truly beyond us... For the sake of changing the outcome of a wedding, no one would start a war..." Zarot's gaze darkened.</p><br><br><p>"However, we can still agree on a sum that will greatly ease my debt situation and motivate me to fight for The Rule of Power."</p><br><p>Mariel gulped, as she put her palm to her chest.</p><br><p>"Wait, tell me what happened. How did you get out of the Lower Ring and why exactly do you, one older brother, and three teenage girls owe such a monstrous debt to... equally terrible people."</p><br><p>Fromund was ready for that question from the start.</p><br><p>He took a deep breath, tapped his chin, and looked away.</p><br><p>"Then prepare to hear a story about the worst mother and father ever." Fromund stared at Mariel, "Especially about the mother..."</p><br><p>Mariel's face went pale.</p>
