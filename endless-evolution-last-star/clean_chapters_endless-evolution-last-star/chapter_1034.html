            <h4>Chapter 1034: Trembling Lock</h4><br><p>At the Fallen Ring Castle, there was plenty of flame and stone, but one thing was missing - trees. Adam didn’t know it, but he missed the sight of ordinary nature rather than caves, or at least anything remotely resembling it.
</p><br><p>Oddly enough, the blood pond was a breath of fresh air for him.
</p><br><p>The scarlet lake was the core of these dangerous hunting grounds. Only the strongest serpents had the right to hunt the regenerative monsters and could return home victorious with their prey rather than die at the paws of the tough creatures.
</p><br><p>However, that was not the only thing in the caves.
</p><br><p>Tall trees with dark bark and twisted roots sat around the lake. A faint, red light emanated from the crystals growing within, like ghostly lanterns releasing a diffuse glow. The trees had no leaves, and their branches sloped downward, covering the dark surface.
</p><br><p>A few monsters among the many immediately noticed the four figures on the edge of their territory.
</p><br><p>Their red bodies of woven muscles trembled slightly, while a dangerous glint passed across their sharp claws. Deep-set eyes, red and, burning stopped on Heret and Vorx for a moment before turning around.
</p><br><p>’Do you know something about them?’ Adam asked his partner.
</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head, and many 3D models of various monsters opened up in front of her. They all looked similar to the ones Adam saw in the distance, but there wasn’t one complete match.
</p><br><p>’No. It seems the blood pond is a limited area that is only connected to the Fallen Ring Castle. I think in this case you should ask the more experienced hunters in this matter.’
</p><br><p>’Yeah, you’re right.’
</p><br><p>Adam smiled weakly as he turned to Heret and Vorx.
</p><br><p>"So, who are we going to hunt, and which of them is pretty strong?"
</p><br><p>Shaking his head, Heret pointed at the skinny monster. Its bones were visible under the stretched skin, its head stretched out and long blades coming out of its hands, in a curved arc reaching to its elbows.
</p><br><p>"These ones we call the Blood Reapers. They’re not the most dangerous guys, but they’re pretty fast. However, you must remember that all the monsters in the blood pond are strong. That’s why only a few serpents had permission to hunt here."
</p><br><p>Adam nodded, then pointed to another monster, big and strong. It had no sharp blades, but its fists were powerful and long fangs protruded from its heavy jaw.
</p><br><p>Heret grinned. "These guys here are smaller, stronger, and their meat... in my opinion, much better! It’s the Blood Hunters!"
</p><br><p>Among the shadows in the distance, Adam spotted a few more regenerative monsters, but for now, he settled on these two.
</p><br><p>In front of the lake, there were several obstacles. The first was an area full of thick blood, framed by tall, dark roots like a well. Many small crystals sprouted along the paths the monsters walked along, occasionally drinking from the well.
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes traveled downward. For some reason, he sensed that beneath the bloody well was something important, something valuable.
</p><br><p>"Is there essence right there?" he asked.
</p><br><br><p>"Yes, just like in all the other important places and especially in the depths of the lake. If you absorb one of those, you’ll cure your arm. You won’t even have to eat a living regenerative monster for that."
</p><br><p>A sly grin was ready to appear on Adam’s face as he stopped himself at the last moment.
</p><br><p>"But, what about you? I’m sure the essence can help you or other serpents become much stronger. After all, for me, it’s simple regeneration, and for you, it will be a great source of energy."
</p><br><p>"Well, you don’t have to worry about that," Heret chuckled as his aura grew more powerful. "We’re on the hunt. Everyone will get what they can catch! If you take the essence from the bottom of the lake, no one has the right to claim it!"
</p><br><p>Without warning, Heret and Vorx’s frames shuddered as they roared forward.
</p><br><p>Adam smiled weakly while Risha’s eyes ran from side to side. She didn’t expect it to start so abruptly.
</p><br><p>"Hey! Wait for me!" she exclaimed as she hurriedly followed him.
</p><br><br><p>Risha jumped down the slope, in the air pulling out the revelation ring and summoning her axe with a bright flash.
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam was in no hurry. He watched with a calm look as Heret’s claws sank into the Blood Hunter’s flesh. Vorx’s flaming fists rained down repeatedly on the Blood Reaper, nailing the frail monster to the wall where it had no chance of escape.
</p><br><p>A slightly confused Risha didn’t know which enemy to choose. In the end, she attacked the nearest Blood Hunter, trying to keep up with the others.
</p><br><p>’You can feel it too, can’t you?’ Adam asked.
</p><br><p>’Oddly enough, yes...’ Silvana muttered, confused. ’It didn’t happen before, but I can feel your energy trembling, flowing through the Evolution Tree. I can feel the Lock shaking.’
</p><br><p>’Hah, Heret mentioned something about that. So I need essences? Damn, the last time I wanted one I fought against the Essence Thunder Demon! That was a fucking long time ago!’
</p><br><p>Silvana smiled bitterly.
</p><br><p>’You were also without an arm that time, well... at the very end. Do you think it’s time to move on to making the final key?
</p><br><p>Adam shrugged, his eyes sweeping along the blood pond looking for his first opponent.
</p><br><p>’Maybe. I don’t know exactly how many essences I’ll need. For now, I just plan to go with the flow. My original goal was to heal my arm, so if the blood pond offers me something interesting, I’ll take it.’
</p><br><br><p>Then, he smoothly jumped down, calmly striding towards the Blood Reaper lurking in the shadows.
</p><br><p>The monster watched closely as Risha, Vorx, and Heret fought. The Blood Reaper had no great desire to help his fellow monsters. In fact, he was waiting for the right moment to devour everyone, monsters and serpents alike.
</p><br><p>Before the Blood Reaper realized it, a shadow from a young man with blue eyes fell on him. The monster turned around, meeting Adam’s slight smile.
</p><br><p>"Hi, I’m sorry, but you’re out of luck. You’ll be my first warm-up after a really worthy opponent!"</p>
