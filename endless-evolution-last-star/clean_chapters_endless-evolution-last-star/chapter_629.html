            <br><p>For Refesa, it was familiar and known; after all, as a free scientist, she had access to secrets that others didn't even know about.</p><br><p>However, the day came when Refesa found out about it, this knowledge didn't just appear in her mind, everyone who wanted to climb to the top had to go through the same way.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana slowly turned to each other, their eyes were wide open, filled with disbelief.</p><br><p>"Wait... What the hell are you talking about?" Adam looked at Refesa, "I'm a Phantom and Silvana is an ordinary human, if my energy ends up in her she'll just die!"</p><br><p>Sure, it wasn't really about the energy, it was about how the energy was applied. If it was a simple amplification, then it wasn't a problem for an ordinary human. But, because the energy was external, temporarily, and even that would greatly exhaust a common person.</p><br><p>If the energy got into the ordinary human, inside, without finding the inner space and Evolution Tree there, the energy would go outward in a chaotic manner, tearing the human's body apart.</p><br><p>Thus, Refesa's words about Gene Diffusion, unknown to them until then, were tantamount to a death sentence for Silvana.</p><br><br><p>Keeping a calm expression on her face, Refesa took a sip of black coffee and glanced at him.</p><br><p>"Hm? Haven't you realized that yet?"</p><br><br><p>"First and foremost Silvana is your Operator, and only then is she an ordinary human, a woman, and so on. Although, you will only be able to say so with complete certainty after the completion of the Gene Diffusion."</p><br><p>Dealing with the first donut, and shaking the crumbs off her hands she pointed at Silvana.</p><br><p>"I'd worry about her if I were you."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, only getting more questions so far.</p><br><p>"Why? I have complete confidence in Silvana, I'm just concerned for her safety."</p><br><p>"I know." Refesa nodded deeply, "Anyone who has read the reports on your missions and your interactions will easily see that. The problem is that the risks are much greater for the Operator."</p><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana entered the conversation, clutching her pants tightly:</p><br><p>"There's no need to try to scare us. I'm prepared for anything. Even if we had problems before, I'm now fully confident that Adam is the only Phantom I'm willing to work with as an Operator."</p><br><br><p>With a wide stride, Refesa found herself directly in front of Silvana, her aquamarine eyes growing much wider, watching for the slightest movements of Silvana's facial muscles.</p><br><p>"Even if you say that, do you believe it? And, even if you do believe it, does it have anything to do with reality?"</p><br><p>Silvana gulped. She didn't want to argue with Refesa, not only because of her status but also due to the tense atmosphere.</p><br><p>Then, as if not wanting to press Silvana any further, Refesa took another donut and waved her hand serenely:</p><br><p>"Anyway, here's the layout: in the event of failure, there are several outcomes."</p><br><p>Refesa raised one finger.</p><br><p>"One, it will be impossible for you, then you are incompatible and your paths as Phantom and Operator will part. Speaking of compatibility, I don't mean physical indicators like genes or DNA, but the mental component."</p><br><p>"The second one is a more advanced first one, but this time if you fail Silvana will die. You'll only end up in the second one if Silvana passes the first stage of the Gene Diffusion."</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Silvana's face turned pale and her eyes went blank.</p><br><br><p>It wasn't at all what she had been thinking about this afternoon, especially death by Adam.</p><br><p>Trying to keep his cool, Adam narrowed his eyes and asked:</p><br><p>"So no risks for the Phantom, while the Operator can die... Somehow that's not fair."</p><br><p>In response, Refesa simply shrugged.</p><br><p>"Well, when you learn more about Gene Diffusion then everything will fall into place. There are reasons for everything."</p><br><p>Recovering from her momentary shock, Silvana took a deep breath and raised her gaze to Refesa.</p><br><p>"You started with failure, but... what happens if you succeed? If among the risks is my death, then we should get something worthy in return in case of success, shouldn't we?"</p><br><p>Not sharing their nervousness and worries, Refesa nodded calmly, eating a second donut.</p><br><p>"Sure. In the case of success, there is only one option, but until you go through Gene Diffusion then I can't tell you more, otherwise I might be to blame for your failure. I don't want that."</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand:</p><br><p>"Wait. What happens if we don't get through Gene Diffusion? I mean, I don't know what we'll get if we succeed, but I don't want to risk Silvana's life."</p><br><p>In a moment, his face grew darker, filling with gloom.</p><br><p>Stay updated through My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"The stakes are too high. I have to know it's necessary, or I won't do it."</p><br><br><p>Silvana gripped Adam's hands tightly, looking at him with a tender gaze.</p><br><p>"Adam... I can handle it, no... we can handle it. Ms. Refesa didn't say anything about the odds of success, which means it's not about luck or circumstances but whether we want to do it or not."</p><br><p>But... her words did not have the desired effect on Adam.</p><br><p>He pulled his hand away from her embrace, glaring menacingly at Refesa.</p><br><p>"No, Silvana, there are always risks. Even leaving the house you run the risk of being hit by a car, but... there are risks we have no control over and there are things we can avoid without any difficulty."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Adam's aura intensified, Silvana and Stina's breathing grew heavier under the palpable pressure, but Refesa didn't react in any way, no emotion appeared on her face.</p><br><p>"Answer me. What is the point of the Gene Diffusion? Why do we do it and why is there such a high level of secrecy around the Gene Diffusion."</p><br><br><p>Taking a loud sip of coffee and setting the cup aside, Refesa simply shrugged.</p><br><p>"Well, if you don't want to, you can leave. No one's forcing Phantom and Operator to go through Gene Diffusion."</p><br><p>Then, Refesa lifted her chin, staring intently at Adam from top to bottom.</p><br><p>"However, in that case, you can forget about getting stronger. Without Gene Diffusion, you can't become a K3-Phantom, ever."</p>
