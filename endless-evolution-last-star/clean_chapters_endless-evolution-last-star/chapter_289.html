            <br><p>Even in the most peaceful times, there were battles, especially if the participants were monsters.</p><br><p>Monsters had a huge number of reasons to fight each other, and sometimes it went beyond 1 on 1 combat.</p><br><p>It required a really good reason. Quite often, monsters could start fighting in a massacre format, where everyone was against everyone and either the strongest or the luckiest survived.</p><br><p>However, much more rarely, another event happened - one group of monsters fought against another. Sometimes it was Nest vs Nest, and sometimes it was just random monsters working together against another group of monsters.</p><br><p>Your next read awaits at m,v -NovelBin.net</p><br><p>Right now, a mixed version was happening in front of Adam and Katrin's eyes, as the huge flaming monsters had a clear goal of destroying the Igno Ants Nest.</p><br><p>'Adam.' Silvana calmly said while going to answer his question, 'From the looks of it, these monsters want to take away the resources that the Igno Ants gathered in their Nest. They are most likely the flame crystals that are deep underground. They are filled with energy and are quite valuable sources of power.'</p><br><p>Adam glanced at the monsters attacking the Igno Ants.</p><br><p>They were seven or even eight meters tall, the size of an entire house each. They had powerful lower legs and long front paws with sharp claws and thick fingers.</p><br><p>Protective scales covered their entire bodies, with liquid flames leaking into the gaps between the scales as if they wanted to burst out and unleash their power.</p><br><p>Their jaws were tough and solid, all to withstand the flame that erupted from them to turn everything in front into a scorched earth. From head to tail, a row of tall growths stretched across their backs, sturdy and strong.</p><br><p>Now and then, the monsters swept their massive tails across the ground, shuddering and raising ash.</p><br><p>'These are Giant Rogoes. Considering their size, they are all Prime Type. It's actually amazing that they agreed to work together. It looks like the Igno Ants have found something really valuable.' Silvana quickly explained.</p><br><p>'Giant Rogo, right?' Adam internally muttered, looking around.</p><br><p>About ten Giant Rogoes had come here for one purpose - to destroy the Igno Ants Nest, and... their numbers could only increase in the future.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A slight tremor of powerful footsteps sounded from two directions as tall shadows with broad shoulders and fiery eyes appeared in the distance.</p><br><p>It was reinforcements, as the Igno Ants were holding the defense for now, but despite their numbers, they would definitely lose soon.</p><br><p>Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.</p><br><p>Hundreds of strong paws of the Igno Ants were rapidly moving across the body of a single Giant Rogo. These monsters were large, but that also meant that they were slow and had trouble getting rid of many smaller opponents.</p><br><p>In fact, given Giant Rogo's body structure, there was no way it could reach its back or neck. Thus, the Igno Ants that snuck into these remote places could unhinderedly tear apart Giant Rogo's scales with their powerful jaws.</p><br><p>Well... If it were that simple, the Igno Ants would have defeated their enemies long ago. They were as good as any ants at fighting against big and strong enemies, turning their quantity into quality.</p><br><p>"ROOOOAAAAAARRRRRR!!!"</p><br><p>Giant Rogo, whose body was covered by Igno Ants, roared furiously, not out of pain or despair, but because he was unleashing his power hidden under his solid armor.</p><br><p>At the same moment, powerful streams of flame rushed from the gaps between its scales, turning the monster into a huge bonfire burning brightly and illuminating everything around it.</p><br><p>The only thing visible through the blazing scarlet flames was a multitude of black dots, quickly falling away from his body and turning into handfuls of ash.</p><br><p>This was the fate of every Igno Ants that climbed Giant Rogo in an attempt to bring the giant down to the ground.</p><br><p>Soon, Giant Rogo calmed down, exhaling a massive club of hot steam from its maw. The monster was breathing heavily, for this attack had cost it a lot of energy and it needed time for the flames beneath its scales to regain power.</p><br><p>Igno Atns like Giant Rogoes were fire monsters like most in the Black Cinder Forest, however, this did not mean they were invulnerable to fire.</p><br><p>Giant Rogoes possessed both superior physical strength and more powerful flames, their only disadvantage over Igno Ants was their numbers and speed. Their fire was capable of burning ants.</p><br><p>"Hm. That's impressive. Silvana, how strong are they? I'm sure they're ranked higher than the Top-20." Adam muttered, looking at the recovering Giant Rogo with interest.</p><br><br><p>'You're right. Prime Giant Rogo is rated as a Top-18. Obviously, it's not the most serious opponent you've faced. However, given that this is their home and there's a lot of fire, their strength might be a bit higher, perhaps their strength level is now Top-15.' Silvana explained in a calm voice.</p><br><p>Adam's corners of his lips went up. He missed Silvana's explanations with her quiet and serious tone.</p><br><p>After all, something like that gave him peace and confidence as well. It didn't matter that he was now standing in the middle of a battle between two groups of monsters. He was fully collected, gaining information and preparing for the battle.</p><br><p>'Hah... This... This is much different from the fight against Thunder Demon. Back then, it was hard to take matters into your own hands and ignore Silvana's screams.'</p><br><p>Then, Adam looked at Katrin, who was holding her palm near her ear with a thoughtful expression. She, like Adam, was listening intently to her Operator.</p><br><p>'Agh... Only over time do we realize how hard it was to go through certain trials. Strangely enough, things seem much more difficult in memory than in action.</p><br><p>Katrin nodded with a deep gaze and glanced at Adam.</p><br><p>"What are we going to do? The Igno Ants are desperate. They brought us here hoping we'd want to kill the Giant Rogoes and it would help them survive."</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes slightly, but not as a threat but to show that none of this was important.</p><br><p>"Do you need something from Giant Rogoes or Igno Ants? I mean, maybe you have a mission on them that you haven't completed yet?" Adam asked in a low voice.</p><br><p>Katrin raised an eyebrow, looking at him with a strange look.</p><br><p>"No. I only came here for the Scarlet Pyromancer."</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Good. Let's leave then, we need to get back to the volcano. Next time we won't let the Igno Ants capture us." Adam waved his hand before heading towards the volcano.</p><br><p>Katrin turned around one last time looking at the hundreds of Igno Ants running out of their anthill in desperate attempts to defend their home before following Adam.</p><br><p>Though there were quite a few differences between them, they were similar in some ways. They pursued their goals first and foremost, so saving the Igno Ants Nest was not on their urgent to-do list.</p><br><p>However... Adam and Katrin were right in the middle of the battle, a hundred meters away from the anthill, so... many already believed that they were involved in the battle.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The ground shook violently, the tremors gradually getting stronger as the source drew closer.</p><br><p>"Damn, looks like we're going to have to stay a while." Katrin tilted her head unhappily looking at the two Giant Rogoes standing in front of them. The monsters glared down at them menacingly from top to bottom.</p><br><p>Adam shook his head as his eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>"Nah. For this mission I am your sword, so don't be afraid to dull my blade."</p>
