            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1322: A Difficult Start</strong></p><br><p>Misty and Karso sent Adam to Norax so that he could help Adam rebuild his Energy Axis. However, Norax had no intention of doing this himself, at least not right now; he had loyal subordinates for that.</p><br><p>It wasn’t that Norax had anything particularly important to do, because as soon as Narica and Adam left his mill, he continued playing video games, but it was too early for him to do that.</p><br><br><p>Adam’s back slammed into the ground, but Narica wasn’t going to stop there. She pounced on him from above, driving her knee deep into his stomach.</p><br><br><p>From the searing pain and force of her strike, Adam practically folded in half as blood gushed from his mouth, falling onto Narica’s calm, pale face.</p><br><p>Those two hits were enough for Adam to realize that Norax wasn’t joking when he ordered Narica to beat him half to death. She was going to do it with all her might, quickly and efficiently, and all Adam could do was try to resist.</p><br><p>Deep down, he knew that Narica was holding back her aura even now and was significantly stronger than he was, so he didn’t stand a chance against her. However, that didn’t mean he was willing to let her just beat him up over and over again.</p><br><br><p>Adam jumped back as he pulled his arm out to the side.</p><br><p>Electric shocks ran through his arm as he stared intently at Narica, who stood amid the dust settling on the ground.</p><br><p>He was ready to summon the Dual Demon Sword, perhaps his strongest weapon at the moment. He had defeated Ureyn with the Dual Demon Sword and hoped to show a decent result against Narica as well.</p><br><p>It was a logical desire, but…</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>The electric shocks suddenly ended without turning into anything. Not even a hilt formed in Adam’s hand, let alone a blade.</p><br><p>“It seems you still don’t understand the situation you’re in, right?” Narica asked, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><br><br><p>“I’m sure, considering how early you woke up, you weren’t even able to stand steadily at first, were you?” She narrowed her eyes.</p><br><p>Adam gulped. Narica couldn’t know this for sure, it was just her assumption, but her voice was firm and confident.</p><br><p>“And you’re trying to use your ability? If I were you, I’d start with the basics of energy control.” She waved her hand dismissively. “Pffft, is it really that hard to understand? What were you hoping for?”</p><br><p>If it weren’t for Adam’s confusion, Narica’s words would have offended him, but at that moment, he was thinking about how to get back even a tiny fraction of his energy.</p><br><br><p>Narica’s frame trembled as she appeared right in front of Adam in the blink of an eye. Before he could react, her hand fell on his face as her nails dug into his skin like claws, causing bloody streaks.</p><br><p>She was ready to launch her next attack when Adam grabbed her wrist tightly with both hands, causing a smirk to appear on her face.</p><br><p>“What? You think that’s enough to break my grip? Damn, I should have watched your fight myself. I don’t understand how you could have defeated Ureyn. That young man is a true talent of our lands, not like…”</p><br><p>A sharp pain shot through Narica’s arm as, with a furious expression, she threw Adam aside like a piece of trash.</p><br><br><p>He crashed into a dry log, but managed to stay on his feet despite the splinters flying in all directions.</p><br><p>“You… What did you do…?” Narica muttered in disbelief as she slowly lowered her gaze.</p><br><p>Blood was flowing from her wrist, but not from a cut or anything like that, no, just from the side where a small piece of her flesh was now missing.</p><br><br><p>With a great grimace, Adam swallowed a piece of Narica’s flesh, her skin, blood, and muscles, as well as her energy.</p><br><p>“Shit, I’ve never tasted anything more disgusting.” His face twisted in disgust, but he didn’t spit out a single drop because he understood how important it was.</p><br><p>At that moment, Narica finally understood what Adam was trying to do with such a wild move.</p><br><p>“Wait, you want to absorb my energy?” she asked as her face paled.</p><br><p>Adam brushed the blood from his mouth.</p><br><p>“Yeah, it works with the Regenerative Monsters, so it should work with you as well, right?”</p><br><p>“No! Spit out my blood right now!” she exclaimed. “You’re too weak right now to even use your abilities, let alone absorb energy from my blood! Damn it! You’re an idiot!”</p><br><p>In response, Adam grinned and poked himself in the chest.</p><br><p>“I’m not an idiot. I’m a winner! And…!”</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam’s heart clenched with sharp pain, beginning to beat at a frantic pace. His face contorted with pain as he fell to his knees, clutching his chest.</p><br><p>“GHR!” With a painful groan, he gritted his teeth, while true chaos ensued in his inner space.</p><br><p>All the energy from Narica’s blood went straight to the Evolution Tree, penetrating through countless cracks in its bark that had not yet recovered after absorbing the Connected Heart.</p><br><p>His Evolution Tree was at its limit because the energy was at its maximum, but the Energy Axis did not allow it to reach the top, so that Adam could freely use it as usual.</p><br><p>Now, there was too much energy, like trying to pour water into an already full bottle.</p><br><br><p>This caused the front tips of the Energy Axis to tremble, absorbing all the external energy to pass it through many threads and thus relieve the pressure and save Adam.</p><br><p>In the end, the Energy Axis was Adam’s ally that protected him from the pressure that could break him, not his enemy.</p><br><p>The white and gold threads vibrated more and more intensely and shone brighter, as if they were wires under high temperature, causing them to connect one after another to survive this critical moment.</p><br><p>Watching from the top of his mill, Norax grinned and continued playing.</p><br><p>“Hah, has the first stage already begun? I think now Narica will understand why this guy will defeat Ureyn. He’s not afraid to lose, that’s all.”</p>
