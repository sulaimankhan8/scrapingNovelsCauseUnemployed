            <br><br><p>Slowly, taking his time, Adam climbed the spiral staircase running up the outside of the spire, eager to reach the top.</p><br><p>The blue arrow remained his guide until he arrived at his goal. He was following the rules and the External Artifact wasn't going to break them either.</p><br><p>His journey was a long one. The steps were numerous and short as if they were a challenge in themselves.</p><br><p>Nevertheless, Adam felt neither irritation nor exhaustion as he had a beautiful view in front of him - the Lands of the Lone Serpent, the name of the area around the fortress.</p><br><p>There was nothing of note nearby, just a surface of black sand and the occasional majestic trees. However, outside of this area not connected to the fortress in any way, there were other ones, as throughout all the Wild Lands.</p><br><p>From his vantage point, despite the great height, Adam couldn't see it, but he sensed and knew that not so far away were other Phantoms who were fighting monsters, perhaps right now.</p><br><p>"Agh, if you think about it like that, going only on the most dangerous and difficult missions and losing the charm of the ordinary, you could say routine missions. It's too late to think about that though."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged leaning against the wall as he crossed his arms over his chest, looking out at the enticing landscape.</p><br><p>The blue arrow was about to go on, but seeing that Adam stopped it came back and started nervously darting in front of him.</p><br><p>With a wave of his hand, Adam tossed the blue arrow aside as if getting rid of a pesky fly.</p><br><p>"Hey, give me a little rest. I'm not going anywhere, I'm just taking a short pause."</p><br><p>For some reason, deep inside Adam felt pride being in a dangerous proximity to arrogance.</p><br><p>He was here in the Red Zone and successfully defeated all the opponents in his path, while other Phantoms of the same level as him were fighting close to the fortress but rather weak places.</p><br><p>"Hmm, there's nothing wrong with recognizing one's achievements, right?"</p><br><p>Oddly enough, it wasn't just a monologue and Silvana realized it:</p><br><p>'Sure, if you have to choose between self-confidence and insecurity, the first one is always better. But, Adam, never be overconfident, please.'</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly, casting one last glance at the high hills in the distance.</p><br><p>"Well, I can't promise anything. I'm human and my arrogance will continue to grow, exactly until someone strong enough comes along and punches me in the face."</p><br><p>There was only silence on the other side. Silvana bit her lip, she understood what Adam meant, but she didn't accept it.</p><br><p>After enjoying the view and a moment of peace, Adam took a deep breath and headed onward, soon finishing his climb to the very top of the spire.</p><br><br><p>After a few final steps, his foot stepped onto a platform, with a brightly burning blue flame in the center. Something was lurking within the flame, but he couldn't make out what it was, only an elongated shadow.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam's opponent was already waiting for him, or rather a powerful silhouette was waiting for anyone who was led here by the blue arrow.</p><br><p>"Hmm... So my opponent is you, right?"</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes as he stared intently at the silhouette sitting on the edge of the spire with its back turned to Adam.</p><br><p>Unlike a Mighty Commander or even a Solitary Commander, that one looked much more human, a clear sign that it was a Crown Type.</p><br><p>The monster was dressed in simple clothes torn in many places, fluttering in the strong, cold wind that blew across the top of the spire, next to the tall pillars that supported the upper peak.</p><br><p>Though the monster still sat cross-legged, Adam easily analyzed its physical attributes.</p><br><p>'He's pretty short, his muscles are barely visible, outwardly he doesn't look much better than the Shadow Walkers, but...'</p><br><p>Adam glanced around, watching the barely perceptible shivering in the air, the tiny rips appearing in an attempt to return to normal.</p><br><p>'That just shows how strong he is.'</p><br><p>Even though Adam hadn't yet started the battle against this monster, he was fully confident that one was stronger than the Solitary Commander and the Mighty Commander. That was what his mind and instincts were telling him.</p><br><p>Suddenly, the monster turned around, looking at Adam over his shoulder, though... it was unknown if the monster saw him. His head was wrapped tightly in wide, tattered bandages, just like the last, third statue.</p><br><p>The Solitary Commander and the Mighty Commander had weapons for the two statues, but they didn't look like statues, unlike this one.</p><br><p>"Well, well... Let me guess, the Blind Commander?" Adam suggested with a slight irony in his voice.</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply.</p><br><p>'Yes, but I should warn you, the Blind Commanders aren't ordinary monsters.'</p><br><p>"Yeah, I see... He's the Crown Type." Adam shrugged. This wasn't the first time he faced that type of monster.</p><br><p>'No, that's not it. The Blind Commanders are quite rare and they usually choose places like this fortress.'</p><br><p>"Hm? What do you mean?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>The Blind Commander clearly heard what Adam was saying, but he didn't interrupt him, just stared silently at his would-be adversary.</p><br><p>'They choose locations where they can take the highest position while minding their own business, that is, they are quite willful. Naturally, they are aided by various External Artifacts, and this case is no exception, they are valuable fighters.'</p><br><p>Then, Silvana's voice became more serious.</p><br><p>'Although the Blind Commander is a Crown Type, they like other Crown Monsters can look far from human size and body parts... Such a small size and powerful aura is very rare.'</p><br><p>Experience more content on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam understood everything as he smiled widely.</p><br><p>"Hah, I see your point. Like the Prime Stone Mimic below, he's special even among his own, with his kind being someone like arrogant hermits - do nothing but the most dangerous. Am I saying this right?"</p><br><br><p>As if realizing that they were done with their conversation, the Blind Commander waved his hand indicating the empty seat beside him.</p><br><br><p>The monster didn't want to fight, he wanted to enjoy the scenery, at least for these last few seconds.</p>
