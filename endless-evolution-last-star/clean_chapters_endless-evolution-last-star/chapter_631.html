            <br><p>Looking around, to see only countless white slabs that hid hundreds of artifacts behind them, Adam slowly stepped forward.</p><br><p>"But... How? How does this work? Can ordinary people use artifacts?" Adam was stumped.</p><br><p>Refesa carelessly waved her hand heading along with Stina to the other room. It was dangerous for them to stay here, as it was only safe outside the White Cube. Unfortunately for Silvana, that option was not possible.</p><br><p>"I already told you that I'm just exploiting them. I'm not a Phantom, I can't absorb an artifact, bind it to the Evolution Tree, and use the abilities. Moreover, there are over a hundred artifacts here."</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Refesa continued:</p><br><p>"The process is long, as these artifacts have been completely depleted so that the energy within them won't cause anomalies, otherwise stability is out of the question. Anyway, don't worry, we'll be fine, the artifacts will absorb all your energy in the explosion."</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyebrows, frowned heavily, and placed a hand on Silvana's shoulder, hugging her tightly.</p><br><p>"Pffft, I'm not worried about your safety, and... there won't be any explosion!"</p><br><p>Before exiting White Cube, Refesa turned around looking at him over her shoulder, a sly smile on her face:</p><br><p>"Do you have any idea how many times I've heard that? Hah, I've seen dozens of Phantoms and Operators confident in each other, and then... all that was left in the hands of the Phantoms were chunks of flesh and rivers of blood flowing through their fingers." Read exclusive content at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Without saying anything else, Refesa closed the door, disappearing into a special room that like everything in the White Cube was protected by slabs of artifacts.</p><br><p>Her words left Adam and Silvana with pale faces. They already knew the risks, so they realized that Refesa wasn't lying to them - this actually happened as a matter of fact.</p><br><p>Then, Adam turned to Silvana.</p><br><p>"Are you sure about this? I mean... There's a big difference between the two options for failure, but either way, if we don't succeed, our paths will part."</p><br><p>Adam seemed to say it too easily, but it wasn't so. He realized that Gene Diffusion was a serious affair and for their future together as Phantom and Operator they had to do it or Adam would never reach K3-Level.</p><br><p>Remaining silent for a few seconds, Silvana cast an irritated glance at Adam.</p><br><p>"Hmm? I think I've already told you everything. We'll do it today!"</p><br><p>Then, she walked over to Adam and poked a finger into his chest.</p><br><p>"Tomorrow you're going into the Dead Lands to break your First Wall. You've been standing on one level for too long and... same goes for me. All right, let's get to work!"</p><br><p>With fiery confidence in her gaze, Silvana turned around, walking out into the center of the White Cube.</p><br><p>"What do we do next? How do we start the Gene Diffusion?"</p><br><p>Refesa's room had a sophisticated panel, she could control the White Cube, listen and see them as well as talk to them at any moment.</p><br><p>"There's nothing complicated about it. After all, Gene Diffusion is a natural evolutionary mechanism, it wasn't invented by humans. We just adapted it for usability and to increase the chance of success."</p><br><p>Directing her gaze at Adam, Refesa slowly said:</p><br><p>"Come to the center, sit against each other, Adam you can take Silvana's hand if you wish, but it's not necessary, it's for your mutual peace of mind."</p><br><p>Exchanging glances, Adam and Silvana nodded, then they did as Refesa said, their deep eyes looking at each other with slight excitement inside.</p><br><p>"Good." Refesa nodded, "Now it's simple. Adam, start releasing your energy. You have to do it until you're so exhausted you pass out."</p><br><p>Uncertainty showed on Adam's frowning face. He understood that energy without form or purpose wouldn't hurt Silvana, but something else confused him.</p><br><p>"Wait, you said it is a natural process. Then why are you giving us instructions?"</p><br><p>"I'm just giving you a hint. If you focus, you'll figure out for yourself what you need to do and... I think something like this happened once before, but you just don't remember it."</p><br><p>Not intending to waste any more time, Adam bit his lip and nodded deeply. As Refesa had suggested, he took Silvana's hand firmly, soon his aura became much stronger, exerting a light but tangible pressure on Silvana.</p><br><p>Before turning off the microphone, Refesa gave them one last piece of advice:</p><br><p>"Even if you are willing and able to go through this ordeal, don't think it will be easy. And, you will be changed forever, maybe for the worse and possibly for the better."</p><br><p>Refesa said nothing more becoming a silent observer along with Stina, who had been standing behind her the whole time. It was a rewarding experience for her, as every scientist had a dream at some point to get close to Refesa's level.</p><br><p>It required not only knowledge and talent but also experience and open secrets.</p><br><p>Ripple. Ripple. Ripple.</p><br><p>Calm, snow-white streams of energy emanating from Adam's body, occasionally trembling like a water surface, slowly covered both him and Silvana.</p><br><p>If Adam had wanted to and put some emotion or aura into his energy he could hurt Silvana badly, since she was a simple human, but... he wouldn't ever do such a thing.</p><br><p>The more energy drained from Adam the weaker he became.</p><br><p>When the Phantom is deprived of all the energy that his Evolution Tree can release, nothing bad happens, the Phantom just passes out from exhaustion, after a while he awakes and everything returns to normal.</p><br><p>His eyes gradually lost their rich blue color, becoming faded sapphires, gray bags formed below as if he hadn't slept for a long time and his heart began to beat slower unlike Silvana's one, she was confident in her choice but still nervous.</p><br><p>After a few minutes, it was impossible to see their silhouette, only dark outlines behind the white veil.</p><br><p>And... in a moment, Adam closed his eyes, lowering his head - his powers ran out.</p><br><p>Then, the energy headed towards Silvana making her green eyes shine brightly like stars.</p>
