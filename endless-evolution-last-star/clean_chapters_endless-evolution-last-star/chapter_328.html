            <br><p>Adam knew how to use Spirit to its full potential, he had learned how to summon the second stage in Fall Hill Prison and had since seen The Will used by many Phantoms as well as what their Spirits looked like.</p><br><p>Some monsters used their auras in front of Adam as well, it was less frequent but he had experience.</p><br><p>Adam had noticed that the first stage Spirit, was always depicted in the form of a weapon. Even in his case, it was like that. His first stage Spirit looked like a needle, which had been his primary weapon from the very first day of being a Phantom until now.</p><br><p>Thus, Adam decided that the skull hovering above Plague Reaper was nothing more than his second-stage Spirit. It was logical because this skull was more like an essence and a silhouette, which was a clear sign of the second stage, than a weapon.</p><br><p>But... as it turned out, he was very wrong.</p><br><p>Silvana, who was watching what was happening experienced a real horror from Plague Reaper's aura. Fortunately for her, she couldn't feel its effects, otherwise she would have already passed out or possibly been dead.</p><br><p>She as an ordinary person wouldn't have been able to resist Plague Reaper's aura even for a single moment, and the internal damage from an aura of such power would be enough to make her heart explode.</p><br><p>'Holy shit... His Spirit looks like death itself, though... what else would you expect from Plague Reaper?' Silvana gulped, as she got really stressed out.</p><br><p>She began actively biting her nails, feeling very nervous and worried about Adam's future.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The massive snow-white sword trembled and soon, simply turned to nothing under the superior power of the Plague Reaper that spread around like death.</p><br><p>'What? His first stage Spirit had to spend some time dealing with an ordinary sword, but that one, which is much stronger than the past ones, he destroyed that sword in just an instant!' Adam inwardly exclaimed while clenching his teeth.</p><br><br><p>Soon, a new wave of dark flame reached them, not from the skull, but from the silhouette with scythe. This flame was not as aggressive and active as the previous one, but it was only getting scarier.</p><br><p>"Argh!!!" Adam felt as if massive chains had fallen on his shoulders, trying to nail him to the ground.</p><br><p>In just a few seconds, the Plague Reaper's aura was able to destroy part of Adam's aura. The white threads of his Spirit, simply couldn't handle the black flames and burned away, turning into nothingness.</p><br><p>"I'll help you!" Oskar exclaimed vigorously before swinging his arm. His aura wasn't as strong as Adam's, but if they tried to block Plague Reaper's aura together, they could stop this threat.</p><br><br><p>The golden sword, along with its flames, headed towards Adam's Spirit, getting in front of the silver threads in an attempt to shield them from the harmful effects of Death's aura.</p><br><br><p>Cracks ran down the golden sword, as a massive shard flew aside, turning to dust.</p><br><p>Oskar frowned heavily, this damage to his Spirit reflected with a painful thump in his chest. He was able to withstand it, but it showed that he couldn't help Adam.</p><br><p>Katrin was in the same position, her Spirit was not powerful enough.</p><br><p>'No, no, no. If this continues any further, we will all suffer serious internal damage. If that happens then we definitely won't stand a chance of winning against him!' Adam exclaimed internally, gritting his teeth hard and glaring at Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>Adam stared at Plague Reaper burning him with his gaze, showing that he wasn't going to give up, not in this situation.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper raised his eyebrow slightly as if showing a slight interest in Adam's will and intentions. In his worldview, though, none of that mattered if it couldn't be backed up by force.</p><br><br><p>Piece by piece, thread by thread, the dark flames were destroying Adam's Spirit, having already consumed a third of his Spirit.</p><br><p>A little more and the plague flames would reach the main body of Adam's Spirit, and then his aura defenses would fall. At this rate, it would definitely happen very soon.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, something touched Adam's shoulder.</p><br><p>Throwing a quick glance he saw Osana standing behind him, who was smiling slightly despite the tense situation.</p><br><p>'What...? Why is she acting so relaxed? Doesn't she realize what will happen if I lose in this battle of auras?' Adam thought, puzzled and even a little scared by Osana's motives.</p><br><p>"Surely now you're wondering why I'm not worried?" Osana smirked, "Well, it's because I've seen enough. You're surprisingly strong. You lose to him a bit, but that's not a problem. After all, Plague Reaper is the strongest one that K1-Phantoms like us can face." Osana said softly before taking a deep breath.</p><br><p>At the same moment, an active blue field began to emanate from her, which quickly transformed into a tall lady with an extremely wide skirt and long thick hair reaching to her knees.</p><br><p>A pink glow emanated from this lady as if from Osana herself, whose hair had this delicate color.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide. He knew that Osana had a rather powerful aura since she was the only one who didn't flinch in front of Scarlet Pyromancer's aura, but he didn't expect that she could use second-stage Spirit.</p><br><p>'Wait... If she could summon her Spirit all this time, why didn't she do it sooner?' Adam was baffled and outraged. He thought that Osana had not taken their hard-fought battle seriously.</p><br><p>That was not the case at all, for Osana's Spirit was not powerful on its own, but only in alliance with someone like herself.</p><br><br><p>The lady took a step forward, approaching Adam's faceless creature, before hugging it tightly from the back, pressing her delicate hands to its chest covered with hundreds of threads, and leaning her head against its shoulder, like two lovers who had to fight together for their lives.</p><br><p>Then, as if at the behest of the hearts of these nonexistent beings, Osana's aura traveled towards Adam's, bringing to his white flame pink streams that saturated his aura, strengthening it and healing it.</p><br><p>"Hmm...? Is this actually happening?" Adam muttered in disbelief, watching as the threads of his Spirit grew longer and separated, creating a new weapon in the fight against the aura of death, against the plague itself.</p><br><p>"Sure. Now just concentrate and use my aura as if it belonged to you. I give you complete control over my Spirit. This will continue as long as my Spirit hugs yours tightly." Osana whispered with a sly smile on her face.</p><br><p>Adam didn't know what was causing Osana to have this reaction, but he wasn't about to look into it, after all, her help was key.</p><br><p>'Yeah... Thanks to her aura, everything will change. Plague Reaper's aura can still destroy mine...' Adam glanced at the black flame particles that had consumed several threads, 'But now I can counterattack without worrying that my Spirit will be destroyed because Osana's aura heals and supports me.'</p><br><p>Then, Adam glanced at his Spirit and pointed his hand forward.</p><br><p>His Spirit instantly responded to his call and brought his right hand, which was holding a silver needle tightly, to attack.</p><br><p>The tip of the needle shone brightly, attracting not only some of the white flames but also the pink streams coming from Osana's Spirit, making it a truly formidable weapon in the confrontation between the two auras.</p>
