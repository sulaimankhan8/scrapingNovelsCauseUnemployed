            <br><p>"Tsk. I didn't think we'd have to take advantage of his weakness to win." Krana frowned, spitting out a clot of blood.</p><br><p>Trana took a deep breath, trying to strengthen his aura as much as possible.</p><br><p>"There's no need to think about it. We just need to defeat him, that's all. He's not an easy opponent, I'm willing to admit that. However, I'm not going to lose!" Trana exclaimed as a stream of pink aura emerged from her body.</p><br><p>Krana smirked as she looked at her younger sister. Although they looked similar and even had the same Initial Gene, their personalities were vastly different.</p><br><p>"Fine, I'll support you. As always." Krana smiled bitterly before casting a glance at Adam.</p><br><p>He stood motionless in place, holding his needle tightly. From time to time, there was a dangerous gleam along the silver threads, showing that Adam was on full alert.</p><br><p>"You wanted us to use the power of auras, didn't you? You were able to get us to do it, you can be proud. However, for someone who doesn't know how to use auras, it's a fatal mistake!" Krana shouted before releasing her aura.</p><br><p>At the same moment, green and blue flames shuddered, quickly transforming into silhouettes above Krana and Trana.</p><br><p>Adam had only seen something like this once before - when Prago had attacked him, transforming his aura into a flower monster.</p><br><p>'Oh... So this is what their auras look like in full form... It's different from the weapons that attacked me before.' Adam pondered, looking at the tall silhouettes.</p><br><p>Long, tattered coats covered the silhouettes, as well as bandages hiding the faces of the strange monsters Krana and Trana had summoned. The silhouettes had only one hand each, holding an old, rusty scythe as if taken from death itself.</p><br><p>Adam was wary. A chill ran down his spine. It seemed that Krana and Trana's auras could have easily ended this fight.</p><br><p>"No argument there. Your physical stats are strong, and thanks to your needle, you can fight even without Nexus. I have to admit that if you had the power of your aura, there's nothing we could do to you." Krana said calmly before extending her hand forward.</p><br><p>"But... That's just my guess, and the reality is much harsher, especially for you!"</p><br><p>At the same moment, Krana and Trana's silhouettes simultaneously shifted from their spots, lunging at Adam.</p><br><p>Krana and Trana didn't move as they concentrated all their strength on controlling auras. This was their main advantage against Adam, and they had to use their full potential.</p><br><p>Perhaps Adam should have used his artifact now and quickly gotten to Krana and Trana, attacked them, and prevented them from using their auras, but... that wasn't what Adam wanted.</p><br><p>He desired them to attack him with their auras from the start, so he had to answer them in return!</p><br><p>'Agh... I might be making a mistake, but this is the fastest way to learn the aura power.' Adam inwardly sighed before clenching his fists tightly - in one burst, letting all of his aura out.</p><br><p>Adam's aura, as before, was simply a white flame - the initial form of aura that every Phantom possessed.</p><br><p>The only difference from the auras of other Phantoms that could not use the aura power was that Adam's aura was denser, more intense, and rich in bloody battle experience.</p><br><p>That allowed him to suppress the aura of other Phantoms, but only if they didn't know how to use their auras as well as he did.</p><br><br><p>Silhouettes, swung their scythed, cutting through the outer and middle layers of Adam's aura with ease.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide since he hadn't expected the silhouettes to be so strong, since even Edir's aura axe needed some time to reach the middle layer!</p><br><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.</p><br><p>Edir devoured the caramel popcorn without stopping, crunching happily.</p><br><p>"Hehehe, either he's going to lose in agony now and stay here for a long time, or he's going to reduce his sentence by several times today. Which do you think will happen?" Edir smirked, glancing at Lola.</p><br><p>Lola looked away with puffed-up cheeks.</p><br><p>"If you want me to answer that, you'll have to share the popcorn first!" Lola snorted irritably.</p><br><p>Edir rolled his eyes, handing over the nearly empty box.</p><br><p>Lola's eyes glazed over like a child who finally got the desired yummy treat. MVLeMpYr-official-text</p><br><p>"I think Adam will win!" Lola exclaimed vigorously.</p><br><p>"Agh..." Edir took a deep breath, "It would be nice, but he doesn't seem to understand what he needs to do."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The silhouettes continued to cut through Adam's aura with their scythes, soon they reached his shoulders, thrusting the sharp blades straight into Adam's body!</p><br><p>"ARGHHHHHHH!!!" Adam cried out in pain, falling to one knee and grabbing his wounded shoulder.</p><br><p>Krana and Trana glanced over, wide grins appearing on their faces. Though they hadn't originally wanted to take advantage of their opponent's weakness so brazenly, they had no other choice.</p><br><p>Now, all they had to do was watch as Adam gritted his teeth, trying not to scream in pain while the transparent blades cut him from the inside.</p><br><p>The aura scythes of the silhouettes did not directly harm him physically, for his clothes were intact, as well as his skin, but his inner space was suffering, which was already affecting his organs and flesh from the inside out.</p><br><p>'Come on! I can't take it much longer! If they can master their auras, then so can I!' Adam inwardly exclaimed, trying to convince his Evolution Tree or something else to act, he didn't know which part of his powers he needed to appeal to.</p><br><p>Edir shook his head. He understood what Adam was doing, and he knew it was wrong.</p><br><p>'Agh... You shouldn't ask your power to help you... after all, it's not a separate entity or personality, it's a part of you...' Edir internally muttered, 'You should control it just like any part of your body. You don't ask your hand to clench into a fist, do you? You just...'</p><br><p>Suddenly, Adam's gaze changed to that of a cornered beast - desperate and extremely dangerous.</p><br><p>Then, he forgot about the pain and roared:</p><br><p>"Whoever or whatever you are, destroy these ghosts! I order to you!"</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>At the same moment, all the branches of his Evolution Tree sparkled, releasing white-hot streams of energy - just like the threads in his Initial Gene.</p><br><p>The energy quickly turned into a massive circle covering the entire Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>For a while, the center was empty, but soon, a massive silver needle appeared - slightly blurred, as if it hadn't fully formed yet.</p><br><p>But... the outer part of the circle was solid and complete, it was ready to begin fighting!</p><br><p>[The Aura Seal had been created!]</p><br><p>Adam heard the familiar mechanical voice that always appeared when he became stronger. Instinctively, it brought a sly smile to his face.</p><br><p>[The Aura Seal is not yet complete, so you can only use the initial form of your power.]</p><br><p>[Activate your The Will to order your aura to act!]</p><br><p>Then, Adam stretched his hand forward as his eyes shone brightly, deep in his pupils appeared silver threads capable of cutting through anything.</p><br><br><p>His aura transformed into a massive silver needle that ripped the ghosts apart in a single motion.</p>
