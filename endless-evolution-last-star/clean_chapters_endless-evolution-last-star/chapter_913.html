            <br><p>People usually used high-speed trains to get from one ring to another. It took varying amounts of time, but it usually took thirty minutes to an hour. This short time was due to the speed of the train and the fact that they traveled directly without wasting time on stops or turns.</p><br><p>Those who didn't want to be in a big hurry used cars. It was not as fast, but it was possible to get from the Third Ring to the First Ring in a few hours if you traveled on special roads.</p><br><p>But... Erik wasn't going to spend that much time on their way.</p><br><p>The tunnel he was driving through provided the shortest way from the seventh wing to the Third Ring.</p><br><p>His car was traveling at seemingly impossible speeds even for sports cars built for racing.</p><br><p>And, Adam soon realized what the reason was.</p><br><p>"Mr. Erik... This car. Was it built at the Iron Observatory?" he speculated.</p><br><p>"Hah, and you guessed it pretty quickly. This car was custom built at the factory, but right after that I sent it to the Iron Observatory for Refesa to personally handle its modernization."</p><br><p>He waved his hand, continuing to pick up speed. The lamps at the top and sides of the tunnel had long since turned into solid lines of light, quivering with distortion.</p><br><p>"A favor like this isn't something you can buy with money. It requires something more than that - power. However, I assure you, Refesa was generously rewarded for her work."</p><br><p>Silvana inwardly gasped trying to remain calm outwardly.</p><br><p>'Wow... So, free scientists work directly with the heads of great families?' Silvana internally muttered, 'Hmm, can any of them know what Aiden Henk is doing? It's complicated.'</p><br><br><p>Nine minutes and soon seconds later, Erik came to an abrupt halt. Unlike the beginning of the tunnel, there was no platform here that could lift him up.</p><br><p>"Alright, we're almost there. We'll have to walk a bit from here on out. Follow me." Erik threw on his coat and headed outside.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana glanced over, then they nodded slightly.</p><br><p>Heading up the old stairs, they stepped out into an alleyway from an old building, an unremarkable one, one of the thousands filling the Third Ring and the slums.</p><br><p>Coming out of the dark alley, lit only by the bright moon, they stopped.</p><br><p>"Here." Erik pointed ahead, at a massive building one block ahead.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment, he knew what this building was.</p><br><p>It was one of the many warehouses where supplies were brought in and out around the clock, bound for both the stores of the Third Ring and the slums, especially the Yellow Shark, the most popular chain of stores in the slums.</p><br><p>How did Adam know about this?</p><br><p>Well, like any child in the slums, he walked to the border between the slums and the Third Ring many times in his childhood. He had seen the houses, the streets, and the infrastructure of the Third Ring which was many times better than the slums.</p><br><p>Naturally he knew where the food came from in the stores as he watched the trucks transporting goods, sometimes even thinking of stealing it, but in the end he didn't dare to do it. The risks were too high compared to the rewards.</p><br><p>Overall, he was just curious and had a desire for a better life.</p><br><p>"Wait..." Adam stammered, "You mean every warehouse has a descent at the Lower Ring, isn't that too dangerous?"</p><br><p>Erik shook his head, a bitter smile on his face, "Oh, you silly boy. Of course not. There are dozens of such warehouses on the borders of the zones, but only four special ones. Moreover, as you can see this warehouse is working even now, late at night."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, he watched as two trucks drove out from the east side, a minute later one truck came from the west side disappearing into the massive depot.</p><br><p>"Those trucks contain no food at all, well... food is there too, but only a small portion. Through warehouses like this supplies from the Lower Ring to the Upper Ring and even the First Ring directly to the government or military in their forts. It all depends on the order and the need at the time."</p><br><p>Baffled, Adam turned around with narrowed eyes staring at Erik, "What? Supplies from the Lower Ring? But, isn't the Lower Ring one big slum? I mean... I'm sure there are rich and powerful people there, but what does the Lower Ring have to offer that the Upper Ring doesn't?"</p><br><p>At the same moment, something strange happened to Erik. In a lone burst, an aura came out of his body making his silhouette much taller than it was. Dark red energy, like flames, came out of his figure, while his narrowed crimson eyes looked down at Adam's from above with a devious smirk.</p><br><p>"Oh, Adam, my boy. You have no idea how much the Lower and the Upper rings are tied together. Supplies? Hah, there could be a lot of stuff in them and if the first thing you thought of was drugs, you're right, but... It's the most harmless and cheapest thing riding in those dark trucks."</p><br><p>Erik chuckled briefly, the darkness filling his voice making Silvana shiver - only now did she truly feel how terrifying the Second Rank Phantom could be, who didn't hold back his power.</p><br><p>The last time she and Adam had felt something like that was from Gladius.</p><br><p>"Well, you'll find out soon enough. I'm sure you'll have to if you want to meet Wilfred and the Black Swan. But if you're so curious, consider this-"</p><br><p>Erik's aura returned to normal, he stepped forward, over his shoulder casting a sharp glance at Adam.</p><br><p>"The Upper Ring, for you as for many who live here, is the whole Citadel. It's a huge place with millions of people living there and tens of thousands of buildings functioning. Where do you think all the materials come from to build this sanctuary in our cruel world?</p><br><p>"Where do the resources come from to generate electricity, keep warm, and equip an army? Sure, you could say a lot of it comes from the Dead Lands, and you'd be right, but that's only partially true."</p><br><p>Then, Erik waved his coat, beckoning the shocked Adam and Silvana to follow him - straight to the Hollow Spot.</p>
