            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1375: Path of Desire</strong></p><br><p>Clang. Clang. Clang.</p><br><p>For some time now, Adam and the Silver Weaver had been appearing and disappearing on the battlefield like two flashes, bringing destruction with them.</p><br><p>If there had been other monsters or Phantoms here, they would have hurried to get as far away as possible so as not to get in the way of these two, which would have been fatal for them.</p><br><p>It was obvious that Adam had become stronger. The Silver Weaver could no longer dominate the battlefield, and from time to time, he missed several attacks, as evidenced by the cuts on his chest, shoulders, and one long cut on his pale cheek.</p><br><p>Adam was also wounded, but all of that was nothing compared to the gap in his heart. Once his energy ran out, so would his life. So, only victory was his path to salvation, but he wasn’t thinking about that now.</p><br><p>“More, more, more!” Adam exclaimed inwardly before swinging with the second needle. “He almost missed. If I act even faster, I can definitely defeat him!”</p><br><br><p>His frame shook as he vanished, reappearing right in front of his opponent, but the Silver Weaver was ready for this as their two needles clashed again.</p><br><p>“Is that all?” The Silver Weaver asked with a haughty look. “I was sure you were capable of more. Was I wrong?”</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could respond, the Silver Weaver’s fist slammed into Adam’s stomach, knocking him back.</p><br><p>“Enough of these games!” The Silver Weaver waved his hand majestically as streams of energy flowed toward his needle. “What is this? Two needles? Who even decided that was a good idea? You only need one needle, just like your path!”</p><br><br><p>Adam spat out a mouthful of blood as he rose from the ground.</p><br><p>His hands trembled slightly from the strain, but biting his lip, he returned to his senses.</p><br><p>“Tsk, what could you possibly know about my abilities? My two needles have brought me many victories, especially now that they have become stronger!”</p><br><p>This did not impress the Silver Weaver as his eyes remained as cold as ever.</p><br><br><p>He raised his needle high above his head, holding the hilt with both hands while streams of energy filled the blade with great power.</p><br><p>“Then I’ll have to show you that what you use is only an illusion of real power. When you realize this, you’ll be surprised at how foolish you’ve been.”</p><br><p>Adam didn’t know what meaning lay behind the Silver Weaver’s words, but he understood that he had to act right now and respond to the Silver Weaver’s attack.</p><br><p>‘This… Shit, I can’t stop this with the second needle. I have to respond with the same attack!’</p><br><p>Hastily, Adam joined the two needles as the three energies became one. White, black, and gold flames burst forth from the great needle, rushing over Adam’s shoulders as he gathered all the energy in one point before raising his needle just as the Silver Weaver had done.</p><br><p>At the same time, they brought down their needles as two blades burst forth.</p><br><p>The silver blade collided with the white one, and for a split second, they fought each other like waves trying to overwhelm their enemy, until the white blade shuddered and tore the silver one apart.</p><br><p>“W-What…?” Adam’s voice trembled in disbelief as the white blade reached him.</p><br><p>It all happened too fast for him to react as blood gushed from his chest, covering the gray ground in front of him.</p><br><br><p>Adam fell as his pupils trembled in an attempt to understand what had just happened.</p><br><br><p>He clenched his fists, sand digging under his nails as all his muscles tried to lift him.</p><br><p>‘No, this can’t be. But… what else can I do? I used everything, absolutely everything I had!’</p><br><p>Thoughts filled Adam’s mind in chaotic order, but he had no time at all.</p><br><br><p>A slight tremor ran through the ground from the Silver Weaver’s footsteps.</p><br><p>Adam turned as the Silver Weaver got closer and closer with each step, like death itself. What’s more, his energy was coming to an end. In less than a minute, his reserves would be depleted, and he would die of exhaustion.</p><br><p>“Stop…” Adam said to himself as his mind obeyed him.</p><br><p>All his countless thoughts and plans disappeared, leaving him alone with the darkness.</p><br><p>Now, he could finally see the lone star that had always been with him, but which he had forgotten about lately.</p><br><p>This was influenced by both the Energy Axis and a series of battles where other abilities proved to be more effective.</p><br><p>‘Hah, the Silver Weaver is right. I actually forgot that all my power has always been in one move… Well, it’s time to do what I do best.’</p><br><br><p>The Silver Weaver’s needle crashed down on Adam, sending a wave of sand flying, but Adam was no longer there. He managed to dodge at the last moment.</p><br><p>“I see…” The Silver Weaver said slowly, looking at Adam, who was holding his needle tightly with both hands. “So that’s your answer?”</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply as energy coursed through his body, returning to the needle. He was going to use his strongest attack.</p><br><p>“My path is what will help me defeat you. One attack and it will all be over!”</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Adam put all his remaining strength into one move on the path quickly created. With his next step, Adam was supposed to disappear and reappear behind the Silver Weaver.</p><br><p>However, the Silver Weaver had an answer for that.</p><br><p>“As you wish, Adam.”</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver’s low voice rang out as he leaned forward, and his pure, snow-white energy rushed forward in a single stream.</p><br><p>“Let’s find out whose path is stronger. Whose desire is more important in this battle? Yours or mine?”</p><br><p>No one expected the Silver Weaver also to be able to use the path, but Adam was not going to back down.</p><br><p>He just smiled bitterly and took a step forward at the same time as the Silver Weaver.</p><br><p>At the same moment, two warriors, one monster, and the Phantom collided in the middle of two paths as a bright flash covered everything under the dark dome like an ancient sun.</p><br><p>Now, only one factor influenced the victory — which of the two would last longer, and whether Adam would have enough desire to continue no matter what.</p>
