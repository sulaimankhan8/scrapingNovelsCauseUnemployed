            <h4>Chapter 1040: Invitation on fight (Part 1)</h4><br><p>As they approached the scarlet lake, there were more and more roots as well as monsters. The Blood Hunters and the Blood Reapers were everywhere. They were the weakest and most numerous monsters of the blood pond.
</p><br><p>For Heret and Vorx, this would be a big problem. Even in the time of the king and queen, before Arnoth’s invasion, they had never traveled this far. It was too risky and it wasn’t necessary.
</p><br><p>Even if the serpents were gathering a large troop, the best thing to do was to kill the monsters, take the newly available essence, and return to the castle.
</p><br><p>But, right now, they had nothing to fear.
</p><br><p>The Blood Hunters and the Blood Reapers watched the four invaders from afar. Adam and Risha’s dark aura frightened them. However, Heret and Vorx weren’t weak either, but after defeating Arnoth and Kreyna, their auras were very different, being at different levels.
</p><br><br><p>Adam scratched his chin thoughtfully.
</p><br><p>"Do you think there will be four more essences in the lake?"
</p><br><p>Heret smiled awkwardly. "I’m sorry, but I can’t answer that since I don’t know. We’ve never tried to take over the lake. Unfortunately, it’s not a level even the strongest of serpents can afford."
</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam nodded deeply as he glanced briefly at the distant silhouette. It was unknown if it had noticed Adam.
</p><br><p>The silhouette took its time approaching the lake and didn’t look in Adam’s direction, but Adam could clearly feel its aura.
</p><br><p>’It’s definitely not a Hollow Wave monster, but... it looks strong, could this be one of the exceptions Arnoth was talking about?’
</p><br><p>Their stride continued at a calm pace.
</p><br><p>It seemed that in another minute, they would just reach the lake and take the blood essences lurking at the bottom, but among the regenerative monsters, some couldn’t let that happen.
</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.
</p><br><p>Two massive silhouettes appeared from the sides, the Voracious Beasts like regular dogs running among their legs.
</p><br><p>Adam looked up, grinning at the two new regenerative monsters on his list.
</p><br><p>They were different from all the previous ones, not only in their impressive stature comparable to the Light Goliaths but also in the way their bodies were built.
</p><br><p>Before the first layer of relatively soft muscle, woven like patches, were dark plates. It was still muscle, but very solid, like armor. They were located all over the body, arms, legs, and chest, but not on the abdomen.
</p><br><p>In the middle of the stomachs of the two Blood Crushers, there was a line of sharp teeth - a closed jaw, waiting for the right moment to devour its victim.
</p><br><p>The cascades of sharp spikes streamed down their long arms, keeping only their heads intact. Dark helmets covered all but two red eyes, as a bright glow occasionally emerged from their foreheads.
</p><br><p>"I see, so their core is at the heart?"
</p><br><br><p>The Blood Crushers stepped forward, standing shoulder to shoulder like two guards. They didn’t attack first, but they showed with their entire appearance that they wouldn’t let anyone else pass. The blood essences belonged to them by right.
</p><br><p>Vorx gulped. He was facing the Blood Crushers for the first time.
</p><br><br><p>"Well... There are four of us, so..." Heret muttered, about to suggest a plan of action.
</p><br><br><p>But Adam’s curt reply stumped him.
</p><br><p>"What? What are you talking about?" Heret was baffled.
</p><br><p>Then, Adam turned to Risha.
</p><br><p>"Hey, you can beat one of those, right? I haven’t seen your new ability, but I’m sure it’s something cool."
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Risha’s eyes lit up with sparks. It seemed like she had been waiting for a question like that for far too long.
</p><br><p>"Hah, of course I am! It won’t be a problem for me at all!"
</p><br><p>"Good, in that case of one... hmmm..." Adam raised an eyebrow. "Blood Crusher? I think that name will do. So, one will be taken on by Risha, and you deal with the other."
</p><br><p>Besides Risha, full of anticipation of a great battle, there were also Heret and Vorx, completely stumped.
</p><br><p>"Adam, I don’t think this is a good idea. We came here because of your idea, so you have to help us!" Heret waved his hand, a slight frown covering his face.
</p><br><p>Adam smiled slyly as his gaze traveled forward.
</p><br><p>"Oh, don’t worry, I’m sure you’ll be fine. What about me? Of course, I won’t just stand by and watch from the sidelines. I’m going to take care of something more dangerous!"
</p><br><p>Before Heret could answer anything, a four-pointed star shone brightly in Adam’s right eye as white energy enveloped his legs.
</p><br><p>In a single spurt, Adam left a hollow behind him.
</p><br><p>The white pulse swept between two of the Blood Crushers. The massive monsters were unable to react in time, and the Voracious Beasts that charged at Adam were reduced to bloody shards on contact with his energy.
</p><br><p>Moving at high speed, Adam swept across the lake, the water spreading out in waves from his surge.
</p><br><p>Even though the blood essences were directly below him, Adam had no intention of sinking to the bottom.
</p><br><p>Instead, he found himself on the other side of the lake, not far from the great tree itself. The ground was almost completely covered with twisted roots, illuminated by the faint red light from the crystals.
</p><br><p>Among all the monsters at the blood pond, only one made him wary. It wasn’t the intimidating Blood Crushers, but a small silhouette standing a few meters ahead.
</p><br><p>The crimson cloak covered a frail body, the mysterious creature was slightly smaller than Adam, like a lost maiden.
</p><br><p>"You... You are the one, aren’t you?" Adam smirked. "Come on. I can feel it. Show yourself and let’s fight!"
</p><br><p>Oddly enough, the monster answered nothing. On the contrary, it turned around getting ready to leave, leaving Adam with a confused expression.
</p><br><p>At the same moment, the spark coming out of the keyhole sprang into motion. It flew out of Adam’s chest, creating a white thread between him and the monster.
</p><br><p>Now, it all depended on whether the maiden was willing to take that risk.</p>
