            <br><p>Adam had many guesses as to what Tron's Nexus might be like.</p><br><p>And, after a brief moment of surprise, Adam realized that Tron's Nexus was more than suitable. There was nothing closer to glass than a mirror, which was an actual type of glass, but with different properties.</p><br><p>Now he had a chance to see it in action, against K4-Phantom's attack. Sure, Dahla made her attack of matching power, but it was still the energy of the K4-Phantom.</p><br><br><p>The golden orb collided with Tron's Nexus, but the mirror didn't block the orb or reflect it. The orb simply plunged into the black mirror, disappearing like in a murky lake of dark water hiding frightening secrets beneath.</p><br><p>Tron's muscles tensed as all the veins in his left arm swelled and for a moment glowed brightly with an amber light as if before a bomb went off.</p><br><p>Then, Tron's amethyst eyes went wide and from his mouth spurted streams of blood, reflecting his pain.</p><br><p>But, this could not throw Tron off target, over his path, like any strong Phantom, he faced many times situations where his enemy's attacks exceeded what he could withstand without injury.</p><br><br><p>Tron let out a low, deep wheeze releasing a cold vapor.</p><br><p>His wrist turned, pointing the Nexus to the side, then a glint of light flickered across the black mirror, stopping in the center.</p><br><br><p>A black sphere covered in purple flames flew out of the mirror, heading towards the ceiling at great speed.</p><br><p>As soon as the sphere collided with the amber resin, the upper half of the training hall was engulfed in flames, while the entire building shook violently as if it was ready to fall apart.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Pieces of amber fell from the ceiling as debris crashed to the floor in shards. Debris fell next to Tron, who collapsed to his knees with an exhausted look.</p><br><br><p>A new stream of blood gushed from Tron's mouth, thick and dark as if from a death river. Crimson trickles flowed from his eyes, ears, and nose.</p><br><p>In this short period, his body reached an extreme point, if it wasn't for Tron's experience and mastery, his body couldn't withstand it.</p><br><p>"No... What have I done..." Dahla uttered in a trembling voice as her eyes filled with fear.</p><br><br><p>As a new stream of blood gushed from Tron's mouth, Dahla realized that there was no more delay.</p><br><p>'Fuck! I have to do something!'</p><br><p>With panic in her eyes, Dahla ran forward, in a few quick leaps appearing in front of Tron.</p><br><br><p>An amber sphere of hexagons formed around them, releasing a bright golden light in an attempt to heal Tron's wounds as quickly as possible.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry... I didn't mean to... I don't know how I could make such a mistake..." Dahla said guiltily, quickly running her hands over Tron's left arm, wanting to fix the situation as soon as possible.</p><br><p>Dahla continued to apologize endlessly and her eyes grew wet, tears ready to rush out at any moment. She was ashamed and hurt that she wounded Tron, though she just needed to control her power.</p><br><p>Tron took a deep breath when he felt a little better and abruptly grabbed Dahla's chin, forcing her tear-reddened eyes to look into his amethyst ones.</p><br><p>"Hah... I didn't believe it before, but as always Riska was right..." Tron muttered with a bitter smile on his face.</p><br><p>Dahla got a baffled look on her face.</p><br><p>"Ah? What are you talking about? Especially at a moment like this..."</p><br><p>Tron let out a wheeze before he coughed.</p><br><p>"Moment...? I think it's a pretty good moment. You know... I like strong and confident women, but I have a real weakness for those who know how to care. So... If you asked me out a long time ago, I wouldn't refuse."</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Dahla's eyes went wide as she blinked a few times. She couldn't believe what she was hearing, it all seemed too strange to her.</p><br><p>Tron shrugged his shoulders.</p><br><p>"Sure, I could do it myself, but I realize just now that all this time Riska wasn't kidding about you liking me. I'm a grown man, so that's the maximum amount of sentimentality I'm willing to show."</p><br><p>Then, Tron lifted her chin slightly, moving closer to Dahla's face, their foreheads practically colliding, the tips of his gray hair swaying slightly from side to side.</p><br><p>"So I'm waiting for an answer, right now." Tron said seriously, oblivious to his wounds.</p><br><p>At this time, Silvana who had heard everything carefully, was moving her head from side to side, looking at Tron and Dahla then at Riska.</p><br><p>"Wait, wait, wait! You're not going to say anything? Is that okay with you?" Silvana exclaimed with a shocked stare looking at Riska.</p><br><p>Riska at this time was the epitome of serenity. She rested her cheek on her hand, watching the events with a slight, kind smile.</p><br><p>"Hm? What do you mean? I told Tron a long time ago that Dahla can't take her eyes off him, she's always looked at him as forbidden fruit, as something unreachable and untouchable, for a multitude of reasons most of which she made up herself." Riska nonchalantly replied.</p><br><p>Before Silvana could say anything, Riska continued: "I don't consider Tron my property just as he doesn't consider me his. We are adults who believe in each other's trust and loyalty more than anything else. Moreover, isn't that interesting?"</p><br><p>Then, Riska's kind expression disappeared for a moment replaced by a sharp look, a sly smile, and a predatory gesture as she licked her lips.</p><br><p>Silvana flinched, then she felt uneasy.</p><br><p>Seconds later, the kind smile returned to Riska's face.</p><br><p>"Sorry, I got a little carried away. Anyway, every Phantom-Operator pair has their specifics, right? And... If I'm being honest, I was slowly pushing this moment forward little by little."</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, she couldn't understand Riska, but at the same time, envy awakened inside her.</p><br><p>'I'm not sure I'll ever agree with everything Riska said, but their trust and understanding of each other is really something I wish Adam and I had...'</p><br><p>Adam was surprised too, but not that he had much time or desire to discuss it.</p><br><br><p>Adam fell to the ground without strength, he saw what Tron's Nexus was capable of, so it was time to rest after a hard fight.</p><br><p>Tron and Dahla turned around hearing a rumble, from Adam's fall.</p><br><p>"Looks like he needs your help too." Tron sighed, "So, I'm still waiting for your answer."</p><br><p>"Hah." Dahla smirked as she abruptly stood up looking at Tron from top to bottom with an arrogant smirk.</p><br><p>"I agree, but not because you invited me, I wanted to do it myself! You just beat me to it that's all!" Dahla said crossing her arms across her chest.</p><br><p>Tron shook his head with a bitter smile. His wounds were healing quickly thanks to the golden light from Dahla's ability.</p><br><p>"Good answer, but don't you dare act like that on a date, we're going to go to a calm, quiet place with high cuisine like grown-up, serious people, no childishness."</p><br><p>Tron narrowed his eyes as his voice became harsher: "Do you understand me?"</p><br><p>Goosebumps went down Dahla's body as she blushed and turned away sharply, modestly covering her mouth with her palm.</p><br><p>"Sure... as you wish..."</p>
