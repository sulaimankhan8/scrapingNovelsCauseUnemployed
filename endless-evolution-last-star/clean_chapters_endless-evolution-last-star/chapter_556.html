            <br><p>"You want to know who you're going to fight?" Nirosh said angrily, burning Adam with his gaze.</p><br><br><p>Nirosh lunged forward, grabbing Adam by the collar. He was ready to explode with rage, his dream was ruined because Adam agreed to help Osana.</p><br><p>"Right, nothing can be changed now, you've already used The Rule of Power, but... I promise you, when it's over, your life will be hell!"</p><br><br><p>Zarot squeezed Nirosh's wrist and tossed his son aside.</p><br><p>"F-Father?" Nirosh muttered in confusion. He thought Zarot would back him up, or at least not interfere, but he certainly didn't expect Zarot to protect Adam.</p><br><p>Zarot waved his hand.</p><br><p>"It is already too late. Your fate, and Osana's, will be decided on The Rule of Power."</p><br><p>Zarot said menacingly, before, turning to Adam.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter, leave, you have no reason to be here now. Next time I will see you on the battlefield. Me as a spectator and you as one of the two fighters."</p><br><p>However... Adam didn't budge.</p><br><p>He only slowly turned and looked at Osana, then raised his right hand showing his engagement ring.</p><br><p>"Unlike your son, I have this. I received this ring personally from Osana, so I have the right to speak to her whenever I want as her chosen one."</p><br><p>Mariel and Zarot looked at each other. Adam had acted brazenly, but they realized that Adam was right.</p><br><p>The wedding was on hold, Nirosh and Osana were technically strangers to each other, and everyone here was an adult and could decide for themselves who to talk to and who not to.</p><br><br><p>Osana stepped forward confidently before stopping next to Adam and bending over.</p><br><p>With a sharp movement of her hand, Osana began to tear her luxurious dress that cost like a fortune of some middle-aged businessman.</p><br><p>Mariel's mouth opened wide, she gasped in shock and horror.</p><br><br><p>In a few more movements, Osana almost completely got rid of her dress, leaving only a bit of fabric to cover the top of her thighs.</p><br><p>The white shreds were lying on the ground, hardly recoverable now to be turned back into a gorgeous dress for a high noble.</p><br><p>Osana narrowed her eyes, looking at Nirosh with disdain.</p><br><p>"You can have this dress for yourself, I certainly won't be using it anymore since Adam isn't going to lose." Osana snorted, arrogantly moving on.</p><br><p>Adam cast one last glance at Nirosh, Zarot, and Mariel, then followed Osana.</p><br><p>Osana could stop in the banquet hall, but she went on - settling only in the garden, amidst the nightlights.</p><br><p>"Is everything okay?" Adam asked in a calm voice.</p><br><p>Taking a deep breath, Osana nodded and smirked slyly.</p><br><p>"Yes, it went even better than I expected. However, I didn't see Baren coming, and the fact that Franz is bringing that male waiter, his power is actually frightening."</p><br><p>Adam stared at Osana for a while before directing his gaze higher, the blue moon gradually rising, eager to take its place in the center of the night sky.</p><br><p>They didn't say anything. Osana needed time to recover, for though everything went well, she was quite nervous. There were many moments where things could go wrong, but in the end, Adam used The Rule of Power as they had originally planned.</p><br><br><p>A rustle of leaves sounded as someone's shadow appeared behind them.</p><br><p>Adam and Osana turned around, meeting eyes with Gladius. He had a sly smile on his face as always, holding a tray with two glasses of champagne like a regular waiter.</p><br><p>"Bride and groom, probably real this time. Would you like to have a drink and hit the road?" Gladius said in a sweet voice.</p><br><p>Read latest stories on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Simultaneously, they raised their eyebrows in confusion.</p><br><p>"Hit the road? Where?" Adam tilted his head.</p><br><p>Gladius smirked, his eyes narrowing as he waved his hand toward the east.</p><br><p>"To where the Moon Colosseum is, in the ninth wing! And... to whoever helped me set up your fight in this arena."</p><br><p>Adam blinked a few times before realization came to him.</p><br><p>"Right, the fight is about five hours away. The Sun Colosseum is in the first wing and the Moon Colosseum is in the ninth wing."</p><br><p>Then, Adam turned to Osana, who was much better versed in the subject than he was.</p><br><p>"I already know about the four great families, but what about the ninth wing? Which family is in charge there?"</p><br><p>Osana knew the answer to that question and could respond instantly, but it took her a while as if she was remembering everything she knew about that family.</p><br><p>"Agh, ninth wing... It's the worst place in the entire first ring, it's like a part of hell appearing right in heaven and everyone would be fine with it."</p><br><p>Adam was baffled. He knew there was a difference between the wings, but it was more to do with ordinary citizens, not nobles, much less a family from the Twelve Branches.</p><br><p>Osana sighed heavily, shaking her head.</p><br><p>"Well, you'll see for yourself soon enough." Osana stared at Gladius, "I take it one of the Noukx Family is already waiting for us, right?"</p><br><br><p>"Sure. We'll meet with the Head of the Noukx Family."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"What... the family head? Honestly, after recent events, I was expecting us to meet the eldest child of the Noukx Family or something like that." Adam assumed.</p><br><p>Osana looked away as she bit her lip.</p><br><p>"Well, if it were any other family it would be like that. But, the Noukx Family is special, more specifically their current generation."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam gave her a questioning look. He didn't understand how anyone could be special even among the Twelve Branches, especially if it was a family from the ninth wing.</p><br><p>Osana glared at Adam as if she was about to tell him something frightening and evil.</p><br><p>"Kogen Noukx is the only member of the main branch of his family. There doesn't seem to be anything strange about that, but... Kogen Noukx is the youngest Head among all Twelve Branches."</p><br><p>Osana's gaze grew darker.</p><br><p>"And... his story is not like the other heads at all, it is bloody and violent, just like the Noukx Family and the ninth wing."</p>
