            <br><p>Long, voluminous jets of steam came out of two dark nostrils, not from a human but from a sleeping monster.</p><br><p>Obsidian Hydra was several dozen times the size of Obsidian Spiders, the Elite Obsidian Spider, which was much larger than its younger relatives, was comparable to Obsidian Hydra's head, or rather one of its heads.</p><br><p>The Obsidian Hydra had three large heads, with elongated jaws and long fangs protruding slightly under the thick hide.</p><br><p>Its entire body was covered in dense protective scales that reflected light from nearby crystals, however, its belly and the inside of its long necks were stripped of such protection, replaced by a thick beige skin composed of membranous fabric wrapped in several layers.</p><br><p>The Obsidian Hydra was stripped of both horns and tail, however its body had excellent balance thanks to its massive, heavy torso and four strong paws with short but sharp claws.</p><br><p>However, unlike lizards and spiders, it was obvious to Silvana and the others that Obsidian Hydra's primary weapon was not its physical strength or defense.</p><br><p>From time to time, a light energy vibration passed through Obsidian Hydra's body, emanating from the monster's chest.</p><br><p>Below its three necks, on the front of its torso were twelve massive crystals like those of Elite spiders or lizards, but that was just the outside for the giant-sized round crystal filled with pure energy.</p><br><p>"How much time do we have?" Silvana asked realizing what Obsidian Hydra was doing.</p><br><p>'Enough. If you look closely you will see that Obsidian Hydra is not lying on the ground but on a pile of energy crystals.'</p><br><p>Silvana lowered her gaze as Adam said.</p><br><br><p>From beneath Obsidian Hydra's heavy body peeked a layer of gray debris, long depleted crystals.</p><br><p>"Damn, there's enough of them in there for a thousand Obsidian Spiders." Abel was shocked.</p><br><p>Talna shook her head.</p><br><p>"Of course, because Obsidian Hydra is much bigger than spiders and lizards. Obviously, it's going to need a lot of power."</p><br><p>Adam continued in a calm voice:</p><br><p>'First of all, I wouldn't advise you to make any noise before you attack, especially you Talna.'</p><br><p>Talna rolled her eyes unhappily but didn't say anything.</p><br><p>'Secondly, based on what I see and the information I have, evolution will end in one or two days. So I suggest you take your time during the battle.</p><br><p>"Good, that's what I wanted to hear. It's a good thing we went on the mission today otherwise it could be too late later."</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply before glancing at Talna.</p><br><p>"Blood halos over our heads... Was that the only ability of your Nexus?"</p><br><p>Talna's corners of her mouth went up, forming a sly smirk.</p><br><p>"Of course not, I have something else, as well as stored energy on orders. Don't worry, I'll do what's required of me, but... should I stay here or come down?"</p><br><p>Then, Silvana looked under her feet. Unlike the exit from the second level, here the descent was not straight, but at an incline - they could just slip down.</p><br><p>"Be here for now, if Obsidian Hydra injures you at the beginning of the fight, the situation could abruptly become much more difficult."</p><br><p>In response, Talna only nodded silently and raised her right hand up, the silver cross dangling from her wrist. She was ready to use her Nexus once more at any moment, but not now.</p><br><p>Any energy fluctuation would immediately awaken Obsidian Hydra, that much was clear even to a Phantom rookie.</p><br><p>At the same moment, their squad fell into silence, forgetting about talking, much less joking.</p><br><p>Silvana and Abel looked at each other and simultaneously stepped forward, approaching Obsidian Hydra quickly and silently.</p><br><p>Normally Abel would be ahead to protect his allies, but now they had the opportunity to make the first attack on a sleeping enemy, so the first action was up to Silvana.</p><br><p>In the few fights above, she already used two of her abilities, but not her Nexus. Most of the time she used her menacing scissors in the form of two blades, but only against large crowds of enemies and weak monsters.</p><br><p>When she had a strong enemy in front of her, she couldn't allow herself to trade strength for speed.</p><br><p>'Fine, you have three heads, right? In that case, it'll be good to reduce the weight on your dirty shoulders...'</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The massive scissors shuddered, dense black energy running along the blades at the sharp edges.</p><br><p>Then, Silvana stepped forward, holding her weapon firmly with both hands. She thrust the scissors forward and opened them wide at maximum amplitude, staring intently at the Obsidian Hydra's right neck.</p><br><p>She knew her limits, there was no way she could kill such a large monster in one attack. Explore more stories with My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>A bright light from the energy raging within filled her eyes, causing Obsidian Hydra to flinch at the unfamiliar ripples, but it was too late.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, in front of Obsidian Hydra's left head appeared a massive replica of Silvana's scissors of black as the depths of the abyss of energy, were wide open mimicking the movements of their owner.</p><br><br><br><p>Silvana abruptly closed her scissors, a loud snap echoed throughout the spacious cavern, quickly reaching the cold walls.</p><br><p>Immediately, a ghostly replica of her scissors repeated her movement.</p><br><p>Two broad black blades closed around Obsidian Hydra's neck, easily passing through the protective scales and thick hide that even the Elite Obsidian Spiders couldn't bite through with their powerful jaws.</p><br><p>A mad grin appeared on Talna's face, her bloodshot eyes watching with obvious pleasure as the huge neck, more than ten meters long, flew off to the side along with Obsidian Hydra's right head.</p><br><p>A wave of bright pain went through every cell of Obsidian Hydra's body, awakening it from its deep slumber.</p><br><p>"ROOOOOOOAAAAAAAAARRRR!!!!"</p><br><p>A painful howl roared from the two remaining heads while a fountain of dark blood erupted from the right head, or rather from what was left of its long neck, the cut was two meters above the Hydra's body level.</p><br><p>"Hehehehe, minus one, now there's only two left." Talna chuckled evilly, her voice sending shivers down Abel and Silvana's backs.</p><br><p>"However... We'll have to fight fair this time." Talna uttered looking at the Obsidian Hydra's rising above the ground.</p><br><p>The two heads glared viciously at the two Phantoms standing in front, no bigger than ants, but far more dangerous and deadly.</p>
