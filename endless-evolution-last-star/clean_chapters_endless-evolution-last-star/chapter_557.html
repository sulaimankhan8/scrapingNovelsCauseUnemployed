            <br><br><p>With a wave of his hand, as if by magic, Gladius changed from his waiter's uniform to a chauffeur's outfit.</p><br><p>A few minutes later, a wide black car moved out of the way - heading straight for the ninth wing.</p><br><p>Next to Gladius, Rosalind sat in the driver's seat. She kept her back straight and didn't feel very comfortable being so close to Gladius, but she had no other choice.</p><br><p>She clenched her fists tightly and stared ahead, hoping that Gladius drove better than he served the guests as a waiter, otherwise a disaster awaited them.</p><br><p>There were plenty of people sitting on the back wide seats facing each other with a built-in mini-bar like in a wedding limousine or a political car.</p><br><p>Franz and Nelya sat at the right window, Osana sat at the left window, and Baren was across from her.</p><br><p>On the other part, opposite Franz and Nelya sat Adam and Silvana, Adam was looking out of the window and Silvana was between him and Baren.</p><br><p>In this way, all six back and two front seats were occupied.</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Osana from time to time, waiting for her to continue her story which was interrupted by Franz, who suddenly approached them in the garden when they were discussing the ninth wing.</p><br><p>"So...? Will someone tell me what's special about the ninth wing and Kogen Noukx? You said he's the youngest head among all Twelve Branches." Adam began, looking at Osana.</p><br><p>Osana nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yes, as I said earlier, Kogen Noukx is the only member of the main branch of his family, at least until he has children, but that will be the next generation."</p><br><p>Then, Osana held out her hand, pointing first to herself and Baren, after that to Franz and Nelya.</p><br><p>"We are all members of the main branch, as our parent is the family head. However, the moment when one of us will become the next head if it ever happens at all, is still very far away."</p><br><br><p>Experience exclusive tales on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>He realized that not only the head's children from the main branch were fighting for the role of the family head, but also all the other offspring of the head's siblings from the side branches, all of them entitled to become the family head. Well, if they were Light Nobles.</p><br><p>"But, not too long ago, Kogen Noukx was in the same position as us. Moreover, he was the only son of the former head, meaning he was the only one in the main branch."</p><br><p>Osana said calmly, cast a glance at Baren, and continued:</p><br><p>"Strange as it may seem, especially considering that this is the ninth wing, the Noukx Family has never conducted a first-born selection. I mean, they don't send their first children into the Dead Lands, hoping that one of them can kill a monster and become a True Firstborn, like my brother did..."</p><br><p>Toward the end, Osana's voice became quieter, she needed to talk about it, but she didn't want to make it uncomfortable for Baren. However, he didn't react in any way, no emotion appeared on his face.</p><br><p>Unlike the others, he didn't consider his status as something special, from his point of view he was a Natural Phantom, that was all. And, Baren was not wrong.</p><br><p>"Thus, Kogen Noukx was an actual first child of the former head. Moreover, because of that, the previous head only had one wife, one woman. He didn't try to make many children since he didn't plan to make a selection of firstborns." Osana said calmly.</p><br><p>Adam nodded and briefly waved his hand a few times.</p><br><p>"Fine, I get about that, but I'm more interested in what happened next. What happened to the last head? How did Kogen become the new head of his family and the youngest among all the great families?"</p><br><p>Osana took a deep breath, her gaze growing darker.</p><br><p>"Agh, it all happened a few years ago. His uncle, Geradin Noukx, wanted to become the new head, and given that this is a ninth wing family, he chose the most straightforward way possible - murder."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment, then his gaze filled with a realization.</p><br><p>"That means he was stronger..."</p><br><p>Osana nodded, folding her hands on her lap.</p><br><p>"Sure, but if it happened in any other wing, he could just defeat the current head, killing was unnecessary. However, that's not the worst of it. Geradin also killed Kogen's mother, that is, the past head's wife."</p><br><p>Adam's pupils narrowed, as his fingertips trembled.</p><br><p>Not that this level of brutality was something Adam couldn't imagine, but to him, it was still something unimaginable.</p><br><p>Such atrocities and cruelty didn't occur in the Dead Lands or the slums but in the First Ring, a family of high nobles, one of the twelve most powerful and wealthy families in the entire Citadel!</p><br><p>"Of course, Geradin wanted to kill Kogen as well, to completely get rid of the bloodline of the former head, but Kogen successfully managed to escape. I don't know where he was hiding, but most likely either in one of the Bastions in the Dead Lands or the Lower Ring."</p><br><p>Adam gulped. With every story he heard about the nobles, their traditions, rules, and ancient laws, he realized more and more that for some of them, life wasn't easy at all.</p><br><p>'Damn... Even if you're a high noble, your life can still be filled with cruelty, injustice, and pain.' Adam pondered with a dark look.</p><br><br><p>"Everyone forgot about Kogen already, he was too weak to stand up against Geradin, but... after a few years, he came back. And... in that time he became insanely strong." Osana's voice trembled, it seemed that Kogen actually did something beyond her comprehension.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, yeah, this guy is incredible!" Gladius suddenly exclaimed with a sly laugh.</p><br><p>Osana waved her hand in front of her.</p><br><p>"In a bloody and brutal battle, Kogen killed his uncle and head of the Noukx Family at that time."</p><br><br><p>"Well, the story is brutal and sad, but it ended where it began, didn't it?"</p><br><p>Osana nodded uncertainly before looking intently at Adam.</p><br><p>"Yes, but this story is dark and bloody not because of this series of deaths but how their fight went and what Kogen did afterward."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam looked at her puzzled, he saw quite a few violent fights and was involved in them himself.</p><br><p>Osana shook her head and bit her lip almost to the point of bleeding before turning to Adam.</p><br><p>"Kogen Noukx, that fucking psycho, didn't put up a fight in the arena or Dead Lands but right in the middle of the ninth wing, because of a fight of that level several thousand people died, dozens of buildings and several skyscrapers turned into ruins, rivers of dark blood flowing under the rubble."</p><br><p>Despite what Osana said, it seemed that wasn't what she was nervous about.</p><br><p>"Kogen won with his last move - he ripped out Geradin's eye, and thrust his own severed arm into the resulting hole, thus piercing Geradin's brain with his sharp bone."</p><br><p>Osana gulped, her face darkening.</p><br><p>"Then, without taking the time to rest or to heal his wounds or deal with the aftermath of their fight..."</p><br><p>Osana clenched her fists, forcing herself to look at Adam.</p><br><p>"Right in the center of the destroyed ninth wing, Kogen burned the already dead Geradin and ate him, completely, every last bit of his flesh, under the gazes of the survivors and his family members - grinning widely with a demonic gleam in his eyes."</p>
