            <br><p>Chapter 1073: First Encounter (Part 2)<br>
Recently, at the Dark Shore, or rather right before its border, there was a battle between the Second Rank Phantom and the two Lords.</p><br><p>However, due to the large difference in strength between Gladius and the two guards, it couldn’t be called a real fight. Gladius just killed them as any K4-Phantom facing a Red Threat monster would.</p><br><p>Well, the guards were Lords, so Gladius used an ability on them that K-Phantoms couldn’t have. Only Phantoms at the same rank as Gladius could have this power.</p><br><p>This was one of the few differences between beings of two different evolutionary stages.</p><br><p>Gladius was not the only Phantom who possessed this ability. There were unique abilities among the Lords as well, each had something different, and much was influenced by their status as Lords.</p><br><p>But, among the Lords, there was something that the Phantoms received even at the very beginning of their journey. Strangely enough, this was true. Every K0-Phantom had something that even the Red Threat Monsters didn’t have, even though they were dozens of times stronger.</p><br><p>The Phantoms and the Monsters were different originally. Monsters were able to absorb energy from the environment, thus constantly accumulating resources and becoming stronger over time. Phantoms had no such feature, and their abilities had a much wider range than monsters.</p><br><p>For humans, evolution was also much more complicated because they were able to control energy either by force or due to their original talent. In one way or another, every Phantom received the Spark along the way. Some did it by killing a monster, and some were lucky enough to have a lot of dense energy in their bodies.</p><br><p>Phantoms could only use artifacts, monsters they killed, essences, and more as tools on their path. The monsters could absorb everything, getting closer to the evolutionary gate faster by constantly stepping over the barrier.</p><br><p>This was one of the reasons why there were more Lords than the Second Rank Phantoms.</p><br><p>It was much easier to accumulate resources, rely on their instincts, and absorb energy than it was for humans to go through one barrier after another.</p><br><p>Sure, it wasn’t easy for either monsters. Becoming a Lord, even if it was a Baron, was a great honor and a supreme achievement.</p><br><p>Yet, there were several trump cards on the human side. In addition to a variety of abilities and high technology, they had a weapon. Not guns or rifles like the military, but a weapon like the warriors – the Nexus.</p><br><p>It didn’t matter if it was a huge sword, an axe, gloves, a ring, or even a hairpin. The Phantom created his Nexus from his cells, energy, and blood, which then evolved with it.</p><br><p>Yes, monsters didn’t have the Nexus. They had claws, instincts, tough scales, tails, or wings. The list of different body parts was long, many could be used as weapons.</p><br><p>The poison, flame breath, webbing, powerful jaws, incredible physical strength, speed, and more, but was it like a sword in the hand?</p><br><p>Sure, for many monsters, the weapon would be useless. Why would a beast need an axe that it couldn’t even take in its paws if it had sharp claws?</p><br><p>But the Lords were different. Sure, not all of them, but those who took one of the two paths were much like humans in body constitution.</p><br><p>Like the weaker Crown Type monsters, the Lords could fight using a weapon, spear, or sword, not just their fangs and energy.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Kenex stood in the freezing stream of his aura and threw his hand forward, holding tightly to his forearm as his eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>Energy in a powerful stream rushed from his chest, running down his arm to take the form of a white lance with a sharp, icy tip. The lance held the hilt underneath the cone, allowing his hand to hide underneath the protective layer.</p><br><p>“Hahaha! I’ve waited too long for this!” Horon laughed as he pounded his chest with his fist.</p><br><p>With a red splash, energy came out of his chest in chaotic streams, transforming into a massive hammer in front of him. He gripped the hammer tightly with both hands as his hair caught fire, the tips rippling from side to side like the sun.</p><br><p>The last one was Serra.</p><br><p>She threw Saegar an arrogant look as her eyes shone brightly with pure light.</p><br><p>With a bright flash, behind her appeared two majestic wings of hundreds of sharp blades reflecting the light of the sun to shine vividly.</p><br><p>Kenward, who was already in the temple, pouring wine into his glass, cast a glance to the side.</p><br><p>‘Looks like they’ve made serious preparations. They’ve been waiting for this moment… Do they really want so badly to show that they are better than Saegar? That each of them can surpass him in the future?’</p><br><br><p>Kenward sat up when his scarf flinched slightly.</p><br><p>“Agh, though to most monsters they are almost gods, but they forget that gods are not few, and even among them, not all are equal. They want to climb to the top of the Befallen Crown, not knowing that there’s nothing at the top…”</p><br><p>After a few moments, he shook his head and took a sip.</p><br><p>“I was in their shoes once. All you get once you’re on top is the ability to stare at the void until you realize you have no more purpose.”</p><br><br><p>Serra flapped her wings, making the space shake. Kenex and Horon leaped to the sides, surrounding Saegar.</p><br><p>He stood in the center with a bored expression.</p><br><p>“What are you waiting for?!” Serra exclaimed in outrage. “Summon your Arc! If you accept the fight, then fight seriously! There will be no honor in this victory, no weight if we kill an arrogant Lord!”</p><br><br><p>Saegar said nothing letting the cold wind blow across his too young for his age face.</p><br><p>How old was he anyway?</p><br><br><p>“What?!” Serra grimaced.</p><br><p>Saegar slowly looked around at them.</p><br><p>“If you want to see my Arc, you’ll have to make me.”</p><br><br><p>As soon as his foot touched the air, he was in front of Serra, forcing her eyes to go wide.</p><br><p>“It’s in your best interest not to die too soon.”</p>
