            <br><p>"But... You made it through, didn't you? You managed to become a Natural Phantom." Mariel said, trying to encourage Fromund.</p><br><p>She realized how dangerous it was for a 15-year-old boy, defeating a monster being a normal human was too difficult, the death rate was excessively high.</p><br><p>Well... some people just didn't have any other choice.</p><br><p>''Yeah, otherwise I wouldn't be here. It's worth recognizing that the man they took me to helped me in any way he could."</p><br><p>Fromund shrugged with a bitter smile.</p><br><p>"He taught me how to fight at a basic level, though... in the Lower Ring, anyone in my situation would know how to do that if they wanted to survive. Gave me a weapon, and also told me how to kill the first monster."</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, he continued:</p><br><p>"Sure, all of that only slightly increased my chances, but it was at least something. I managed to kill the monster, but... then I lost an arm and a leg, killing the monster in the last seconds of my life."</p><br><p>Then, Fromund patted himself on his left shoulder and right knee.</p><br><p>"I guess I don't need to tell you how I recovered. You higher nobles surely know about it."</p><br><p>Mariel, Zarot, and Nirosh just nodded, they understood what Fromund was talking about, healing wounds like his was more than possible. Well, it was unknown if the monster ate his arm and leg or just ripped it off since that was important for treatment, but there were ways to fix things for any situation.</p><br><p>"Do you know what that man's name was?" Zarot asked with a serious expression, it seemed he had some suspicions, it mattered to him.</p><br><p>In response, Fromund only shook his head.</p><br><p>"Nah, he was quite brief and harsh, spoke only to the point and more I did not ask for. Every word he said had either a benefit or some meaning, for my situation that was the most crucial thing."</p><br><p>Then, Fromund pointed his body forward, bending slightly, a nostalgic smile on his face.</p><br><p>"I just remember his deep emerald eyes, darkness covering most of his silhouette, his high collar, and the smoke from his cigarettes, he smoked them one after the other, in no hurry to get anywhere."</p><br><p>Mariel and Zarot glanced over, their eyes going wide for a moment as if that description might indicate some people, given the details of Fromund's history.</p><br><p>"I take it after you became a Natural Phantom the story has no more interesting parts, right?" Mariel asked.</p><br><p>Fromund nodded deeply as he spread his hands.</p><br><p>"That's right. I knew that if I wanted a better life for myself and Elva, Liv, and Tilda, then we needed to get into the Upper Ring. I mean, if your situation is normal and not like ours, you can live in the Lower Ring and be pretty successful, but not when you're a teenager with three little sisters to look after and raise up."</p><br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda, who were eavesdropping on the conversation smiled slightly. They realized that if their brother was alone, he would have no trouble finding a good place in the Lower Ring, especially after he became a Phantom.</p><br><p>However, for their sake, a suitable place to raise them was necessary.</p><br><p>The Lower Ring had many pros and cons, but it was definitely not a quiet place. Your adventure continues at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"With the first money from my first missions as a Phantom, I immediately moved into the Upper Ring, here in the Third Ring. And, after that, almost all of my money earned from missions goes to pay off debt."</p><br><p>Then, Fromund's eyes grew darker.</p><br><p>"I think you realize that I have no other option. If I don't pay, then... no, they won't kill me, they'll take Elva, Liv, and Tilda, and..."</p><br><p>Fromund couldn't finish. But, from his deep, trembling gaze, it was clear. This was the worst nightmare for him, as his little sisters, were his entire family and the only hope for a normal life that he never had.</p><br><p>Even though he was supposed to earn money constantly to pay back the debt to the people from Lower Ring, causing them to save quite a bit, now was the best time of his life.</p><br><p>'Hah... Although there are still many problems to deal with ahead, but... the important thing is that life is slowly improving, at least a little bit at a time.' Fromund thought as a bitter smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"Khm." Mariel coughed, drawing attention to herself, "Before starting this story you said it was a story about the worst father and mother, especially mother... I understand why you hate her, but wasn't it all because of your last father? He was the one who decided to betray those people..."</p><br><p>Fromund threw a sharp look at Mariel, showing that he was not in agreement with her.</p><br><p>"Female solidarity? Or are you as a mother trying to defend another mother's honor? Well, you won't succeed since I'm good at making cause-and-effect connections, I have more than a 10 IQ, you know?"</p><br><p>His cold words, made Mariel flinch.</p><br><p>"Sure, our last father made a serious mistake, but it was all because of our mother. It's not even that she brought him into our family, it's that she spent days and nights begging and terrorizing him into agreeing to this deal, all so that she could buy another dose."</p><br><p>Fromund clenched his fists tightly.</p><br><p>"She caused everything, and I'm not sure I'm even grateful to her for giving me and my sisters a life. It's a miracle we ended up here, where we've been living a quiet life for the past few years, there was a good chance we wouldn't be alive by now."</p><br><p>Mariel, Zarot, and Nirosh said nothing. They realized that Fromund was right.</p><br><p>The mere fact that he became a Natural Phantom was a great fortune, not to mention the many other little things that allowed them to leave the Lower Ring.</p><br><p>"Agh... Well, now you know my story and we have less than ten minutes left to announce the second fighter. Let's start negotiating your bounty."</p><br><p>Then, without delay, Fromund confidently raised his chin and said in a low voice: "I want 200 million for the fight."</p>
