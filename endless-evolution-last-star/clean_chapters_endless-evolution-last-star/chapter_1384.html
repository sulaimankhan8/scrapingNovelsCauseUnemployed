            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1384: New path for the host</strong></p><br><p>Mona had been a loyal servant of the White Spire for a long time, but he had tragically died many years ago.</p><br><p>Now, even Adam had partially witnessed what had happened — an ancient monster had attacked the island, and it was only thanks to a miracle and a mysterious man that Bertrada had survived. At the same time, only a small part of the White Spire’s energy remained.</p><br><p>She continued to be a servant of Bertrada, the Silver Beacon, and for the most part, she did the same work as before. After all, Bertrada’s real body was at the Forgotten Mills, and she only conducted the trials on the territory of the White Spire.</p><br><p>Now, a unique, one-of-a-kind opportunity to become independent had opened up for Mona.</p><br><p>For her, this decision was more difficult than for most, as she had been in the position of a servant for several hundred years. She was used to living this way, she liked living this way, and this was her life.</p><br><p>However, even for her, the desire to feel freedom and work with the White Spire again, even if it was only a part of his energy, was too strong to refuse.</p><br><br><p>Mona stepped forward and grabbed the fragment tightly.</p><br><p>For a moment, the world froze as Bertrada stared at her with wide eyes. She couldn’t believe that Mona had actually accepted the offer and that now she would be here alone.</p><br><p>“No… Mona, you can’t leave!” Bertrada exclaimed, on the verge of tears.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The space trembled as a dark door appeared behind Mona. An identical door opened next to the ruins at the edge of the island. The dark orb awaited Mona as its honored guest.</p><br><p>However, Mona was in no hurry to leave. Instead of running away from the glass sphere as a captive would, she calmly stepped forward.</p><br><p>Mona and Bertrada exchanged glances as she knelt on one knee, pressing her palm to her chest.</p><br><p>“Mistress, no… Bertrada. I want you to know that I don’t regret the time I spent here. I’m not leaving the island. I’ll stay here, but I’ll follow my own path, just as I’ll visit the gray tower from time to time and help with the trials of future contenders if you so desire.”</p><br><br><p>No one said anything for a while, until Bertrada bit her lip until it bled.</p><br><p>“Tsk. Get up. You are no longer my servant, you don’t have to kneel. I hope you get what you’re looking for… Working with the White Spire, right… That’s really what you want.” Bertrada clenched her fists tightly, struggling to contain her emotions.</p><br><p>Mona smiled slightly and nodded deeply. She stood up and looked at Adam, who was silently awaiting her decision.</p><br><p>“Thank you… I didn’t think you could actually change anything. If I have the opportunity, I will do everything in my power to help you.”</p><br><p>Adam shrugged with a smirk. “Well, what can I say? Someone had to do it. In fact, you should thank the Part of White Spire, it was its suggestion. I just did my job.”</p><br><p>“In any case, I am immensely grateful to you.”</p><br><p>Thus, Mona bowed once more and headed forward, disappearing into a dark door after a few steps.</p><br><p>For a long time, Bertrada said nothing. She just stood in one place and stared into the void, seemingly not even breathing.</p><br><p>Adam, in turn, went to the table and brewed some tea, soon filling both his and Bertrada’s cups.</p><br><p>“Agh.” With a slight sigh, he crossed one leg over the other and took a sip of hot tea. “Come on, it didn’t turn out as bad as it could have, right?”</p><br><p>Bertrada frowned, but sat down opposite him and brought the cup to her lips.</p><br><br><br><p>“Tsk, you brewed the tea disgustingly. How can anyone drink this?”</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand. “Stop complaining. It was bound to happen sooner or later, or did you think Mona would always be your right-hand woman?”</p><br><p>“Pfffft! Maybe that’s exactly what I wanted, so what?”</p><br><p>“You’re lying, though…” Adam closed his eyes. “You’re just not being completely honest with yourself.”</p><br><p>Bertrada took a few more sips, tapping her fingers nervously on the table.</p><br><p>“Just… After the White Spire fell, she was the only one I knew. You wouldn’t understand, but it’s complicated for an artifact to establish contact with someone. Even if you have a good relationship with a Phantom or a monster, sooner or later, they have to leave for another region.”</p><br><p>“Well, there’s nothing wrong with that. I’m talking about your desire to stay close to her.”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Bertrada raised an eyebrow, confused.</p><br><p>“I’m sure it’s a big blow to you, just like it was to Mona, but like she said, she didn’t leave the island. Just look.” He pointed to the side.</p><br><p>Bertrada’s eyes widened as she watched Mona communicate with the dark orb. Her eyes burned brightly, and she was full of enthusiasm to work in a new direction.</p><br><p>“ARGH!” Bertrada grabbed her hair in frustration and regret. “No matter what you say, I still can’t stand to watch this! I want her to stay with me and… we’ll continue the trials.”</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly. “You’ll have that opportunity. Didn’t you hear her?”</p><br><p>Then, Adam placed an empty cup on the table and adjusted his collar.</p><br><p>“Alright, I’m ready. Take me back.”</p><br><p>With a displeased look, Bertrada nodded.</p><br><p>A few minutes later, using her energy and threads, she created a shimmering portal that would send Adam straight to the Silver Beacon at the Forgotten Mills. All he had to do was take one step.</p><br><p>“Before you go, I have one question for you.” The Silver Beacon looked at Adam. “You think I’m a piece of shit, right?”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>“Maybe towards me, but not towards Mona. After all, you let her go even though you don’t want her to leave. You did it because you understand that it’s better for her. That’s pretty good.”</p><br><p>In response, Bertrada smirked.</p><br><p>“Tsk. Thanks, now, get lost.”</p><br><p>Adam glanced at the portal.</p><br><p>“Sure. It’s time to move on.”</p>
