            <br><p>This time the active trembling was felt by everyone, Phantom and monster alike, there were no exceptions. It was unlike anything that happened before as if waiting for a powerful earthquake ready to change the landscape forever.</p><br><p>Before the Phantoms and monsters could jump to any conclusions, a stream of blood gushed out of the ground near the eastern wall.</p><br><p>It was small, the top point didn't even reach the middle of the fortress, something like this couldn't bring destruction or change the course of the battle, but this was just the beginning.</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Every second, at random points around the fortress, scarlet streams of water poured out, and in less than a minute the first bloody pillar appeared, massive and tall, towering over the walls.</p><br><p>Viron, watching the progression of events shook his head, his gaze filled with gloom.</p><br><p>"Hah... Here come the consequences of the actions of the Unknown Phantom. It seems it won't be long before we meet both him and the threat he brought. If he's still alive, of course."</p><br><p>Katrin's eyes went wide, she was confused, no one was prepared for the torrents of blood gushing from the ground like geysers. Moreover, no one knew why it was happening or what consequences awaited them.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>When there were several dozen scarlet streams and several bloody pillars on each side of the fortress, along the hills, the last most powerful tremble went through the fortress.</p><br><p>There were cracks along the shattered sections of the walls, stones fell one after another, and the towers swayed from side to side.</p><br><p>It seemed that a little more and the fortress would fall in a powerful earthquake, and at the end of the shiver, there would be only ruins and debris.</p><br><p>But, soon there was silence. The shaking stopped abruptly, giving the Phantoms panic and confusion. No one understood what was happening.</p><br><p>Should they have fled the fortress? Would the walls be able to withstand another earthquake like this? Would it ever happen again?</p><br><p>To the north, a layer of black sand stretched up, causing the lying snow to roll down the edge of the resulting hill.</p><br><p>Then, a few drops of blood, dark and saturated with power, showed out.</p><br><p>Whoooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>The sharp red blade rushed upward, leading the largest blood torrent of all, consuming most of the bloody river.</p><br><p>The blade moved towards the clouds without stopping, wanting to reach the heavens. The trembling pillar of blood followed the blade, gradually taking on a different, more stable shape.</p><br><p>The blood slowed down, turning into a solid dark red material with a twisted shape, coiling around a tall rod, the base of the flow like a serpent.</p><br><p>Phantoms and monsters raised their heads upwards, looking at the new structure appearing out of nowhere in less than a minute.</p><br><p>The serpent spire was much taller than the ice towers and towers of the fortress, it was on par with the height of the spire, the blade could not advance any farther towards the sky.</p><br><p>The bloody serpent coiled around the spire was a soulless statue, a piece of stone infused with energy and blood, yet it emitted a powerful aura unmatched by any monster or Phantom.</p><br><p>It was something new, something no other monster types were capable of, wanting to take over the fortress during the eclipse.</p><br><p>At the very top of the serpent spire floated a crimson crystal, electrical discharges occasionally passing across its surface, sending its power toward the clouds.</p><br><br><p>She didn't need to ask Alan or any of the Phantoms, she realized that no one knew anything about it, and neither did she.</p><br><p>Gnash took a few steps back. She could feel how much energy was in every stream, in every pillar of blood, and especially in the serpent spire.</p><br><p>If one monster had created all of this, they didn't stand a chance against it.</p><br><p>One of the first bloody streams near the bridge abruptly came to an end. Just a second ago it was actively beating and full of energy.</p><br><p>The Phantoms protecting the bridge looked at each other, their faces full of confusion. Even though it was dangerous, they couldn't resist the urge to go over and see what was below.</p><br><br><p>One of them shouted, tugging his comrade by the shoulder.</p><br><p>"This could be a trap. We must wait for information before we can spring into action!"</p><br><p>"But, we're defending the bridge! If anyone should find out what's below, it should be us!"</p><br><p>The sturdy man looked around, hoping to see understanding in the eyes of his mates.</p><br><p>"Come on, the sooner we do this the sooner we can get back to our original task. I doubt it's a trap, but there could be a monster in there. In that case, I need you guys!"</p><br><p>After a moment, several Phantoms nodded slightly. They weren't completely sure of their decision, but their agreement gave courage to the others.</p><br><br><p>Step by step they approached the hollow left behind by the first stream, it was neither large nor small - if they were careless they would all fall in it.</p><br><p>The sturdy man threw an approving glance at his fellows and pointed downward.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a shadow passed in front of the man's face. Three dagger-like claws left a wide cut on his chest.</p><br><p>His frightened eyes reflected the lone wing that had accidentally caught him in its path, but it was only a heartbeat away.</p><br><p>With the next flap of its wing, the silhouette soared upward, seemingly aiming to reach the top of the serpent spire.</p><br><p>The phantoms and monsters immediately turned their attention to the sudden appearance, it wasn't long before they noticed that the silhouettes were not one but two - a monster and a human.</p><br><p>The voices of dozens of Operators echoed in the Phantoms' heads, some advising them to run deep into the fortress and others sharing their assumptions.</p><br><p>Yet, one could not take their eyes off the two creatures locked in mortal combat right in the sky, under the darkness of the eclipse, the cold of the ice towers, and the mind-fogging crimson mist.</p><br><p>The unknown monster, the Crimson Monarch had a firm grip on the black-haired young man's throat, his blue eyes as deep as the dark ocean.</p><br><p>Then it was obvious to everyone that it was the Unknown Phantom.</p><br><p>After a few breaths the Operators realized who was the Unknown Phantom, but no sooner did they relay the information to their Phantoms than the Crimson Monarch's voice rang out across the serpent lands.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter... Fall and become my servant!"</p><br><p>With a sudden movement, the Crimson Monarch threw Adam towards one of the ice towers, with enough force that he broke through the previously invulnerable structure with his back.</p><br><p>The northern ice tower snapped in two, soaking in the blood of the Unknown Phantom.</p>
