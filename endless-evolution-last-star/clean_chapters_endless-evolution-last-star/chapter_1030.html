            <h4>Chapter 1030: Feast and Hunt (Part 1)</h4><br><p>There was still a long way to go before the Fallen Ring Castle was fully restored. Hundreds of serpents would need weeks and even months to rebuild the main spots, not to mention the damaged streets and countless houses.
</p><br><p>In the three days that Adam slept, the serpents couldn’t make much progress. The Fallen Ring Castle was still one big battlefield.
</p><br><p>Somehow, only a small fraction of the serpents had begun to work on repairing the buildings. Many were wounded and must be healed, others were helping them and gathering resources for those in need.
</p><br><p>However, Grita, Torz, Heret, and Vorx realized that although Adam’s victory over Arnoth was obvious, they needed to make it official.
</p><br><p>A celebratory feast was a great solution.
</p><br><p>"Damn..." Adam muttered, sitting at the head of the center table.
</p><br><p>Next to him, were Risha and the resistance leaders. Their table was in the middle of the main square, with dozens of others around them. Not all tables were suitable for a feast, many serpents had brought extant tables and chairs from their homes.
</p><br><p>Well, in this case, any surface that could hold food and drink was suitable, even if it was a flat rock or the ground.
</p><br><p>The decorations weren’t as important as the spirit and reason for their feast.
</p><br><p>"Khm." Heret coughed as he glanced over to Vorx.
</p><br><p>They stood up simultaneously, holding goblets of purple liquid in their hands. It wasn’t wine, but it looked like it.
</p><br><p>In an instant, silence spread across the square as serpents directed their gazes at the two leaders.
</p><br><p>Heret raised his goblet. "I’m sure you’re all eager to move on to the feast to enjoy the food and drink, but let me take a brief moment of your time."
</p><br><p>"You all know that the past few months have not been easy for us, but we have managed to withstand," Vorx continued as he pointed to Adam and Risha. "Thanks to our unusual alliance, we managed to avenge the queen and king. We defeated Arnoth, and Kreyna and destroyed the Light Legion!"
</p><br><br><p>Heret stood up in his chair, deftly lifting Adam behind him.
</p><br><p>"Let us hold this feast remembering our king and queen, let us hold this feast in honor of our hero, Adam!"
</p><br><p>Hundreds of serpents simultaneously raised their goblets, exclaiming along with Heret.
</p><br><p>"Glory to the king!"
</p><br><p>"Glory to our hero!"
</p><br><p>"Glory to our warriors!"
</p><br><p>Each chose their priority, but for most it was Adam.
</p><br><p>He could feel how many gazes were directed towards him as powerful monsters compared to ordinary K3-Phantoms, saluted him.
</p><br><p>If it wasn’t for him, Arnoth’s patience would come to an end at some point. He couldn’t wait indefinitely for the arrival of a strong Phantom, so he would simply kill all the serpents along with Kreyna. The serpents understood this, thus, their gratitude was genuine.
</p><br><p>The only one who was unhappy with the situation was Risha, strangely enough.
</p><br><p>She puffed up her cheeks with her arms crossed over her chest.
</p><br><p>"Pffft, as always, you get all the glory!" she snorted. "I fought too! And, I won!"
</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head awkwardly. He had nothing to say, even if he wanted to, there was no way he could give her the credit.
</p><br><p>"Hah!" Vorx laughed, raising his goblet. "Alright, in that case, I’ll drink to you!"
</p><br><p>With her entire appearance, Risha showed that she didn’t care, but a slight, happy smile betrayed her true emotions.
</p><br><p>"Well..." Adam sat back in his seat, looking at the various dishes filling the table. "Is this even edible?"
</p><br><p>It was worth realizing that Adam and Risha were the only two humans among hundreds of monsters. What the serpents fed on, other than energy, was hardly edible to humans, even if they were Phantoms.
</p><br><p>Feeling his doubts, Heret nodded slightly.
</p><br><p>"Sure, I understand your doubts, and they are well-founded. Unfortunately, most of the dishes will not be to your or Risha’s taste. Well, you can try it if you want. Hah, this is the first time we’re arranging something like this with humans."
</p><br><br><p>Heret cut off a large piece of meat and placed it on Adam’s plate.
</p><br><p>"I’m sure if the meat is non-poisonous and fresh, it can be eaten by humans and monsters alike, can’t it?"
</p><br><p>Adam glanced at the roasted piece of meat that looked like a quality steak in an expensive restaurant, just very large and with a slight purple tint.
</p><br><p>"Hmm, I’m not going to hide it. This looks pretty good. At least much better than this," he pointed at Vorx.
</p><br><p>"Argh?" Vorx frowned. In front of him was a pot with burning lava and black maggots trying to escape.
</p><br><p>Despite the completely unappetizing sight, Vorx ate them one by one like a favorite snack.
</p><br><p>"This is actually delicious! You should try it too!"
</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, then he ran into a problem. The serpents didn’t use cutlery.
</p><br><p>If something needed to be cut, they had claws for that, and they just drank hot soup straight from the bowl.
</p><br><p>"Hah, it’s not like I have a choice, right?" Adam shrugged and, with a deft movement, ripped off a piece of meat.
</p><br><p>He took the first bite, and his eyes went wide.
</p><br><p>The last time he’d felt this way was when he was at the Red Feast by Magnus’s invitation. There, powerful people and Phantoms had the opportunity to taste monster meat.
</p><br><p>But, he was much weaker then. Only the rarest and highest-grade Red Feasts could have the meat of the Red Threat Level monsters or higher.
</p><br><p>Obviously, Adam didn’t have the chance to taste the meat of such strong monsters until now.
</p><br><p>"What do you think?" Heret asked while eating the red roots of some strange plant. Even when cooked, it was so hot that steam was coming up in heavy streams.
</p><br><p>Adam nodded. "Not bad, not bad at all. It’s not exactly what I’m used to, but it’s a unique experience."
</p><br><p>"Hah, good to hear. By the way, what are you going to do about that little problem of yours?" Heret pointed to Adam’s left arm.
</p><br><p>Before Adam could answer, Heret smirked.
</p><br><p>"Don’t you want to go hunting? Vorx and I have an idea, I’m sure you’ll like it."</p>
