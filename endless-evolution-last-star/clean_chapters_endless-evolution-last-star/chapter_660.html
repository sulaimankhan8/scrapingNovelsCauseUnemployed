            <br><p>"What's going on...?" Silvana muttered with her eyes wide open.</p><br><p>She blinked a few times to make sure she wasn't dreaming - Adam was actually right in front of her, Talna and Abel had disappeared to an unknown destination.</p><br><p>What's more, the connection to them as their Operators was gone, her NEP and other devices were no longer working.</p><br><p>Realizing that Obsidian Hydra had done all of this, Silvana turned around sharply to see what happened to the monster.</p><br><p>If she could finish Obsidian Hydra quickly, nothing else would be a threat to Adam.</p><br><p>At least that's what Silvana thought until she saw Obsidian Hydra.</p><br><br><p>Her face turned as pale as a piece of paper. The Obsidian Hydra had become a huge shadow engulfed in darkness, and instead of one remaining head, the monster now had five, multiple eyes staring at Silvana with predatory intentions.</p><br><p>Rumble. Rumble. Rumble.</p><br><p>Your journey continues with My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>A rumble of heavy stomping sounded from above, turning around once more, Silvana saw dozens of Obsidian Spiders and Lizards heading straight for them.</p><br><p>"No... Why did this happen?" Silvana's eyes filled with despair.</p><br><p>She realized that they underestimated the Obsidian Hydra, that the spatial explosion caused such unpredictable consequences.</p><br><p>Moreover... the monsters running straight at them were coming from the third and fourth levels, the reason why their squad passed those monsters was precisely Silvana's fault.</p><br><p>The only thing Silvana couldn't understand was how Obsidian Hydra had recovered all its heads and grown two new ones, but that was no longer important.</p><br><br><p>Silvana fell to her knees, her eyes consumed with despair. Her mind and experience told her that she couldn't do it alone, considering she wasn't at the peak of her strength after a long battle.</p><br><p>But... as soon as Silvana cast a glance at Adam, at his terrified face, her eyes regained their light.</p><br><p>'Right, how can I give up early if he's here? His legs are shaking but he keeps standing, unlike me...'</p><br><br><p>Silvana swung her scissors, split them into two blades, and stood in front of Adam.</p><br><p>"Don't be afraid Adam, I will protect you. I don't know how we got it so wrong, but I won't let those fucking monsters even touch you!"</p><br><p>Then, after a few seconds when the lizards and spiders approached and Silvana was ready to rush into battle, Adam's eyes changed. She couldn't see it, but there was no longer fear in his gaze, only mild curiosity.</p><br><p>To him, monsters were no longer a threat, but Silvana didn't know that and that is how it was supposed to be.</p><br><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh... "</p><br><p>Breathing heavily, Silvana was still standing in front of Adam, going to protect him from the Obsidian Hydra. Her entire body was covered in blood, and hundreds of cut-apart monsters lay around her.</p><br><p>Her scissors were one piece, but not because it was more effective for fighting against a cluster of enemies, but because Silvana lost her left arm in the middle of the battle.</p><br><p>Clots of dark blood flew downward, crashing to the cold ground.</p><br><p>Her right eye was closed due to a severe chemical burn - one of the spiders' venomous spit hit directly into her face, leaving a serious wound on the right side.</p><br><p>Cuts and bites from the monsters' powerful jaws were all over her body, but she continued to stand on her feet, confident but trembling because of how exhausted she was by this point.</p><br><p>In a way, Silvana fulfilled her promise, for unlike her, Adam's body didn't have a single wound, not even a scratch or a drop of blood.</p><br><p>"It'll be alright Adam, all I have left to do is defeat one more monster..." Silvana whispered, slowly raising her scissors, the sharp tip covered in blood aimed at the Obsidian Hydra.</p><br><p>It was obvious to her that her bold speech had nothing to do with reality, but she couldn't afford to appear weak in front of her Operator.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Obsidian Hydra, headed forward, shaking the ground under its massive weight. After a few slow but long strides, the Obsidian Hydra stopped, raising its five heads high.</p><br><p>Soon, energy traveled through the monster's entire body, channeling along its five necks.</p><br><p>Silvana had already seen this attack, so she knew what was coming next - Obsidian Hydra would shoot an energy laser at them.</p><br><p>Her strength was already running low, and she certainly didn't have the right abilities or methods to protect Adam from such a powerful attack.</p><br><p>However... What else could she do but stand in front of him until the very end?</p><br><p>Five purple flashes reverberated upwards as the Obsidian Hydra opened its jaws.</p><br><p>At the same moment, five thin lasers merged into one, heading straight for Silvana at tremendous speed.</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Silvana thrust her scissors forward and used all her energy to create a ghostly copy of her weapon.</p><br><p>There was no thought in her mind of escaping or dodging putting Adam in danger, though with her speed she was capable of doing so.</p><br><p>'No, even if I run away now, what's the point? What will I do next, knowing that I failed to protect my Operator the one time I needed to?'</p><br><p>A bright purple light filled everything around her, allowing Silvana to sink deeper into her thoughts.</p><br><p>'I failed as a Phantom... No, I failed as a worthy partner...'</p><br><p>The laser collided with the scissors quickly glowing them to a maximum temperature, turning them into molten clots, falling to the ground like chunks of metal.</p><br><p>Soon, the hot laser reached the hilt, about to destroy the last thing left of Silvana's weapon and then her.</p><br><p>'Shit! This way I can't block even a fraction of the damage! No! Can't... even at the cost of my own life I can't protect it!'</p><br><p>An inner scream erupted deep inside Silvana as she felt something touch her single hand.</p><br><p>A bright light appeared from the side, Silvana slowly turned her head only to see Adam and his serene eyes.</p><br><p>"Calm down, we can handle this, together."</p><br><p>His voice possessed a confidence that Silvana as Phantom was far from, she was sure that this was not how the Operator could sound, this was not the Adam she knew.</p><br><br><p>Adam uttered as he gripped Silvana's hand tightly and a long handle appeared between their palms, forming into a silver needle.</p>
