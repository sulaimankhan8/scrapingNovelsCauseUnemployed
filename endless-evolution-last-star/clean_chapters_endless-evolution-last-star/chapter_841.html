            <br><p>The Evolution Tree was not in Adam's inner space under Queen Elisa, however, the Stellar Flow needed to reach the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>Thus, Adam's inner space changed rapidly, returning to its original state. It affected his aura and energy that nothing else held back.</p><br><p>Dense energy streams rushed from his body, surging in all directions. The influence of the Queen Elisa quickly released Adam - her help was no longer needed.</p><br><p>As soon as the bright flash illuminated the entire island, Seyrina's and Douglas's eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>Upon realizing the situation, Douglas turned around, looking at Silvana, a slight panic in his gaze.</p><br><p>"Fuck, Seyrina, protect Silvana! Adam's energy is too intense, this kind of activity will only hurt her!"</p><br><p>Without a moment's hesitation, Seyrina nodded and rushed to Silvana's aid. Her eyes shone brightly as her energy became frosty, gradually turning into ice crystals.</p><br><p>Before Adam's energy streams reached Silvana about to completely engulf her, Seyrina swung her hand, invoking an ice barrier.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide as the majestic energy crashed into the dense layer of ice. No matter how hard the energy tried to reach Silvana, it could not succeed.</p><br><p>Then, Seyrina's eyes darted to the side - Adam's energy was tearing the edges of her barrier into shards.</p><br><p>"Holy shit..." Seyrina gulped, "He's only a K2-Phantom, or rather he was... The energy is dense, but that's not the point, it can't compare to mine, after all, I'm a K4-Phantom. But... its amount, it's abnormal.''</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Seyrina lowered her gaze, pondering what was going on. She realized that there was too much energy coming out of Adam - it should happen at the end, but not with such force and pressure.</p><br><p>"Hmm..." Seyrina rumbled thoughtfully while simultaneously restoring the ice barrier, "It feels like he's been saving that energy for months or even years, but... is that possible?"</p><br><p>The confused Silvana looked around. She didn't fear for her life, but deep inside, she was scared, she hoped Adam would be safe.</p><br><p>Searching for answers, she looked at Douglas, as her pupils dilated in disbelief.</p><br><p>While Seyrina, the K4-Phantom had to protect her because she was the Operator, Douglas stood confidently on his feet in proud solitude.</p><br><p>Adam's energy hit him, the harsh whips, but Douglas stayed in a place like a mountain.</p><br><p>It was the second time Silvana saw such a thing in Douglas's performance.</p><br><p>'There's something wrong with him...' she thought, 'First it was Damien's aura, now Adam's energy. He's not even trying to hide that it's not a problem for him.</p><br><p>Naturally, the thought reappeared in Silvana's mind that Douglas might secretly be a Phantom. She wouldn't be surprised, but something deep inside her was telling her that Douglas wasn't a Phantom.</p><br><p>'No...' Silvana muttered to herself, 'I don't know why, but I can feel it. Looking at Seyrina or Adam I can safely say they are Phantoms, but Douglas... Who the hell are you?'</p><br><p>Observing Adam's energy Silvana shuddered. She realized that she never had this ability before: to separate Phantoms and non-Phantoms.</p><br><p>She didn't know when she learned it, just now or after Gene Diffusion, but she had no doubt it had happened not too long ago.</p><br><p>'It seems the changes in me are only just beginning.'</p><br><p>Silvana pressed her palm to her chest, with a serious expression. Despite the dangerous situation, she found peace within herself.</p><br><p>The energy flows continued to hit the ice barrier, if not for Seyrina's help, there was no telling what would happen to Silvana - she had to stay as far away from Adam's energy as possible. After all, she was no stronger than a regular human in her normal state.</p><br><p>However... Soon something in her gaze changed. Her eyes grew deeper, mesmerized by the scene before her - an endless stream sought to engulf her like a major treasure, and... she couldn't resist it.</p><br><br><p>Without warning, Silvana stepped forward intending to step beyond the barrier, to let the energy stream sweep her, to show that she belonged to Adam.</p><br><p>Seyrina's eyes went wide, but she didn't have time to stop Silvana, she noticed it too late.</p><br><p>'No! You idiot, what are you doing?!' Seyrina inwardly exclaimed as she twitched.</p><br><br><p>At the last moment, a strong hand grabbed Silvana's wrist, bringing her out of the trance.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Silvana's eyes were no longer blank, she came back to normal.</p><br><p>Slowly, she directed her gaze upward, looking at Douglas, who with a serious face stood before her at the edge of the barrier.</p><br><p>Adam's energy was hitting his robust torso with all its might, but he seemed not to notice it, wanting to save Silvana.</p><br><br><p>His stern voice reached her ears.</p><br><p>"I recognize your devotion, but something is happening to Adam. Apparently, it's the result of him being in a confined space for too long."</p><br><p>Reluctantly, Douglas turned around, directing his stern gaze at Adam, his energy still at peak strength.</p><br><p>"Now, his energy will tear you apart - it will be a tragedy for both him and you. I'm sure no one wants that to happen."</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Douglas's words brought Silvana to her senses. With a shiver full of fear, she took a step back, returning to the safe place behind Seyrina.</p><br><p>"I understood..." she muttered, "I don't know what it was, I just wanted to merge with the flow, join Adam..."</p><br><p>Douglas wasn't going to scold her, for he realized that she wasn't in control of that urge. Instead, he looked at Queen Elisa, sadness reflected on his face.</p><br><p>"Perhaps it is Adam's power's effect on you, or maybe the queen decided to test your loyalty."</p><br><p>Thus, about ten minutes passed until Adam's energy finally stopped flowing out of his body.</p><br><p>Douglas, Seyrina, and Silvana glanced around. They weren't sure what was happening to Adam, but it was obvious that there wasn't much time left.</p><br><p>They didn't risk getting too close to Adam. It wasn't even about his strength, Seyrina and Douglas had nothing to fear, but about his connection to the queen.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Adam watched as the boundaries of his inner space became more precise. Everything was returning to normal, there was no longer a view of Silvana or Queen Elisa, only vast darkness.</p><br><p>It didn't take long for a bright light from outside to appear - the Evolution Tree showed itself.</p><br><p>The edges of the Initial Gene were red and purple, indicating that Moira and Line Blaze were here, everything was as it should be.</p><br><p>Within seconds, all the key details returned to the inner space - the only difference was the Second Key hovering in the very center like a majestic constellation in space.</p><br><br><p>The rumble of the powerful stream quickly took the smile off Adam's face, forcing him to look up at the Stellar Flow.</p><br><p>He didn't know what to do, it seemed that soon the flow would destroy him, swept away in its darkness.</p><br><br><p>No sooner had the flow gone far than it stopped as if it had hit an invisible wall.</p><br><p>Narrowing his eyes, Adam was able to discern the tiny stars coming from the Second Key, they formed a barely visible barrier preventing the stream from going any farther.</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree's voice rang out, reaching Adam's mind.</p><br><p>For the first few seconds, Adam froze in place. He didn't hear the Evolution Tree's voice for so long that he was used to it. He thought it was someone else's, but gradually he remembered.</p><br><br><p>With a bitter smile, Adam turned around, glaring at his closest ally.</p><br><p>"You arrogant bastard... Where have you been all this time? Do you even know what I've been through?"</p><br><p>There was no anger in Adam's voice, for he was glad to finally stop being alone. Loneliness didn't bother him, he just didn't have time to think about it because of the endless defeats and victories, but it was always good to be back home.</p><br><p>[Ghah... I don't know what was going on with you, but... I can see it in your eyes. Moreover... Do you know that you've changed a lot?]</p><br><p>"Agh? What do you mean?"</p><br><p>Instead of an answer, the Evolution Tree shuddered, directing a stream of energy towards Adam. The energy stopped in front of him in a tattered, smooth slice - clean and dense enough to show him a reflection.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, looking at himself in disbelief.</p><br><p>In front of him was his weaker, thinner version of himself who lost dozens of pounds with hair long almost to his waist.</p><br><p>Carefully, he touched his back, feeling the dense curls.</p><br><p>"What the hell...? Wait... Wasn't everything that happened in that space supposed to stay there?"</p><br><p>[Hmm... I'm afraid I don't know all the details this time... but... The Second Key changed, which means you're no exception either.]</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly, slowly turning towards the Second Key.</p><br><p>Its energy stopped flowing, yet the Second Key did nothing, waiting for Adam to make a decision.</p><br><p>[Go ahead Adam... Use the Second Key... then, you will see what lies ahead...]</p><br><p>"What lies ahead...?"</p><br><p>Under his whisper, Adam turned around, looking over his shoulder at the Stellar Flow in an unsuccessful attempt to move forward.</p><br><p>Adam didn't know what this power was, but it was different from gathering genes, the initial monster, or the two walls.</p><br><p>Once again, he was to face new challenges - the thought of it ignited a flame in him.</p><br><p>After defeating the Crimson Monarch, Adam felt a deep calm, now he remembered that this was not his last fight, there was a long road ahead.</p><br><p>With a glint in his eyes, Adam found himself standing next to the Second Key, taking it by the hilt like a great sword.</p><br><p>"I don't know what happens next, what this flow is, but... like I have any other choice. I find out what's going on here, and I'll go straight to the Lower Ring, from the very top to the rock bottom!"</p><br><p>Unable to wait any longer, Adam smirked, throwing the key right into the base of the Evolution Tree.</p>
