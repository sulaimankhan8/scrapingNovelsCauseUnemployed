            <br><p>In one swift movement, the Noukx Family youth was behind the girl, leaving two diagonal cuts on her chest.</p><br><p>Ice particles flew off to the sides, in front of her shocked eyes full of pain.</p><br><br><p>The young man returned the daggers to his belt and stepped aside confidently.</p><br><p>Unlike the head of his family, Kogen Noukx, he didn't look crazy and acted with complete seriousness.</p><br><p>"That was a good fight!" the young man exclaimed and bowed low.</p><br><p>The girl was breathing heavily, her wounds weren't serious enough for her to pass out, but it was pointless to continue the fight.</p><br><p>The winner was obvious.</p><br><p>"Yes... You're right..." she muttered resentfully biting her lip, "I give up... I couldn't even scratch you."</p><br><p>At the same moment, the observer's powerful voice rang out:</p><br><p>"The winner is Vagen Noukx!!! He already has four twilight coins! Perhaps soon we will see Vagen leave the Twilight Palace with a perfect score!" the man pointed at the young man.</p><br><p>One by one, the nobles began to clap, but there was no joy in Vagen's eyes, for he was fighting for one purpose - to get the attention of someone special.</p><br><p>Throwing a glance upwards, Vagen saw that the young man with hair as white as snow had left the audience seats.</p><br><p>A moment later, the young man was already downstairs, heading away down the wide aisle.</p><br><p>Forgetting to even take his twilight coins from the observer, Vagen rushed forward trying to reach the mysterious young man.</p><br><p>"Wait! You're Reinz... Reinz Alderran, right?"</p><br><p>The young man looked at Vagen over his shoulder, with no interest in his gaze.</p><br><p>"Yes, Reinz is my name. Do you need something offspring of the Noukx Family?"</p><br><p>Vagen gulped, seeming to gather strength for it.</p><br><p>"To fight... I want to fight against you! You have four twilight coins like me, right?"</p><br><p>"Forget it. I'm not interested in twilight coins or perfect scores, all I want is a decent fight. You can't give me that."</p><br><p>Without further ado, Reinz moved on. He had nothing more to say to Vagen.</p><br><p>However, Vagen wasn't going to give up so soon. He decided to take the risk.</p><br><br><p>Vagen pulled the daggers from his belt, attacking Reinz from the back.</p><br><p>Was he acting sneakily?</p><br><br><p>"I'm attacking!" Vagen exclaimed midway through his move, not wanting to have an unfair victory.</p><br><p>Fighting at the Twilight Palace was not forbidden. The observers were only needed to make the fights official, because only for such fights could the participants get a twilight coin - a bet.</p><br><p>Adam was not punished for what he did to Kenna, so Vagen had nothing to fear as well.</p><br><p>Except the wrath of his opponent, if that was even a possibility.</p><br><br><p>Reinz stepped back, letting Vagen leap in front of him, daggers cleaving only the air.</p><br><p>"Hey..." Reinz wheezed, "I wasn't fooling you. Our fight couldn't be interesting."</p><br><p>With a loud crack, Reinz's foot plunged into Vagen's stomach, crashing from below the top.</p><br><p>The impact threw Vagen up a few meters.</p><br><p>Their gazes met - each could continue the fight after the small clash that ended in Reinz's favor.</p><br><p>Vagen crossed his daggers in front of him, the blue flames bursting from the blades much stronger, he used much more energy than in his recent fight.</p><br><p>White electric shocks traveled through Reinz's body.</p><br><p>The fight was ready to move into the active phase, it brought a satisfied smile to Vagen's face. He didn't know whether he would win or lose, but he achieved his goal.</p><br><p>But... soon only disappointment awaited him.</p><br><p>Reinz's frame shuddered as he turned into a flash fading into the distance. Before Vagen could realize anything, Reinz was already beyond his line of sight, after taking several turns.</p><br><p>Sure, if Vagen needed it badly, he could find Reinz. After all, there weren't many people at the Twilight Palace, especially from the Alderran Family.</p><br><p>"Fuck..." Vagen muttered falling to the ground.</p><br><p>He glanced around, looking sadly at the crowd waiting for the spectacle.</p><br><p>"What is he waiting for? He's already been here for a month..."</p><br><p>There were similar discussions among the nobles, for every Phantom from the Alderran Family that appeared at the Twilight Palace attracted a lot of attention.</p><br><p>At the first wing, unlike the other wings, there were four ruling families - the Lorenzo Family, the Hurxo Family, the Valthorn Family, and the Alderran Family.</p><br><p>In theory, they were equal to each other, but in noble society, it was well-known which family held what position.</p><br><p>For families from other wings, it was clear - the number depended on the wing. However, at the first wing, there was serious competition for power and territory, space was scarce, and all four families were powerful.</p><br><p>The Alderran Family was the first family of the twelve great families, which meant that its members had as many obligations as they did influence.</p><br><p>It was the younger generation that had the hardest time. The only way to maintain their position of leadership was to wield superior power. That required Phantoms, strong and talented, with a flame burning in their eyes.</p><br><p>This produced in the Alderran Family either traumatized individuals whose morals had been destroyed by their own family, or geniuses to be praised, predicted to become a Second Rank Phantoms one day.</p><br><p>Naturally, Reinz was one of the talented ones, but his path had already reached a rather distant point - K3-Level.</p><br><p>At this level, his family's influence became less, because most of those who had pressured him before were now weaker than him.</p><br><p>Sure, K3-Level was not the limit for ranks within the first great family, but high-ranking members rarely controlled the actions of talents like Reinz.</p><br><p>The reason was simple. High nobles like Reinz had already decided on their path, they were willing to follow it, otherwise they would never reach a K3-Level.</p><br><p>Destroying the Two Walls was not a task most people could handle.</p><br><br><p>With a cold stare, Reinz was stepping forward when a female voice resounded in his head:</p><br><p>'Hey... That guy from the Noukx Family is right. How long do you plan on staying here? You only need one victory!'</p><br><p>Reinz looked up at the bright, crystal chandelier illuminating another crossroad.</p><br><p>"As long as it takes."</p>
