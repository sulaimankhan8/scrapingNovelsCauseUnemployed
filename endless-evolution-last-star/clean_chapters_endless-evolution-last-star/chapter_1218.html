            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1218: Cruel Sun (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Fromund and Adam’s Nexuses were similar. Their weapons did not immediately reveal their full power, and in order to reach the final stage, Fromund and Adam had to pay a certain price.</p><br><p>For Adam, the conditions were harsher. His Nexus put serious pressure on his body, which could easily cause critical damage. However, unlike Fromund, he could use his Nexus at any time if he was ready to face the consequences.</p><br><p>Fromund, on the other hand, had to wait. His spear worked the same way as Adam’s rods. The longer he fought, the more energy, clashes, and injuries there were around him and his enemies, the hotter his spear became.</p><br><p>Each stage was represented by a new ring around his spear, and unlike Adam’s Nexus with 5 rings, 3 rings were the limit for Fromund.</p><br><p>During their long mission, Fromund used two modes of his spear. Usually, that was the limit, because to activate the third ring, he had to be in a tough situation.</p><br><p>Well, Moroya and the two princes forced him to do so. No matter how talented Fromund was, he was like a K4-Phantom with just a Path Construct and simply couldn’t fight on equal terms against three Elders.</p><br><p>It’s not certain that he would have defeated Moroya in a one-on-one battle, but when she was assisted by the Silver and Amber Princes, he had virtually no chance.</p><br><p>That would have been true if Fromund had already used all his trump cards, but that wasn’t the case.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Fromund’s spear shook violently as the Silver Prince jumped sharply to the side. He didn’t try to stop Fromund from attacking or strike faster, the Silver Prince felt the pain from the heat simply because he was close.</p><br><p>The first to realize that something was wrong was Moroya.</p><br><p>Her rich experience and keen instincts told her that this attack was not like anything Fromund had used before.</p><br><p>“Alright, you have strong bodies, but that doesn’t mean you’re invulnerable!” Fromund exclaimed, holding his spear with both hands.</p><br><p>In a panic, Moroya waved her hand.</p><br><p>“Fuck! Run!” She exclaimed as her energy rushed forward to create a protective barrier in front of the Amber Prince.</p><br><p>However… their attempts were now meaningless.</p><br><p>They didn’t realize it at the time, but their best course of action would have been to respond to Fromund’s attack with one of their own, perhaps even stronger.</p><br><p>All the flames of the spear, at Fromund’s will, rushed forward in a single stream to explode in a destructive ray.</p><br><p>The Kirani Bugs that were too close, watching from the sidelines, didn’t even have time to understand how their lives had ended before their bodies turned into handfuls of ash.</p><br><p>The flame ray didn’t need to hit them, just as the sun didn’t need to touch anything to burn it. The intense heat was enough.</p><br><p>But… those who were about to face the flame ray directly awaited a much worse fate.</p><br><p>Moroya’s barrier shattered into fragments in an instant, it had no strength against Fromund’s attack. Next, the Amber Prince tried to defend himself by raising his spear, but it was not enough.</p><br><br><p>Melting the sturdy chitin, the flame ray burned through the Amber Prince’s torso, leaving a wide hole the size of a cannonball in the monster. The edges of the charred flesh emitted wisps of smoke under the Amber Prince’s incredulous gaze.</p><br><br><p>Fromund raised his spear as the flame ray destroyed everything above the Amber Prince’s waist, but his attack did not end there.</p><br><p>As long as Fromund had energy, he could use the flame ray.</p><br><p>“Hahaha! This was easier than I thought! Come on, Queen! If you don’t hurry, I’ll turn the second one to ash too!”</p><br><p>With these words, Fromund aimed his spears at the Silver Prince, who stood confusedly to the side.</p><br><p>Despite being able to easily fight against several Lesser Elders, the Silver Prince simply didn’t know what to do. He had no way to defend himself against Fromund’s flame ray, which moved slowly toward him like a laser from a cannon.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Moroya rushed forward, her wings shining brightly.</p><br><p>Before the flame ray could reach the Silver Prince and injure him, she appeared in front of him, her wings spread wide.</p><br><p>“Don’t worry, my boy, I’ll protect you,” Moroya said gently, creating a complex barrier in front of her, consisting of more than a dozen other barriers.</p><br><p>One layer of amber energy was superimposed on another, forming a complex structure that required a considerable amount of Moroya’s strength.</p><br><p>Fromund didn’t believe that Moroya could protect herself, but when the flame ray hit the barrier, something happened that he couldn’t have expected.</p><br><p>“Agh…?” Fromund blinked several times in disbelief.</p><br><p>His ray was reflected as if a laser had hit a mirror, heading high into the sky.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>On its way, the flame ray burned through dozens of meters of rock and earth, leaving a tunnel wide enough for a train to pass through, eventually emerging to the surface with a fiery explosion.</p><br><p>But Moroya and the Silver Prince remained unharmed.</p><br><p>‘Shit,’ Fromund thought to himself as he clenched his fists tightly.</p><br><p>This was a big problem for him because he had hoped to deal with the two princes with this attack and then defeat Moroya in a one-on-one battle.</p><br><p>“It’s okay.” Moroya touched the Silver Prince’s shoulder. “But to defeat this Phantom, you need to become stronger, and… I will help you.”</p><br><p>Moroya reached out her hand toward the remains of the Amber Prince, as her energy absorbed everything that was left of him.</p><br><p>It was a little, but enough for a dense orb full of energy to rise between her palms, like a farewell gift from one brother to another.</p><br><p>‘What the hell is going on?!’ Fromund exclaimed inwardly. ‘This queen… What are these terrifying abilities?!’</p><br><br><p>“Here we go…” she muttered before placing her palms on the Silver Prince’s chest, filling his body with a new surge of energy.</p><br><p>Now, Fromund would have to fight hard just to survive, let alone win.</p>
