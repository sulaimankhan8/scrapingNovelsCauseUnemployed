            <br><p>"And what do we have? Two wounds on one side and two wounds on the other. First Order and First Order. Now, there are Artifact and Artifact. Those two aren’t going to reveal the winner ahead of time, are they?"
</p><br><p>Zarot crossed his arms over his chest, staring intently at the two fighters. Deep inside he felt annoyed that he did not influence anything, but the others were in the same position.
</p><br><p>Among the many, Nirosh was the only one who looked at Osana every so often, his palm on his face, fingers spread wide.
</p><br><p>"He will win... Fromund will win and you will return to me. If he doesn’t, then... I will surely find a way to make him regret it..." Nirosh muttered.
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, he stopped glaring at Osana who was closely watching the development of the fight, and looked at Elva, Liv, and Tilda.
</p><br><p>’Yeah, if I lose my treasure because of him, then he should face the same fate.’
</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, as Nirosh’s gaze lingered on Tilda, Erik tapped his cane once on the ground.
</p><br><br><br><p>Deafening pain was the only thing Nirosh could feel, his blood clotting badly, it seemed that just a little more and his circulation would break down and his heart explode from the excessive pressure.
</p><br><p>Wide-eyed, Nirosh clutched at his chest, wanting to regain his normal state.
</p><br><br><p>Relief came as quickly as the suffocating emptiness came.
</p><br><p>Tilda looked at Erik puzzled, her eyes full of curiosity: "Why did you tap with your cane? If you’re not comfortable standing you can take my seat, I don’t mind."
</p><br><p>Naively, Tilda thought that Erik was shy and therefore stood apart from the others. It was something only a pure, innocent mind could think of.
</p><br><p>Looking at Tilda over his shoulder, Erik let out a short chuckle.
</p><br><p>"Hahaha, how caring you are. I’m already starting to envy your brother."
</p><br><p>Erik shook his head, holding tightly onto his cane.
</p><br><p>"Don’t worry, I’m more than comfortable and I tapped my cane just because I wanted to, just to feel the rhythm, you know?"
</p><br><p>Tilda touched her bottom lip, looking at him baffled.
</p><br><p>"I’ve seen grandfathers walk with canes most of the time, but you don’t look like an old person."
</p><br><p>"Hey, is that a compliment or not? Although I won’t hide it, I’m not the youngest, I’ve already spent this treasure unlike you or your brother."
</p><br><p>Trying to understand what the older man was talking about, Tilda looked up.
</p><br><p>"Youth, is it a treasure?"
</p><br><p>In response, Erik nodded convincingly.
</p><br><p>"Yes, it definitely is. It is one of the greatest treasures, I can state that confidently, but... it is one of the most cunning treasures."
</p><br><p>"A cunning treasure...?"
</p><br><p>Erik smiled bitterly, gazing at the active, light rays from the rising sun, it was like all spectators wished to see what was happening in the arena, at least a small glimpse.
</p><br><p>"You only realize the full value of youth when it is already passed and unlike most treasures, you don’t have the opportunity to return it. So, never forget it."
</p><br><p>Tilda blinked a few times, her gray eyes were wide open, she was listening to Erik intently, but it was hard for her to fully understand him. After all, she was about to touch what Erik had gone through years ago.
</p><br><p>"But... How to find that youth? How do you see this treasure to know what it looks like and not lose sight of it?"
</p><br><p>Perhaps someone would laugh at Tilda’s question as she took Erik’s words literally. Youth was not a chest of gold or a gemstone for it someone could see or touch. It was something ephemeral and complex, being on another plane from physical things.
</p><br><p>Nevertheless, Erik had a precise and quick answer.
</p><br><p>"Tilda, just open your eyes wider, for the clearest manifestation of youth, active and intense is happening right in front of us."
</p><br><p>Erik removed his right hand from his cane, pointing at the two young men, scarlet flames spreading across the body of one, making his heart beat harder, while the other was calm and cold, taming the violent lightning bolts running through his body.
</p><br><br><br><p>As if his words were an order or a call to action, at that very moment, Adam turned into a lightning flash.
</p><br><p>’You were stronger than me before you activated your artifact. Now you were able to lift your hammer with one hand without a problem.’ Adam thought for a moment.
</p><br><p>His gaze focused on Fromund.
</p><br><p>’But there’s no point in strength if your speed isn’t fast enough for you to hit me even once!’
</p><br><br><p>Turning to Fromund’s left, with dark, deep eyes heavily contrasting against the bright lightning, Adam swung his needle from top to bottom.
</p><br><p>A wave of shivers went through Fromund’s body as his heartbeat several times with renewed vigor. The more and more he wanted to move, the more pressure the artifact would put on his body, but it also amplified its effect.
</p><br><p>The silver blade swept in front of Fromund’s bright eyes.
</p><br><p>The needle sliced through the ground, leaving a wide gap. Cold air rushed upward in two streams, fluttering Fromund’s hair.
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes moved quickly from right to left, Fromund instinctively dropped his hammer in time to dodge.
</p><br><p>’He didn’t even think for a moment, but this is one of the few times his instincts failed him.’
</p><br><br><p>Facing Fromund in an electric burst, Adam grabbed his hand, to perform an equally swift thrust with his needle.
</p><br><br><p>A stream of blood rushed out, the sharp tip of the needle showing on the other side of Fromund’s back.
</p><br><p>Elva and Liv were horrified, their faces pale.
</p><br><p>But, for some reason, Adam’s face turned pale as well, he saw something that shouldn’t have happened.
</p><br><p>His needle sliced Fromund’s palm, clots of blood ran down his fingers, but... his weapon didn’t pierce Fromund’s torso as Adam planned.
</p><br><p>"Oh, looks like I made it at the last moment, doesn’t it?"
</p><br><p>Fromund smiled bitterly, feeling an unpleasant burning sensation on his right. The needle blade left a deep cut on his side, but if he hadn’t managed to withdraw the needle with his hand, a far worse injury would have awaited him.
</p><br><p>Realizing that this was a failure, Adam hurriedly jumped aside.
</p><br><br><p>Continue your adventure with Freewebnovel
</p><br><p>Adam couldn’t do it, he stayed where he was.
</p><br><p>His gaze lowered, realizing that despite the pain, Fromund had a firm grip on his needle.
</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could react, Fromund released the needle but changed his grip, clutching Adam’s left hand’s wrist.
</p><br><p>Then, his eyes flashed, this time the energy channeled only down his right, wounded arm, coating his fist in hot, violent red flames.
</p><br><p>Fromund smiled widely, there was no anger in his look, only joy that he had succeeded.
</p><br><p>"Now it’s my turn, isn’t it?"</p>
