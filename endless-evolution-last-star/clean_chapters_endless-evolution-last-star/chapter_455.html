            <br><p>"You are in the same situation...? Wait, you're a Phantom, which means you're the Light Noble, shouldn't you have more rights even compared to the other nobles from the Twelve Branches?" Adam asked, he was a bit baffled.</p><br><p>He thought he already figured out how the nobles' society worked, but that was far from the truth.</p><br><p>Experience exclusive tales on empire</p><br><p>Osana sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"Sure, but... when it comes to getting married, then all those things no longer matter, or rather... it matters, but for something else."</p><br><br><p>"The thing is, that the Light Nobles almost always only marry the other Light Nobles, that is, the Phantoms marry the Phantoms."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, before this conversation he knew next to nothing about nobles, but he understood how relationships worked and the rules in families wielding great power and caring for the purity of their blood.</p><br><p>"I assume that nobles, both ordinary families and great ones, marry preferentially only each other, right?"</p><br><br><p>"Sure, more than 90% of marriages are between nobles, if we're talking about the Twelve Branches, we also marry each other, creating strong unions and keeping our bloodlines pure."</p><br><p>Then, Osana looked up at the ceiling taking a deep breath.</p><br><p>"Light Nobles only marry Light Nobles and... that puts Hollow Nobles in a difficult situation."</p><br><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>"Doesn't that mean Hallow Nobles marry each other too, what's the problem here?"</p><br><p>Osana smiled bitterly. Adam's assumption made sense, but he simply knew too little about how high society was structured and what interests and ambitions the people there had.</p><br><p>"Well, for one thing, there may not be enough partners for Hallow Nobles, it happens quite often. In that case, they either stay single forever since they're not allowed to be with non-nobles or... they marry Light Nobles."</p><br><p>Adam tilted, narrowing his eyes and casting a quick glance at Osana.</p><br><p>"Wait...? Isn't that good for them? You just said that Light Nobles only marry other Light Nobles." Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>Osana shook her head.</p><br><p>"Well, yeah, that would greatly increase the status of the Hallow Noble, but... The Hallow Noble won't be the main wife or husband. Hallow Nobles will only be side husbands and wives, sort of like concubines."</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head in confusion.</p><br><p>"Argh... How complicated and strange... So if the Hallow Noble hasn't found a mate among the other nobles, he or she will either remain single or become a concubine, right?"</p><br><br><p>"That's right. Some Light Noble, Phantom Woman, may have a Light Noble husband like her and several other side husbands acting as her concubines, or more simply put, her lovers."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went blank for a moment, it was rather hard for him to imagine it.</p><br><p>"Shouldn't her husband be opposed in such a situation? I mean, even if they are nobles, there can still be love and trust between them, can't there?"</p><br><p>Osana smiled bitterly, but she answered his question positively.</p><br><p>"Sure, it happens, and fortunately not very rare, but Light Nobles can have concubines for several reasons."</p><br><br><p>"Often marriages are arranged for convenience, meaning the husband and wife do not have warm and loving feelings for each other. In that case, they get additional wives and husbands who they like. Their status as the main husband and wife is maintained, the union remains strong, and yet they have people who mean something to them."</p><br><p>Adam wanted to say something, but he didn't have time as Osana beat her to it with her heavy voice.</p><br><p>"But... that's a good one. Sometimes, side wives and husbands are just entertainment for Light Nobles, a way to reinforce their status and sexual desires. And... as you realized, there's a difference between Light Nobles, too."</p><br><p>"Hmm? What do you mean?"</p><br><p>Adam asked, he was puzzled.</p><br><p>"If one Light Noble is the Artificial Phantom and the other is the Natural Phantom, then there is no equality between them."</p><br><p>Osana's gaze darkened as she moved closer to the table.</p><br><p>"Natural Phantom may have many side wives or husbands chosen from Hallow Nobles, but... in that case, the second Light Noble, the one who is Artificial Phantom, will not have that privilege."</p><br><p>Adam shuddered as soon as he visualized this scene.</p><br><p>"Fuck, why is noble society so cruel? I mean, even if you were born into the Twelve Branches and become a Phantom, then you're a Light Noble, you still have the possibility of being in a situation where you're restricted by something or someone, doing something you don't want to do and being humiliated by your partner's actions. And... it all happens at the very top!"</p><br><p>Osana nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yes, you're absolutely right, but I don't want you to think of nobles, especially those of the Twelve Branches as victims. Every single one of them, from Hallow Noble to Light Noble, has vast amounts of money, resources, and power, something that 99% of the people in the Citadel can't even dream of."</p><br><p>Adam smiled slightly. He was glad Osana had said that, as he now had a greater understanding of what kind of person Osana was.</p><br><p>"But, that doesn't mean nobles don't have problems. Now, let's go back to my situation. As you realize, I'm one of the Twelve Branches and I'm a Light Noble. However, I am the Artificial Phantom."</p><br><p>Hearing her words, Adam immediately became more serious. After all, although he had learned a valid amount about nobles and the Twelve Branches, the situation with Osana, was still not fully revealed.</p><br><p>"In a normal situation, I wouldn't have any problems, even considering my willful temper and the fact that I don't want to deal with my family. No one can force me to do anything, but... a few months ago, the only trump card was used against me."</p><br><br><p>"One Light Noble from the Marzo Family liked me, they're in charge in the second wing and have a good relationship with the Rouzet Family. He's the Naturalborn Phantom, so I have no right to refuse."</p><br><p>Then, Osana looked at Adam intently.</p><br><p>"But... Right now, there's one of the best Naturalborn Phantoms of the new generation sitting in front of me, isn't there?"</p><br>
