            <br><p>For a while, Silvana watched the different emotions reflected on Chloe's face.</p><br><p>At first, she was worried, but tears came from her eyes, and she cried and collapsed to the ground.</p><br><p>Initially, Silvana was ready to rush to Chloe to understand what was going on and console her, but she quickly realized that Chloe wasn't upset.</p><br><p>'Wait... These tears...' she internally muttered in disbelief, 'These are tears of happiness. But, what did she see that caused her to react like that?'</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Silvana wasn't surprised, for she several times had experienced the same thing and the reason was always the same - Adam.</p><br><p>Then, Silvana glanced at Erik, her face frowning.</p><br><p>"You... You know what's going on here, don't you?"</p><br><p>"Hah, of course, I am." Erik waved his hand nonchalantly, throwing one leg over the other, "I forbade you from using the shared sight so you wouldn't be distracted from your training, but student bans don't apply to teachers, am I saying that right?"</p><br><p>That didn't answer Silvana's question, but from her experience and history with Adam, she had a rough idea of what had put Chloe in this state.</p><br><br><p>Silvana slumped down in her seat grudgingly crossing her arms over her chest.</p><br><p>"Pffft, if you had told her everything her tears could have been avoided."</p><br><br><p>Erik rested his cheek on his hand, looking at Chloe, who wrapped her arms around her knees, pressing tightly against herself. Her cheeks were red from the flood of tears, but a happy smile shone on her face.</p><br><p>"That's the whole point. I'm sure, their next meeting will be special. Speaking of which." Erik pulled out his phone, picking a place to go, "Silvana, what kind of cuisine do you like? Maybe pizza, pasta, and lasagna?"</p><br><p>"Hmm? Why do you ask?" Silvana raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>"Well, it's just that I think we're going to have dinner outside the house this time. At some cozy restaurant with delicious food. Sounds good, doesn't it?"</p><br><p>Before Silvana could reply, Erik sent a message and continued,</p><br><p>"It's going to be a great evening, for the four of us."</p><br><p>'Wait what?' Silvana was confused, 'For the four of us?'</p><br><br><p>Julia brought the injured Adam to Erik. He quickly healed the wounded young man, then Adam and Silvana exchanged a few phrases.</p><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply everything happened just as she had envisioned.</p><br><p>"Hah... You can be quite cruel sometimes, can't you?" Silvana bit her lip predatorily.</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head awkwardly, "I figured this was the best option."</p><br><p>He leaned on the edge of the seat, looking at Chloe in the distance.</p><br><p>"First, I tried using strength and pride as motivation. Then, I decided to use the fact that he was a high nobleman, I said a lot about his family. But..."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes narrowed watching Chloe.</p><br><p>"None of that had any effect. So the only thing left was her.</p><br><p>"If this is the real Phantom, and nothing previously said can hit the depths, then that means it's the Operator who's most important to him."</p><br><p>Silvana's hands found themselves on his shoulders, moving to his formerly slashed chest.</p><br><p>"Hmm..." she hummed resting her head on his shoulder, "Did you know about Erik's plan? Apparently, he took advantage of your actions to bring Chloe and Reinz closer. What's more... he's up to something else."</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam neither confirmed nor denied her assumption.</p><br><br><p>"I don't care. I didn't know what would happen or that Erik would take advantage of it. I just wanted Reinz to get to my level as soon as possible. After all, I'm very curious to see what the Infusive Energy Control can do and how much stronger I'll be after opening the second lesser gates."</p><br><p>"I see..." Silvana whispered, a faint smile soon appearing on her face.</p><br><br><p>Just like yesterday, one of the Operators was preparing dinner. This time it was Julia.</p><br><p>"Hey! Everyone run to the kitchen! It's time to eat!" Julia's voice carried through the rooms and several floors.</p><br><p>Chloe gulped as she stepped out of her room, expecting to meet Reinz. She saw and heard everything through shared sight, though she didn't know what Adam did to bring down Reinz's wrath, but her heart was actively beating.</p><br><br><p>With a squeak, two doors opened simultaneously.</p><br><p>Reinz and Chloe came into the kitchen, their eyes met but they quickly turned away shyly looking at each other.</p><br><p>Then, they noticed something strange.</p><br><p>There was no one else in the kitchen but them.</p><br><br><p>"Ah...?" Chloe's eyes went wide looking at the table.</p><br><p>Unlike yesterday, the table wasn't filled with various dishes, it consisted of two appetizers, one fish and one meat dish as well as dessert.</p><br><p>A red tablecloth covered the wooden table. Two chairs were arranged opposite each other in anticipation of the guests. Each of the two plates had a glass, a bottle of wine standing serenely in the middle waiting for the two important guests.</p><br><p>A thin trickle of smoke came from a tall candle burning at the edge of the table, leaving Reinz and Chloe no guesses except one.</p><br><p>Disbelief was reflected on Reinz's face.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, they both realized that this was a romantic dinner - just for the two of them.</p><br><p>Chloe didn't know how to react to that.</p><br><p>Well, Reinz was in the same situation, but someone needed to take control of the situation.</p><br><p>In a confident stride, Reinz approached Chloe as he gently took her hand like a princess.</p><br><p>"Chloe... Today was a rough day, I'd love to tell you everything and discuss what happened to me today. Hah..." a nervous laugh escaped his lips, "It was quite a sight. I hurt Adam pretty badly, I hope he's not mad at me."</p><br><p>Then, he turned around pointing to the table, to the slowly burning candle and the particles of flame reflecting in the dark glass of the bottle.</p><br><p>"Let's take advantage of this pleasant surprise. Let's not let their efforts go to waste, right?"</p><br><p>Suddenly, Chloe hugged him tightly, rubbing softly against his chest.</p><br><p>"Sure... Just you and me... It's going to be a lovely evening."</p>
