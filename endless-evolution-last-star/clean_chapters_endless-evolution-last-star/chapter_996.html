            <br><p>Out of the entire Light Legion, Kreyna held a solid second position in terms of strength. If she hadn't appeared here through the black flash along with Arnoth, no one would have dared to challenge her authority and her power.</p><br><p>She was terrifying in her anger, wanting to destroy anyone who dared to go against her.</p><br><p>Unlike someone like Adam and Arnoth, who thirsted for a decent fight, seeing it as an opportunity to become better and move further along the path of evolution, Kreyna had a different attitude.</p><br><p>She simply loved to humiliate the weak ones, show her superiority, and genuinely enjoy the suffering of her enemies.</p><br><br><p>Kreyna stepped out of the dust cloud, her aura growing stronger with every step.</p><br><p>She decided to start the fight the way any monster or Phantom who thought his enemy was much weaker would do - crush the opponent with the sheer power of her aura.</p><br><p>Could that work against Vorx and Risha?</p><br><p>Sure, it all depended on how strong their auras were.</p><br><p>"Shit, this is exactly what I expected!" Vorx exclaimed, releasing his aura.</p><br><p>The flaming serpent soared above him, trying to scare away the insidious demon with its fire. However, it was clearly not enough.</p><br><p>Kreyna smirked as she watched her aura gradually overwhelm Vorx's Spirit.</p><br><p>The only thing that could help him was Risha's aura, and she was well aware of that.</p><br><p>'Alright, two against one?' Risha muttered internally. 'When I rip that smirk off her face, I can defeat her single-handedly!'</p><br><p>With a fiery exclamation, Risha's aura grew into an aggressive, massive bear, growling belligerently at the cunning demon.</p><br><p>Flames and beast rage combined their efforts to knock Kreyna's demon back. Its smirk disappeared, replaced by pure displeasure.</p><br><p>"Tsk looks like you're a little better than bugs..." Kreyna hissed, guiding her hands to her belt.</p><br><p>Two long blades with dark blades found themselves in her tight grip.</p><br><p>Of all the Light Legion, she was the only one who used such a light and deadly weapon. She was not a soldier, a knight, much less a guard carrying a huge hammer.</p><br><p>The most appropriate description for her was an assassin.</p><br><p>Kreyna was fast, agile, and brutal. If an opponent was equal to her in strength, it wouldn't take her long to sink her blades into his neck and end the fight with a clean, bloody victory.</p><br><p>At the same time, Risha narrowed her eyes, wanting to know more about Kreyna.</p><br><p>'What do you think, Glen? Is she a Crown Type monster?</p><br><p>After a second, the young man's calm voice echoed in her mind.</p><br><p>'Sure. The government would definitely identify her as that type, what at the Lower Ring, what at the Upper Ring.'</p><br><br><p>'Given what we know about Kreyna, I thought she might turn out to be a Conqueror Type monster or even an Overlord Type, but that's not the case. The first floor of the castle is vast, but there's no one from the Light Legion here.'</p><br><p>Risha looked around. Glen was right.</p><br><p>For hundreds of meters, there were only columns and smooth marble reflecting the bright light of golden crystals.</p><br><p>If Kreyna wanted to, she could have placed at least a hundred knights here. That would help her win, especially if she were an Overlord or Conqueror monster.</p><br><p>"Well..." Kreyna slammed her blades against each other, causing sparks to fly. "Let's see what you can do. And... Vorx."</p><br><p>"Hah, what do you want, old witch?" Vorx smirked, there was no fear in his eyes. He knew what to expect heading into a fight against Kreyna.</p><br><p>Kreyna lifted her chin, looking at him with disdain.</p><br><p>"Mark my words. I will make your death slow and agonizing. Instead of completing the task given to you by Arnoth, you choose to enlist the help of the Phantoms?"</p><br><p>She stepped forward, her shadow trembling, revealing the dense darkness that wanted to touch her feet, but it was too soon.</p><br><p>"You, Heret, and all the members of the resistance are a true disgrace to every monster! From the soulless hound to...!"</p><br><p>Suddenly, Kreyna fell silent. She realized at the right moment that she might have said something she shouldn't.</p><br><p>"Right, that's not important right now. I just want you to know, teaming up with Phantoms is not how monsters should behave." Kreyna narrowed her eyes.</p><br><p>Vorx shrugged, flames covering his arms as he assumed a fighting stance. He would be ready for any trick Kreyna would pull.</p><br><p>"Well, when your people are captured and oppressed, you have no choice but to seek whatever help is available."</p><br><p>Then, he leaned in, condensing the flames in his right palm.</p><br><p>"It doesn't matter who, Phantoms, artifacts, or even other monsters that have nothing to do with our current mess. Me, Heret, and the rest are willing to do anything to regain our home and avenge the queen and king!"</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a fiery, scalding beam was launched into Kreyna's side. The tunnel of fire moved straight toward her, melting the marble beneath it, turning it into bubbling magma.</p><br><p>Kreyna frowned as he stepped forward, maintaining a fighting stance.</p><br><p>The purple darkness covered her blade, dense and intimidating.</p><br><p>In one sharp movement, she executed a vertical sweep, cleaving the beam in two.</p><br><p>Losing its structure, the fire lost its power, scattering to the left and right of Kreyna.</p><br><p>For some weak monster, this fire could be scalding, but Kreyna's armor didn't even heat up.</p><br><p>Vorx would have to put in a lot more effort if he wanted to do any real damage to Kreyna.</p><br><p>"Pffft, is that the best you can do? Pathetic."</p><br><p>But... for some reason, Vorx wasn't disappointed with his attack. He did what he had to do because it was just part of their plan.</p><br><p>"What?" Her eyes twitched to the side, seeing a shadow behind the stream of fire.</p><br><p>Kreyna realized it too late.</p><br><br><p>A wide blade passed through the clots of flame as the massive axe slammed straight into her side. Part of the sturdy armor cracked, shards flying in front of Risha's focused face.</p><br><p>"Don't forget bitch, there's two of us and you're alone. You're in a lose-lose position from the start!" Risha exclaimed, tossing Kreyna aside like a puppet.</p><br><p>Risha sighed heavily, as a slight smile appeared on her face, happy for their first step towards victory.</p><br><p>They had to know they only made the sleeping demon angrier.</p>
