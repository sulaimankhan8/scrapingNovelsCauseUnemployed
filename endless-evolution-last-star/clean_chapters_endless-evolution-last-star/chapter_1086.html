            <br><p>Chapter 1086: Nature of the Lords (Part 2)<br>
Serra was the first to set off with her partners at the Soaring Chain Islands. She, Kenex, and Horon were the only ones who could make it with minimal delay.</p><br><p>It was a difficult ordeal for them, though they knew that all they had to do was buy some time for reinforcements to arrive.</p><br><p>The pain from the torn wings would remind Serra of herself for a long time to come. Sure, it was her weapon, but when it was activated, the Arc became a part of her, much more than some sword – just a piece of iron.</p><br><p>But despite the bloody wounds on her back, a slight smile slowly appeared on her face. She was sure that after the arrival of a dozen Lords, victory was definitely on their side.</p><br><p>Even Kenward and Wilfred’s interference didn’t hinder her optimism since she knew that the Lords had a way to kill Saegar.</p><br><p>But… instead of Saegar’s death, soon all she saw was amber thunder descending towards her from the heavens.</p><br><p>Man and woman, the two Ascended Lords, fled the island as fast as they could.</p><br><p>With the next breath, Serra’s frame shuddered, turning to ash along with the floating island and heavy chains.</p><br><br><p>The two Lords screamed in pain. The woman lost her left arm, and the man lost one leg, and gruesome burns covered his ragged back. Even his armor could not protect him.</p><br><p>However, such wounds were not serious enough for the two Ascended Lords to die. Especially considering that one of them possessed a healing ability.</p><br><p>Unfortunately for them, Saegar had no intention of letting them go.</p><br><p>“For every flower…” he wheezed. “For every ray of sunshine that I’ve lost… You’ll have to answer for it.”</p><br><br><p>With a sweep of his arm, he hurled his spear in their direction. Before the Lords could even blink when the spear plunged into the man’s chest.</p><br><br><p>A new flash illuminated the Soaring Chain Islands.</p><br><p>The amber thunder blast tore the two Ascended Lords apart, leaving them nothing but space with raging wind currents.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Energy ran through Saegar’s arm as he created a new spear.</p><br><p>The Lord’s eyes went wide, filling with disbelief.</p><br><p>“WHAT?! He created a new one so easily…?!” one of them exclaimed in panic.</p><br><p>Saegar’s eyes darted towards him.</p><br><br><p>With a shudder, Saegar’s frame turned into a shadow, finding himself right in front of the Lord. Before the Lord could respond, Saegar swung his spears, slicing the man in an X-shape into four equal pieces.</p><br><p>Then, one thing became obvious to everyone – they could not defeat Saegar. Not after their trump card failed and they couldn’t hurt him badly.</p><br><p>“No, that can’t be!” One of the two Ascended Lords gulped, and a chill ran down his back. “Why is there such a gap between us!!!?”</p><br><p>Saegar appeared in front of him.</p><br><p>His amber eyes were devoid of interest. Only coldness and a deep, ancient darkness lurked.</p><br><p>“Because you think that if weak monsters, some trash addresses you as Lords, then you are equal to those like me.”</p><br><br><p>Saegar grabbed the man by the throat when two red dragon eyes opened on his gauntlet.</p><br><p>“It isn’t. You cannot fight against the True Lords, but you forget that every time. Especially when you think any of us are the enemy and traitors to all monsters. You got the power, but you remain as foolish as you were.”</p><br><p>Five electric shocks traveled through Saegar’s Arc, blasting multiple gaping holes in the man. Blood rushed outward, pouring over the gray, ruined ground where a field of flowers had recently been.</p><br><p>That was the last straw.</p><br><p>“Fuck! Run!” The Lords exclaimed, scattering to the sides.</p><br><p>Everyone was trying to find the fastest way to get out of the Soaring Chain Islands, from the lands that turned into a bloody hell in an instant.</p><br><p>Some of the Lords tried to activate artifacts, something similar to what Rosana used in her escape from Adam, but it was a critical mistake.</p><br><p>Slash. Slash. Slash.</p><br><p>Like a ghost, Saegar appeared beside the Lords. He cut them down one by one.</p><br><p>If one managed to escape far enough, there was nothing to stop him from throwing a spear or calling down a thunderbolt.</p><br><p>Right now, he was the true ruler of these lands. Everything within a radius of hundreds of meters was under his control, and only he decided who lived and who didn’t.</p><br><p>Adam watched the massacre with a mesmerized gaze, a combination of desperation and cruelty as well as strength and nobility.</p><br><p>After Saegar showed his wing, the Lords before him lost all their majesty. Now, it was like a knight slaying vile rogues while cleansing his home of their plague.</p><br><p>There was nothing new to Wilfred and Kenward in this scene, but they were in no hurry to leave.</p><br><p>“Well, well, it’s not every day you see a True Lord kill a dozen other Lords.”</p><br><br><p>Wilfred patted Adam on the shoulder.</p><br><p>“This is the Dark Shore, kid, and we’re not even in the center of it. On the far side, where the lands of the Befallen Crown lie, bigger things often happen.”</p><br><p>“But…” Adam’s voice quavered. “Aren’t the Lords supposed to be the pinnacle of evolution? If Citadel were to lose ten Second Rank Phantoms, it would be a disaster! A threat to all of humanity!”</p><br><p>“They are.” Wilfred nodded. “First of all, don’t compare a Phantom like me and some Baron, the weakest of the Lesser Lords, and secondly…”</p><br><p>He shook off the ash as he looked around at the trembling monsters in the distance. He could see every one of them.</p><br><p>“It’s simple math, Adam. It’s easier to become a Lord than a Second Rank Phantom, and there are far more monsters than people. There aren’t even a hundred million of us, while there are billions of monsters, probably tens of billions by now, though… soon those numbers won’t matter anymore.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam turned around.</p><br><p>“Mr. Wilfred, how did you find me? How did you know I was here?”</p><br><p>Wilfred guided the cigarette to his mouth.</p><br><p>“Adam. I knew your exact location from the first second you were at the Lower Ring.”</p><br><p>“Finding you was easy.”</p>
