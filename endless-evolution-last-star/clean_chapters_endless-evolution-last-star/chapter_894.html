            <br><br><p>The clap echoed around the arena as a delighted Erik rose from his seat.</p><br><p>"We have a winner! My beautiful wife Julia!" Erik exclaimed waving his hand in her direction, "Go! Audience, where's your applause?"</p><br><p>Silvana and Chloe looked over at each other. Other than Erik they were the only spectators, the only ones who could support his cheers.</p><br><p>Seeing nothing wrong with that, Silvana shrugged and began to clap her hands slowly.</p><br><p>Chloe gulped, 'That's... Damn! I don't want to clap when Reinz loses!'</p><br><p>However, she eventually got up too.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Erik nodded deeply and found himself next to Julia.</p><br><p>"What do you think? Did they do well?" Erik glanced at the two young men, they were lying on the ground, unconscious.</p><br><br><p>The two crystal tails disappeared into the bloody armor, Julia nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yeah... I think they deserve praise..." Julia pointed down, "Especially one of them."</p><br><p>Erik looked down, his pupils dilated for a moment.</p><br><p>In a tight grip, Adam's hand held onto Julia's right foot. Not that it would help him achieve victory, but... Reinz didn't even have time to recover let alone try to attack.</p><br><p>"Not bad, not bad at all." Erik was satisfied as he swung his arm.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Julia's bloody armor shattered into shards, returning her to normal.</p><br><p>"I'll get these two fixed up, go with the girls to make lunch. We're all in for a long talk."</p><br><p>Without a doubt in her gaze, Julia nodded, "Sure. I don't know about that Alderran Family guy, but... Adam can open the second lesser gates. I'm positive of it."</p><br><p>Then, Julia dashed over next to Erik, with a wave of her hand she beckoned to Silvana and Chloe, who hurried down to the entrance.</p><br><p>They wanted to know how Julia did it. What kind of power it was and if they would ever be able to obtain something like it.</p><br><p>However, Julia was not going to answer their questions.</p><br><p>She had the task of making dinner, and all she was going to do was get Silvana and Chloe to help her.</p><br><p>If Erik thought it was necessary, he would tell everything himself, there was no other way.</p><br><p>Silvana and Chloe weren't worried about anything happening to Adam and Reinz. After all, each of them had suffered more serious wounds, and Erik had to help them.</p><br><p>Soon, the sounds of footsteps faded like torches, leaving Erik alone with the two young men.</p><br><p>"Well, well..." Erik shook his head, pulling a regular folding knife out of his pocket, "I gave them one week, right? Hah, it looks like I was wrong this time. They'll get through this much faster. With their control, figuring out how to open the second gates will be a lot easier than for the majority."</p><br><p>With a slight movement, Erik swung the knife, leaving a long cut on his palm.</p><br><p>However, the blood was slow to flow out, as if waiting for permission.</p><br><p>First, Erik approached Reinz, he leaned slightly and guided his hand to Reinz's mouth.</p><br><br><p>A single crimson drop flew from Erik's palm, ending up on Reinz's lips, slowly moving to his tongue.</p><br><p>Then, Erik did the same for Adam, but...</p><br><br><p>This time there were two drops.</p><br><p>Energy could make Phantoms stronger, just like it worked with monsters, but unlike monsters, it was only for a short period. For monsters, energy was a resource for evolution, while for humans it could be an enhancement for combat.</p><br><p>Most often energy was found in the valuable objects that filled the Dead Lands and especially the Wild Lands, the most common and usual option was crystals.</p><br><p>But, if a creature was powerful enough, a single drop of blood could contain more energy than dozens of crystals.</p><br><p>Obviously, Erik fits that description.</p><br><p>A drop of his blood was a treasure, but not without its drawbacks. It was a blessing and a curse at the same time.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Adam and Reinz's faces twisted in searing pain. They forcibly regained consciousness, their eyes wide open in agony.</p><br><p>If Erik's drop of blood had gotten into the mouth of an ordinary person, that person would inevitably die without urgent help. The excess energy would simply tear the man apart.</p><br><p>Well, the same thing would happen to a weak monster. They were adapted to absorb energy much better than humans, but each had its limits.</p><br><br><p>Adam stretched out his hand, his trembling fingers clutching at the sand in a desperate attempt to keep the pain away.</p><br><p>It seemed to him as if a fire had started inside, and soon he would be burned and there wouldn't be even a handful of ashes left.</p><br><br><p>Erik snapped his fingers.</p><br><p>Simultaneously, three drops of his blood that still remained intact exploded, releasing all the energy.</p><br><p>'Unfortunately, energy alone isn't enough to heal wounds.' Erik pondered, changing the property of his energy as it spread through their bodies, 'But, given the difference in our strength, it will be enough for me to get only a small healing effect to match the capabilities of the K4-Phantom.'</p><br><p>In an instant, Adam and Reinz froze.</p><br><p>Instead of pain, only relief came over them like a refreshing wave crashing down time after time.</p><br><p>Then, their wounds quickly began to heal.</p><br><p>Julia made only a few attacks, but she didn't hold back her strength. It was enough to make Adam and Reinz pass out, the wounds were deep.</p><br><br><p>Adam took a deep breath, sucking in fresh air like it was his first breath in a year.</p><br><p>"Fuck! What was that?!"</p><br><p>Reinz in turn breathed slowly, trying to recover from the beating.</p><br><p>A bitter smile appeared on his face, "Hah... It's only been two days and... I got beaten a second time."</p><br><p>Then, he glanced at Erik, "Before the fight started, I was wondering where our wounds disappeared to? Adam and I... beat each other up pretty badly. Moreover, I was sure that after Adam's final attack, I was able to keep myself awake, but I was still knocked out. Now... I get it..."</p><br><p>In response, Erik shrugged, tapped his cane on the ground, and turned around.</p><br><p>"I couldn't make you fight wounded, so I had to heal you." Erik's carefree voice echoed, "Get up, it's time for you to learn about the proper use of energy, not the shame I witnessed earlier."</p><br><p>Confusion covered Adam and Reinz's faces.</p><br><p>Erik looked at them over his shoulder.</p><br><p>"You think you know how to use Energy Control? Hah, that's just a tiny part of it," he headed forward, "Get up, lunch will be ready soon."</p>
