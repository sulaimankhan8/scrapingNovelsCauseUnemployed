            <br><p>The Sacrificial Waterfalls could be seen in the distance, surrounded on one side by the Sorrowful Dew Expanse and on the other by the Soaring Chain Islands.</p><br><p>Among the monsters roaming the dark lands, a black flash stood out, rapidly approaching from afar.</p><br><p>Soon, Gladius saw the first bright dots in the distance as a satisfied smile appeared on his face. He knew what it was - the dew trees, which meant he was close.</p><br><p>The smell of thick blood occasionally teased his nose from the distant waterfalls, and even the wind currents coming from the chain islands reached his frame.</p><br><p>Despite his haste, Gladius slowed down slightly.</p><br><p>He wasn't worried about being attacked, even here, there were no monsters that could harm him.</p><br><p>Well, except for one he was aware of.</p><br><p>Gladius reduced his speed so as not to accidentally destroy a dew tree. If that happened, even he would be in trouble. After all, those trees were protected by one of the True Lords, a follower of the Free End.</p><br><br><p>Gladius stopped abruptly, raising a cloud of dust.</p><br><p>He turned his gaze upward to face a man hovering above the ground, riding a great dark horse.</p><br><br><p>Kenward lowered himself to the ground, meeting Gladius's gaze.</p><br><p>"What are you doing here? Did you really come here on foot...?" Kenward muttered.</p><br><p>He was baffled. There was no way he could expect Gladius's arrival at a time like this. There was simply no reason for it.</p><br><p>Kenward glanced at the Soaring Chain Islands.</p><br><br><p>"Hahahahahaha! Did you run here to help the young Phantom? Didn't you?"</p><br><p>Gladius didn't answer anything. He didn't understand how Kenward knew about it and... Why was Kenward laughing?</p><br><p>This was a rare event at the Dark Shore.</p><br><p>"Damn, today is actually a spectacular day. All thanks to Adam. Hahaha, I can't believe you came just now, Gladius."</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Gladius's face went pale. "What are you talking about? Adam? How do you know his name?"</p><br><br><p>Kenward approached Gladius, stopping his regretful gaze on him.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry, Gladius, but Adam Vinter has already left the Dark Shore. He found the Twilight Crystal, and the black flash brought him back to your lands. If you came here for him, you can turn around."</p><br><p>Gladius clutched his head, his fingers sinking into his hair while his eyes twitched in panic.</p><br><p>Somewhere far away, a devious smirk showed on Xyrea's face. She knew what would happen if Gladius arrived at the Soaring Chain Islands in time. There was no interest in that for her.</p><br><p>But, what would Gladius do now?</p><br><p>Even she didn't know that.</p><br><p>"FUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!! This can't be fucking happening! I was running at full speed! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!" Gladius's roar erupted across the dark lands, scaring away the monsters peeking out from the bones.</p><br><br><p>Gladius's fist plunged into the ground, sending shivers dozens of meters and creating a deep crater.</p><br><p>"Judging by your reaction, that was the only reason why you came to the Dark Shore today, right?" Kenward asked.</p><br><p>Gladius raised his head.</p><br><p>"Of course! This kind of thing rarely happens! What's more, I think you should realize that Adam's a pretty interesting kid."</p><br><p>Kenward smirked. "Well, you can't argue with that. You've got the First Star to thank for that, but without Adam and the path he's traveled, he wouldn't be here. It was good entertainment."</p><br><p>"Shit! Why the fuck are you telling me this?!" Gladius clenched his fists in anger. "You want to make me feel even worse that I missed all the fun?"</p><br><p>Kenward waved his hand, heading onward.</p><br><p>"You're right, it's none of my business. You can stay here if you want. Just don't touch the dew trees or even I'll get mad."</p><br><p>Then, Gladius's pupils narrowed as Xyrea shared with him new information.</p><br><p>"Hey! Kenward, did Adam tell you how he ended up at the Dark Shore?!"</p><br><p>Kenward touched his chin, thoughtfully. "Yeah, I remember something like that. It all happened because of a girl, a regenerative monster from the Sacrificial Waterfalls. They were watching the battle the whole time, but they were too weak to take part."</p><br><p>That was enough for Gladius as he directed his hungry and cruel gaze straight towards the distant waterfalls.</p><br><p>"The Sacrificial Waterfalls means, right? You won't be mad if I visit them, will you?"</p><br><p>Kenward continued his stride.</p><br><p>"As I said, the main thing is don't touch the trees, though, unlike young Adam, you've known that rule for a long time."</p><br><p>Gladius licked his lips predatorily as his frame shuddered, turning into a dark flash.</p><br><p>He had no reason to antagonize Kenward, even for him, it would be a problem, but the monsters at the Sacrificial Waterfalls were on a whole other level.</p><br><p>Moreover, he had a reason to attack them, because one of their monsters tried to kill Adam and almost succeeded.</p><br><p>Gladius approached the main waterfall, climbing up the jutting rocks in a few leaps.</p><br><p>Kenward, watching from afar, shook his head.</p><br><p>"I just figured out how they operate, and soon I'll have to get used to my new neighbors. Maybe it's for the best though. There's no reason to do business with these fools."</p><br><br><p>At the same time, in the middle of the bloody river, appeared Gladius, who was walking on the water towards a group of baffled regenerative monsters led by Ivar and Osmer. Rosana stood aside with the others.</p><br><p>They saw what happened at the Soaring Chain Islands and were about to contact the leadership of the Befallen Crown, but an unknown intruder distracted them.</p><br><p>Unlike Kenward, who immediately recognized who Gladius was, for the regenerative monsters, he was an unknown Phantom who somehow ended up in the middle of their lair.</p><br><br><p>She and the others hadn't yet realized how big a threat Gladius was because he was hiding his aura.</p><br><br><p>Gladius shook his head, pulling out white gloves and slowly slipping them over his hands.</p><br><p>"You're out of luck since I'm in a shitty mood."</p><br><p>A sadistic glint ran across his eyes.</p><br><p>"Just fight back a little. It'll be much more interesting that way!"</p>
