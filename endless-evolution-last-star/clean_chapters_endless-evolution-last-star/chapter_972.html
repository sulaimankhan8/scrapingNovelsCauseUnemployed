            <br><p>Risha stood to the side, watching the bright flames with Adam at its core. His energy had peaked a few minutes ago, covering most of the dark field and absorbing countless streams of energy.</p><br><p>From time to time, bits of flame flew away randomly. It was stray energ,y and it was dangerous since the particles could pass through the walls and end up in the castle grounds.</p><br><p>Even if they were just random flecks, it could be enough for Arnoth or Kreyna to notice a strange, powerful aura not belonging to the monsters. This would arouse suspicion, and soon the secret serpent hideout would be found.</p><br><p>However, that was not destined to happen.</p><br><p>Any energy, every particle or stream that randomly went outside of the dark field was immediately absorbed by complete mirrors, glass fragments, or even red pillars as a last defense measure.</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage didn't just let the strongest serpents from the resistance train here. He knew he could hide their energy no matter what was going on at the Magma Plateau or how strong the fighters were.</p><br><p>Not wanting to get behind Adam, Risha turned to Grita and Torz. They were watching with slight smiles as she did.</p><br><p>"What should I do...? Vorx said I could help him defeat Kreyna!" she stammered, uncertainty gripping her once again.</p><br><p>"Tsk," Torz snorted. "Only if you get strong enough. Your aura isn't as powerful as Adam's."</p><br><p>Grita punched him lightly in the shoulder, heading toward Risha with a smooth gait.</p><br><p>"Come on, Torz, do you have to always be so mean? But, Rish, he's right about something."</p><br><br><p>Grita glanced over his shoulder at the seemingly sleeping Adam, but his aura only grew stronger.</p><br><p>"Adam is actually on another level. I realize that, technically, you're on the same stage, you've both opened the third lesser gates, but... You can't beat him."</p><br><p>Before Risha could respond, Grita gently took her hand, guiding her to the dark field.</p><br><p>"Here. No one is stopping you from just going ahead and lying down next to Heret and Adam," then her eyes went wide for a moment. "Oh, I had a great idea. How about we walk this path together? Well, as far as we can."</p><br><p>Risha looked puzzled. She didn't understand what Grita meant at the end of her speech.</p><br><p>'Wait... Can't we reach the center just like Adam and Heret?'</p><br><p>Without further ado, they held hands and took the first step.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Risha's body, goosebumps coming in waves as her vision was covered in dense darkness for a moment. Instead of Adam and Heret's silhouettes in the center, she saw only their figures hidden by shadows.</p><br><p>Stunned by the pressure, Risha turned around, wanting to see what state Grita was in.</p><br><br><p>One step was enough to remove the slight smile from her face and become more serious.</p><br><p>"Go ahead, we can't stop after only one step. We have to take three, for the first time it will be enough..." she gulped leading Risha behind her.</p><br><br><p>On the second step, they simultaneously collapsed to one knee, but through clenched teeth, they managed to get up.</p><br><p>'What the hell...?' Risha growled inwardly out of helplessness and deep terror. 'Adam and Heret walked forward as if they were carrying very heavy sacks, but I feel like I'm being pushed by a whole mountain!'</p><br><p>Gaining strength, Grita and Risha walked a little further, but halfway to the center, they reached their maximum.</p><br><p>With a thud they collapsed to the ground, the pressure pressing their faces to the surface, they found it hard to even twitch their fingertips.</p><br><p>Sure, gradually, they would get used to it and be able to get back up or even get down on one knee.</p><br><p>But, to walk further to reach the center?</p><br><p>That seemed like an impossible task.</p><br><p>"No... It can't be..." Risha wheezed with difficulty raising her head.</p><br><p>Then, she gasped in disbelief.</p><br><p>Adam opened his eyes, staring at her with his calm gaze. His right hand nestled on his raised knee, and his shoulders were relaxed though they should be stronger than steel under such pressure.</p><br><p>"Is that all...?" his quiet voice boomed out, reaching Risha's ears. "When Vorx spoke about the battle against Kreyna... I saw the fire in your eyes. Has that flame already faded away? So quickly?"</p><br><p>Risha gulped. "But... I don't understand how you did it, my bones, I think they're going to break now."</p><br><p>"And?" Adam tilted his head. "Is that a problem?"</p><br><br><p>"I'm sure the serpents have a way to heal your wounds. You are a resident of the Lower Ring. Are you afraid of getting a few wounds in return for your strength?"</p><br><p>No more words were needed.</p><br><p>What was at stake was her pride as a Phantom, as a resident of the Lower Ring, and as Orel's little sister.</p><br><p>After all, being weak and helpless was her worst nightmare.</p><br><br><p>Risha stepped forward, then another, and another. She felt as if her heart would explode, that her eyes would cease to see, and her bones would break, starting with her whitened fingers.</p><br><p>However... she took another step, vastly overtaking Grita and finding herself in great proximity to Adam.</p><br><br><p>Unable to finish, Risha's eyes went blank as she crumbled to the ground.</p><br><p>Adam smiled, watching her heavy but measured breathing.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, she hadn't sustained any wounds. It was all an illusion, at least on the physical side.</p><br><p>"Hah, there's a reason I saw something similar in her when we first met," Adam said, shaking his head. "That pressure acts on your energy like the aura of a dangerous enemy rather than a steel hammer breaking your bones."</p><br><p>Heret's eyes went wide for a moment.</p><br><p>"Guy... When did you figure that out?"</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head. "As soon as I walked in here. A few times, I've had to experience pain coming from the inside instead of the outside. So, it helped me."</p><br><p>Then, he raised his head, looking at the star-crystal through the layer of mist mixed into his energy.</p><br><p>"Now, I've proven to you that she can be worthy, haven't I, Radiant Mirage?"</p>
