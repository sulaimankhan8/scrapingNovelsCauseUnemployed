            <br><br><p>The shard split the wind currents with its sharp tip aiming for Adam's neck.</p><br><p>Feeling threatened and seeing Tron's movements, Adam took a step back, the shard flying right in front of his focused eyes.</p><br><p>Reaching the ground, the shard plunged into the semi-transparent veil covering the floor, also part of the Tron's dome.</p><br><p>The veil rippled like the surface of water when a stone fell into a lake, and the shard disappeared as if it had never been there.</p><br><p>"Hah, you dropped dozens of shards on me last time. Decided to take pity on me this time?" Adam smirked, remaining attentive and focused.</p><br><br><p>"That's what you wanted to do yourself. I can understand your interest, but I think it's pretty weird to ask to be in a situation where you can't win."</p><br><p>Adam smirked as a long needle appeared in his hand.</p><br><p>"That's a cool ability, I can already tell that. It's probably very easy to win one-on-one fights with this ability, isn't it?"</p><br><p>Adam quickly looked around.</p><br><p>He realized that Tron could summon glass blades from any part of the dome, allowing him to create the illusion that his opponent was fighting against an entire squad.</p><br><p>Then, Adam looked at Tron intently.</p><br><p>"Hey, do you want to tell me how to get out of here? How can your opponent defeat you when you use this ability?"</p><br><p>Tron smiled bitterly, Adam had never seen such a reaction from him before.</p><br><p>"How ironic to hear that from you."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion, "What do you mean?" Experience more on empire</p><br><p>Tron spread his hands.</p><br><p>"If you and I were at the same power level, my ability would be useless against you. I mean, specifically against you."</p><br><p>Tron pointed at Adam's needle.</p><br><p>"You'd be able to just cut through the dome with your needle. Another Phantom who would be equal to me in strength wouldn't manage to do that, so in a way, you're the one who's an inconvenient opponent for me." Tron said calmly. It wasn't a problem for him to admit his shortcomings or the advantages of others.</p><br><p>Adam got an awkward smile. He regarded Tron's words as praise, which was simultaneously true and not.</p><br><p>"However..." Tron continued, "Right now you're much weaker than me, even considering I've lowered my power from K3 to K2."</p><br><p>"But, what if your opponent has no abilities capable of breaking through the dome? How do they defeat you then?"</p><br><br><p>"Well, then things get a lot more complicated and primitive. My opponent has to either kill me, exhaust me, or wait for the dome to run out of energy, and my opponent can escape if he has the right abilities to do so."</p><br><p>With a long sigh, Tron shook his head:</p><br><p>"All in all, there are always plenty of options. In the end, this isn't a strict puzzle where there can only be one answer, it's a battle."</p><br><p>Tron raised his head, his amethyst eyes directed a hard, deep gaze at Adam.</p><br><p>"Eventually, right turns out to be the one who wins. The loser's opinions, thoughts, and plans have no meaning or value, for the dead do not speak."</p><br><p>Adam shuddered, a wave of coldness running down his back. Tron's words made sense but were dark and ominous in their essence.</p><br><p>At the same time, three pairs of eyes looked toward the glass dome.</p><br><p>Silvana was nervously biting her lip, Riska was wary as they both could see nothing but their reflections in the mirror.</p><br><p>Dahla's reflection was here as well, but unlike the two Operators, she could clearly see everything that was going on inside thanks to her Gene Field.</p><br><p>Sure, with her Gene Field, she couldn't see the color of Adam's hair or Tron's eyes, but their silhouettes, their bodies, their weapons, and abilities she saw perfectly.</p><br><p>When Tron created the dome, Dahla immediately activated her Gene Field, since both Tron and Adam were significantly weaker than Dahla, she could easily see everything.</p><br><p>If Tron was equal in power to Dahla or superior to her, he could make it so that she couldn't see him.</p><br><p>'Damn, what are they doing up there? I may be able to see everything, but this dome doesn't let sounds through. Are they talking about something? But what? Fuck, start fighting already, am I here for nothing?'</p><br><br><p>Tron sighed as he shrugged.</p><br><p>Then, he slowly raised his hand and turned his wrist.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, several glass blades rained down on Adam at once, they flew from different parts of the dome, surrounding him on all sides.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils narrowed as he quickly swung his needle several times, successfully shattering two blades.</p><br><p>'Alright, there's one more left!' Adam swung his needle in front of him, shattering the last, third blade.</p><br><br><p>Just as he raised his arm, finishing the last swing, two more blades flew into his chest, which Tron had launched at him just a second ago.</p><br><p>'Fuck! That was too fast! I just had time to destroy the past blades before the new ones hit me!' Adam inwardly exclaimed, lowering his eyes to his chest.</p><br><p>These glass shards were different from the ones that had fallen off Tron's sword. They were much longer, thicker, and sharper, like daggers, but two such blades were not enough to penetrate Adam's ribcage.</p><br><br><p>Adam ripped the blades from his chest and tossed them aside, gritting his teeth against the bright, unpleasant pain.</p><br><p>"I told you this was too much for you. I think it would be best if I cancel my ability." Tron said as the energy traveled through his body.</p><br><p>"No. Stop!" Adam shouted out thrusting his arm forward, "Attacking at full power. I'm sure I can last a full minute!"</p><br><p>Tron's eyes went wide for a moment.</p><br><p>"One minute? Adam, you're delusional. It's impossible for you."</p><br><p>Adam smirked confidently as electric shocks went all over his body and a lightning horn appeared on the right side of his head.</p><br><p>"In that case, how about a bet? What will you do if I can survive in this glass cage for one minute being under a barrage of attacks?"</p><br><p>Tron took some time to think before seriously answering: "Well... I wasn't prepared for something like that, so I don't know what to suggest to you. I only have one idea that might suit you."</p><br><p>"Tell me what it is." Adam immediately uttered.</p><br><p>Tron pointed over his shoulder to the stone slab in the wall from where he pulled Adam's Nexus earlier.</p><br><p>"If you do that before the end of our training in the Gray Castle, I'll show you my Nexus."</p>
