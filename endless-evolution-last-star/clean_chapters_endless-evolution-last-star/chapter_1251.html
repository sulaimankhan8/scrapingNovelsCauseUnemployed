            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1251: Four Fighters and Four Crystals (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Monsters, like humans, were different, very different, and the Dark Blobs were one of the best examples of this.</p><br><p>They were both one monster and several monsters at the same time, depending on what form they wanted to take at any given moment.</p><br><p>This also allowed them to effectively adapt to the situation on the battlefield, as was the case with the first guard.</p><br><p>Instead of attacking him all at once, the Dark Blobs bet on one powerful, destructive strike.</p><br><p>If it hadn’t been a bloom guard, they could have already celebrated their victory, but the Red Bloom was not going to stand for it.</p><br><p>“Little bastards… They think they can just come and kill my guards?! I won’t let that happen!”</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A tremor ran across the surface as several dark roots burst out of the ground. They quickly connected the two parts of the bloom guard and, with an energy pulse, returned his body to its previous state.</p><br><br><p>The first guard’s feet touched the surface, as it was ready to continue fighting against the Dark Blobs.</p><br><br><p>“How did it survive?!”</p><br><p>“We killed it! We have to kill it again!”</p><br><p>At the same time, the Thorn Hunter was fighting against the second guard. His twin blades rained down on the second guard, cutting through its armor. But the second guard recovered as quickly as a Regenerative Monster.</p><br><p>This scene could not help but elicit a sly smirk from the Red Bloom.</p><br><p>‘Hahaha, weaklings! I don’t even need to leave the barrier to deal with you! At this rate, you’ll never make it to…!’</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p><br><p>At the same moment, there was a loud crack like broken glass. In a heartbeat, the smirk disappeared from the Red Bloom’s face, replaced first by shock and then panic as she realized what had happened.</p><br><br><p>Red fragments flew past Adam, who confidently held the grand needle in front of him. Dark and white streams of energy enveloped him as he walked down the path to destroy the crystal.</p><br><p>As Garrah had said, the barrier around the crystal was much weaker than the outer barrier. The Red Bloom had counted on the guards being enough to protect the crystals, and she would have been right if it weren’t for Adam.</p><br><br><p>Adam took a short step forward as he turned back. The Dark Blobs and the Thorn Hunter continued to fight, even though it no longer made sense.</p><br><p>Their task at this point was complete.</p><br><br><p>A bright flash lit up the forest with a red glow as the pulse ran along the main root, returning directly to the bud in the center of the forest.</p><br><p>The first crystal was destroyed, and Adam’s team had less than an hour to reach the rest. Otherwise, they would not make it in time, and their plan would fail.</p><br><p>“Let’s go, we don’t have time to waste,” Adam said dryly and rushed forward.</p><br><p>Without hesitation, the Dark Blobs transformed into swift beasts and followed him. Garrah and the Thorn Hunter exchanged glances and nodded to each other.</p><br><p>They didn’t show it, but everything had gone much better than they had expected.</p><br><p>Adam broke through the barrier on his first try, and there was no reason why he couldn’t do it again a few more times.</p><br><p>Moreover, they didn’t have to fight the bloom guards. Because of their connection to the roots, the bloom guards couldn’t pursue them anyway.</p><br><p>‘FUCK!’ The Red Bloom clenched her fists as her nails dug into her palms, leaving bloody streaks. ‘How did he do that?! I didn’t even have time to understand anything! Are his abilities designed to destroy barriers?!’</p><br><p>Sure, Adam was known among monsters, but not everyone knew about him. The Red Bloom didn’t know who Adam Vinter was, though she expected the same fate as all his other opponents.</p><br><p>‘I won’t have time to evolve! I need a few more weeks! Shit! Damn Phantoms, they always ruin everything. Why can’t they just stay in their Citadel and leave me alone?!’</p><br><p>The second and third crystals were destroyed as easily as the first.</p><br><p>The Red Bloom tried to delay Adam and the others, but her abilities were limited. She was spending too much energy on evolution, multiple layers of barriers, guards, and constant surveillance.</p><br><p>Moreover, it took their group only ten minutes. They had plenty of time to spare.</p><br><p>The only thing left for the Red Bloom to do was to try to delay them at the last crystal, and for that, she was ready to direct all her power to one point.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The energy running through the roots headed for the last crystal, filling the barrier with power. Soon, the barrier ceased to be transparent, but solid red, and the bloom guards received all the energy that the Red Bloom could give them.</p><br><p>Adam was confident that they would be able to destroy every crystal, but when he saw the four guards in the distance, he realized that it would not be as easy as it had been in the past.</p><br><p>“There are four of them now?”</p><br><p>Garrah nodded deeply. “That was to be expected. This is the last crystal, so now she can focus all her power on one point.”</p><br><p>“What are we going to do?” The Thorn Hunter asked. “If necessary, I can hold off two of them for a while, but I’m not sure how long I can last.”</p><br><p>In response, Garrah shook his head.</p><br><p>“Leave that task to me. You’ve done enough with the previous crystals.”</p><br><p>Then, he turned to Adam.</p><br><p>“Make sure you can destroy the reinforced crystal in one attack. This is crucial.”</p><br><p>Adam understood what Garrah was talking about. Basically, he was asking if Adam had something more powerful than the path.</p><br><p>“Don’t worry.” Adam smiled as he released his needle. “I have one tool specifically for this crystal.”</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Garrah stopped and slammed his palms onto the ground.</p><br><p>Massive dark roots engulfed in green flames burst out of the soil, heading toward the bloom guards.</p><br><p>The Dark Blobs expected Adam to run forward, but instead, he remained where he was.</p><br><br><p>“You don’t have much time!”</p><br><p>“You must destroy the crystal!”</p><br><p>Adam’s lips curved upward.</p><br><p>“I know, that’s exactly what I’m going to do!”</p><br><p>He stretched one arm forward as Silvana appeared to his left, forming the outline of a great pair of scissors that, along with the crystal, would certainly cut through half the forest.</p>
