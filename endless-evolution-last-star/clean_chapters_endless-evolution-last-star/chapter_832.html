            <br><p>It's unclear what Adam was expecting, perhaps some secret or a way to speed up the connection of the stars by many times.</p><br><p>Instead, he got something else.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Go to the center of the Citadel?" he tilted his head in confusion, "But, I've been in the First Ring many times, especially because of the nobles. I had to learn about the Wings and many other things."</p><br><p>However, Douglas shook his head with a sly grin, showing that Adam was heading in the wrong direction.</p><br><p>"No Adam, I'm not talking about the First Ring, there's nothing for you to do there, at least not until you want to get involved with the nobles again. Hahaha, I wouldn't advise you to do that. They're even more trouble than you are."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, with a slight frown.</p><br><p>'Did he praise me now or what?'</p><br><p>Then, Douglas waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Adam, while we're on the subject, tell me what you know about the Citadel."</p><br><p>Douglas's voice grew deeper:</p><br><p>"What parts does the Citadel consist of?"</p><br><p>In turn, Adam took a few seconds to think before nodding:</p><br><p>"That's easy, it is my home after all. There are the Three Rings, each has its size and features, but that's not what we're talking about right now. Then come the slums and just beyond them are the walls, the last border between humanity and the Dead Lands."</p><br><p>After that, his eyes went downward.</p><br><p>"I don't know much about this part of the Citadel. My journey down has been postponed for a long time. However, the Citadel is also divided into the Upper Ring and the Lower Ring."</p><br><p>Suddenly, Seyrina's voice rang out:</p><br><p>"How many parts are there in total?"</p><br><p>Adam did a quick count, nodded to himself, and looked at Douglas.</p><br><p>"Considering the slums, it comes out to six. Sure, the Three Rings are part of the Upper Ring, but only six regions have clear divisions."</p><br><br><p>Douglas nodded deeply, his face turning serious.</p><br><p>"However, you're wrong Adam. There's one place even people born in the First Ring can't go."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide, disbelief mixed with curiosity. He wanted to know the secrets of the Citadel, perhaps he shared that feeling with millions of the inhabitants, but not everyone had that opportunity.</p><br><p>"This place is at the very center of the Citadel, one of the names of this region - the Zero Ring."</p><br><p>"The Z-Zero Ring...?"</p><br><p>Adam gulped. No one had ever mentioned the Zero Ring before. That was enough for Adam to realize how important a secret it was.</p><br><p>If he didn't get so close to the K3-Level, neither Douglas nor anyone else would ever tell him about the Zero Ring.</p><br><p>The K2-Phantoms and the others had nothing to do there.</p><br><p>However, doubt quickly showed in his gaze. He was familiar with the First Ring and because of Osana's wedding, he had to visit many of its parts.</p><br><p>'No, is that possible?' Adam wondered, 'The very center of the First Ring has buildings like everywhere else, skyscrapers and more strict buildings, most likely the government is clustered there, yet...'</p><br><p>Adam's eyes grew deeper, going over all his memories from the First Ring.</p><br><p>'There's no room for another zone. Even if the Zero Ring is five times smaller than the First Ring, it's still impossible.'</p><br><br><p>Douglas clapped powerfully, drawing attention to himself.</p><br><p>"Alright, we have a lot of work ahead of us. We're going to the Zero Ring right now!"</p><br><br><br><p>Following Douglas, Adam, Silvana, and Seyrina left Fort Norton. However, they did not exit through the main entrance, but from the side of the technical area.</p><br><p>A car, without a driver, was waiting for them among the alleys where no one usually showed up.</p><br><p>Douglas turned to Seyrina.</p><br><p>'You know where to go, don't you?'</p><br><p>A slight smile formed on her face as she nodded.</p><br><p>"Sure, I remember well the day I first arrived at the Zero Ring. There won't be any problems with our access level, especially with yours..."</p><br><p>"Good to hear. Don't be afraid to go full throttle, no car or restrictions will stop you, you can be sure of that."</p><br><p>Soon they were in the car. Douglas took the seat next to the driver, Seyrina was ready to start the engine, and Silvana and Adam were in the back seats.</p><br><p>They felt strange, especially Silvana. She didn't show it in any way, but deep inside she was outraged to hear about the Zero Ring for the first time.</p><br><p>'The Zero Ring...' she thought to herself, 'What's in there if even after several access upgrades it's still a mystery to me?'</p><br><p>A shudder ran along the car, the vibrations of the powerful engine echoed in their bodies, this was not like the usual, stealthy military vehicles.</p><br><p>Then, with fire in her eyes, Seyrina gripped the steering wheel tightly and pushed the gas pedal to full.</p><br><br><br><p>For some reason Seyrina didn't try to pull onto the road, instead, she headed towards the far side of Fort Norton.</p><br><p>After a few turns, they drove under a steel curtain, moving through an empty, spacious room hidden beneath the fort. Several BH-01 fighters could easily fit here, despite their massive size.</p><br><p>The echoes were ready to spread hundreds of meters at any sound, the white lamps built into the walls, the only source of light in this vast hall.</p><br><p>As they descended disappearing beneath the fort, Seyrina accelerated even harder, going to squeeze the most out of the car.</p><br><p>With a piercing sound, the car turned into a black flash moving quickly down the secret path for millions, a seemingly endless tunnel.</p><br><p>Adam remained in silence, watching as white lights streaked around like stars in the night sky.</p><br><p>It reminded him of the high-speed trains when he first traveled to the First Ring, but now they were raging cars at full speed.</p><br><p>A shiver ran through his body from time to time, gradually beginning to recoil in his heart with anxiety.</p><br><p>'The Zero Ring... I don't even have an idea what could be there... Nobles? They've taken their place. The government? No, that's out of the question. The common people know where all the government buildings are, mostly in the center of the First Ring.'</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam's eyes lowered, peering forward. The pale blue light at the end of the path grew brighter and brighter, risking to blind them when they got too close.</p><br><p>'Well, I'll find out soon enough.'</p>
