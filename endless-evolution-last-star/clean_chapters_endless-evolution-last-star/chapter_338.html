            <br><p>No matter that Plague Reaper was a Top-1 monster, he was still a Purple Threat monster and not someone who could easily defeat even K3-Phantoms.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper and the Phantoms before him were on the same level and were each other's natural enemies. Golden Light Squad, and especially Adam, were not simple K1-Phantoms, and neither was Plague Reaper just a strong monster.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper couldn't just kill them all in one attack or break their bones with his aura, he wasn't that omnipotent.</p><br><p>Thus, their attacks were dangerous to Plague Reaper, which was why he did his best to repel Erla's shot because he knew what would happen if her attack hit the target.</p><br><p>And... Oskar's massive sword, empowered with light energy from his Second Nexus Trait, was a real threat that could end Plague Reaper's life in one precise swing. </p><br><p>In a few seconds more Oskar's sword would plunge into Plague Reaper's neck, severing his head.</p><br><p>Could Plague Reaper have let that happen? Of course not.</p><br><p>Katrin's roots were holding Plague Reaper in one place, in any other situation he would have been able to destroy them utmost quickly, but now he didn't even have a few seconds.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Plague Reaper's coat began to shake vigorously, revealing that the material from which the coat was made was not cloth at all, but something more complex and sinister....</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper swung his arm, lifting his coat, covering the right side - where Oskar was. It seemed as if he was going to defend himself from Oskar's attack by putting his coat under the strike.</p><br><p>But... if Plague Reaper only possessed black air and impressive physical power, he wouldn't be able to become a Top-1 monster.</p><br><p>There was the sound of clamping teeth like a piranha before devouring its prey.</p><br><p>Then, a ghastly jaw with many white teeth and four long fangs emerged from the black coat, a long red tongue twitching from side to side in anticipation before a delicious meal.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Oskar's eyes went wide.</p><br><br><p>The jaw completely engulfed Oskar's left arm, crumpling his armor into nothingness and sinking its fangs into his flesh.</p><br><p>Despite the bright, blazing pain that spread through Oskar's body, his mind paid no attention to it, for he was in genuine shock, unable to understand how things could have come to this.</p><br><br><p>The jaw turned sharply, tearing through Oskar's flesh and breaking his bones. Then, the jaw swallowed his arm, returning to the coat and pressing against the Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>Oskar's eyes went wide, he glanced at the crimson puddle that was on the floor from the open wound on his arm and looked at his sword which was still charged with energy.</p><br><p>'Right, I can still attack. If he took my arm, I'll take his head!' Oskar inwardly exclaimed, going to continue his attack.</p><br><p>He was seriously weakened, he had to hold his sword with one hand, but he had already decided that he would attack Plague Reaper when they came up with this plan with Erla and Katrin. Now, he had the willpower to continue what he had started.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper's coat trembled, and a crimson energy began to emanate from it that headed towards Plague Reaper's hand. This energy his coat had received after devouring Oskar's arm and now, Plague Reaper was ready to return this power to its original owner.</p><br><p>"Rgh..." Plague Reaper took a deep breath with a heavy wheeze before plunging his fist into Oskar's stomach.</p><br><p>His fist, sheathed in white bandages and covered in dense crimson energy that enveloped it like blood, slammed into Oskar's armor, crumpling it like a piece of paper.</p><br><p>The impact caused a shockwave followed by an air ring and a loud slam spreading around.</p><br><p>The armor shattered, Oskar's bones cracked before a few of his ribs broke and his internal organs went through a living hell.</p><br><p>Then, a pulse traveled through Oskar's entire body, tearing his feet off the ground and sending him into flight.</p><br><br><p>Oskar crashed into the blank wall behind Fume Throne, a crack spreading away from his plunged body into the cold stone. A few pieces of debris fell to the floor, but not Oskar, his arms and legs were sealed into the wall as if he had been nailed.</p><br><p>Suddenly, Plague Reaper spat out a clot of blood with a pained face before looking at his right arm, the bandages on which had been torn apart by such a powerful blow.</p><br><p>'I see...' Adam internally muttered carefully studying Plague Reaper's reaction, 'That punch was incredibly powerful, but he won't be able to use his strange coat too often.'</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Plague Reaper's coat whose jaw had already disappeared.</p><br><p>'To do that he needs the coat to absorb someone's flesh, transfer its energy to him, and Plague Reaper will attack, releasing that power but also facing destructive pressure. The recoil would simply destroy his body if he did this several times in a row.'</p><br><p>Adam as well as the others didn't know that Plague Reaper had such a dangerous trump card, but he tried to learn as much as he could about his opponent while he had the chance.</p><br><br><p>Plague Reaper stepped forward, but he wasn't heading towards Adam or the others but towards Oskar as if he wasn't done yet.</p><br><p>Oskar's massive sword lay at his feet, he cast a quick glance at the weapon and effortlessly picked it up with one hand.</p><br><p>"What, what is he doing...?" Lero muttered in a trembling voice.</p><br><p>He watched as Plague Reaper bent backward, drawing his sword for a throw, like a spearman ready to strike his target with a precise attack.</p><br><p>"NO!" Adam exclaimed turning into a lightning flash, but it was already too late.</p><br><br><p>With a cracked stone platform beneath Plague Reaper's feet, he threw the massive sword hurtling through the wind currents, heading straight for Oskar.</p><br><p>Oskar's eyes went up, seeing how his own sword, was about to take his life.</p><br><p>'Fuck... Is this really my end?'</p><br><p>Oskar muttered before his eyes reflected the white flash crashing into his sword.</p>
