            <br><p>'Something's wrong... I noticed it earlier, but now I can feel it. My punches, it's like they become ten times weaker when they collide with Damien...' Adam internally muttered as he made another strike.</p><br><br><p>At high speed, from bottom to top, his fist slammed straight into Damien's stomach. Waves of shivers ran through Adam's arm, the energy cover shuddered as the fast momentum headed forward.</p><br><br><p>There was a thud, one of the most powerful blows Adam had ever thrown with his fist, but... there was almost no effect.</p><br><p>Damien only let out a slight sigh before continuing to attack.</p><br><p>'Fuck... How is this even possible? If I hit Plague Reaper with that much force, even if I didn't kill him, I would definitely break his ribs or severely damage his organs! But... Damien just doesn't care though we're on the same level right now!'</p><br><br><p>Two black flashes swept before Adam's eyes as diagonal cuts appeared on his chest.</p><br><p>Then, before he could do anything, Damien's foot plunged into his stomach, causing Adam's eyes to go wide from the sudden burst of vivid pain.</p><br><p>"Adam, you still have much to learn, but I must commend you. You gave a more worthy fight than I expected." Damien said before jumping up and making a sharp turn in the air.</p><br><p>The next thing Adam saw was Damien's foot which like a spear crashed straight into his face at tremendous speed.</p><br><p>The impact threw Adam aside like a projectile, as a consequence he crashed into the wall, a gush of blood pouring out of his mouth.</p><br><p>A loud rumble spread around along with a rising cloud of dust trying to hide Adam's hard position.</p><br><br><p>Damien could end their fight right now, but he was here to teach Adam something new and help him get used to the abilities not to reveal a winner.</p><br><p>"Honestly, I thought by this point the score wouldn't be 3-2 but 10-0 or something like that, but you managed to pull off some local wins." Damien said before he stopped.</p><br><p>He looked up and took a deep breath.</p><br><p>"My hat... When I offered you that condition I didn't think you could even damage it, but you knocked it off my head and destroyed it."</p><br><p>Damien said in a low voice before shrugging his shoulders.</p><br><p>"But, everything comes to an end just like this fight."</p><br><p>The whole time Adam was silent, he didn't even move or try to look at Damien. His mind seemed to be busy with something more important. Perhaps he was trying to think of a plan of action since his attacks were useless against Damien.</p><br><p>"There won't even be a final attack? Well, suit yourself." Damien sighed.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Damien gripped the rod tightly and threw it straight at Adam at a great speed like a spear.</p><br><br><p>Without a stir, the sharp rod plunged straight into Adam's left shoulder, sinking halfway into his flesh. Blood rushed out, while thick crimson streams ran down his chest.</p><br><p>However... even that didn't make Adam act.</p><br><p>Then, Damien had an idea of what might have happened.</p><br><p>"Oh... right, I hit him right on the head, I guess that had a greater effect on him than I expected." Damien muttered scratching the back of his head, then he glanced at Dahla.</p><br><p>She understood his intentions and quickly exited the spectator room. A few seconds later the mechanical doors opened and Dahla headed towards Adam.</p><br><p>"Heal him. Looks like my last attack was stronger than I realized." Damien waved a hand scratching the back of his head.</p><br><p>Dahla nodded respectfully.</p><br><p>"Sure, I'll get right on it."</p><br><p>She gave Adam a quick look, took a step forward, and held out her hand about to apply the energy.</p><br><br><p>Adam roughly threw Dahla's hand away, starting to move for the first time in a long time.</p><br><p>"No... Go away, if you heal me it will be 4:2... I can't let that happen..." Adam uttered in a hoarse voice.</p><br><p>Dahla looked at Adam for a while before saying: "Adam, you are hurt, you need my help. Your head is most likely badly damaged. Let me help you."</p><br><br><p>Adam quickly pulled the rod out of his shoulder before slowly rising from the ground, walking next to Dahla.</p><br><p>She wanted to stop him, but... as soon as she saw his gaze she stopped her attempts. Adam wasn't even looking at her, all his attention was focused solely on Damien and his energy was condensed in his hands.</p><br><p>"Hmm...? Do you really have something else left...?" Damien muttered, confused.</p><br><br><p>Adam moved forward, leaving Dahla behind who watched him with real interest. She didn't know what he was going to do and it fascinated her.</p><br><p>Soon the energy from the recesses in the gauntlets began to come out quickly in thick streams of energy. They headed towards Adam's right hand transforming into a full-fledged needle again.</p><br><p>The needle looked the same as before, the sharp blades, the menacing shape, and the sharp tip, but there was one difference...</p><br><p>The recess in the middle of the needle that had been empty before was now rapidly filling with energy.</p><br><p>In just a few seconds, a snow-white line was now shining brightly in the middle of the needle.</p><br><br><p>Adam let out a strange sigh as his eyes grew deeper.</p><br><p>At the same moment, energy began to emerge from the tip of his needle, like a stream heading towards Adam's arm and covering the entire length of the needle, reaching Adam's wrist.</p><br><p>"Damien... This is my final attack..." Adam muttered in a weak voice before drawing his leg back, getting a suitable stance.</p><br><p>He leaned his torso slightly forward and placed his other hand on his wrist, wanting to hold his needle as firmly and confidently as possible.</p><br><p>"Hah, I got it. In that case, don't disappoint me!" Damien exclaimed with a wave of the black rod. He was going to take Adam's attack no matter how dangerous it would be.</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly.</p><br><p>"Sure, you can rest assured."</p><br><p>Adam said his last words before stepping forward.</p><br><p>A pulse went through his entire body, his eyes shone brightly as he turned into a snow-white flash rushing towards his target possessing the power to pierce anything, even a creature close to a god.</p>
