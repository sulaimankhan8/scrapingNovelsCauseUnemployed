            <br><p>"So... Our first morning as a couple didn't turn out to be the most ordinary..." Silvana muttered, continuing to look at Adam.</p><br><p>They were still in bed, their heads on the soft pillows and their bodies naked.</p><br><p>"Yeah... but... What's that mark in your left eye?"</p><br><p>"Agh...? A mark? What are you talking about?"</p><br><p>Silvana stood up as she quickly headed towards the mirror. Full of curiosity, Adam followed her.</p><br><p>"Wow... This looks so unusual..." Silvana touched her face, "But at the same time it's so beautiful..."</p><br><p>Silvana's left eye underwent severe changes, but they were temporary. With each passing second, the star grew dimmer, however, it was still a long way away from disappearing completely.</p><br><p>"Hey, let's not waste any time." Adam touched her shoulder, "The voice said we got a new ability, but I don't feel any powers in me."</p><br><p>"Well, I think I know what to do."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in disbelief.</p><br><br><p>Silvana nodded deeply as she looked at him.</p><br><p>"I'd like to say it's intuition, but it's something stronger and deeper. Anyway, I felt something similar when I did the Pain Transition, so just give me some time."</p><br><p>Saying nothing, Adam raised his hands and took a few steps back.</p><br><p>For a while, only Silvana's heavy sighs were heard, until at one point she abruptly turned around.</p><br><p>With a serious face, Silvana reached forward with her hand, clenching her fist tightly as if there was something inside.</p><br><p>As soon as her fist opened her left eye shone with renewed vigor.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the same thing happened to Adam's eye, only the right one.</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam's right eye changed from blue to green, but by the first energy surges it went back to normal.</p><br><br><p>Adam's hair whipped upward, while white streams swept quickly before his eyes. It was energy, not an aura.</p><br><p>However, normally his energy would shoot out in all directions like an active flame, now his energy was moving upward like a powerful gust of wind.</p><br><p>A four-pointed star appeared in his right eye, completing the contact between him and Silvana.</p><br><p>Then, all his muscles tensed and his veins swelled with a rush of blood. His vision became sharper, his instincts more extensive, and even his energy reserves visibly increased.</p><br><p>Soon, the veins reached his face, stopping under his eyelids before reaching his eyes.</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana looked at each other. Everything seemed obvious from the name of the ability, but reading it and seeing it in practice were very different things.</p><br><br><p>Adam looked at his hands, at the trembling veins among the twitching muscles.</p><br><p>"This is a Resonance, though no... This is better than a standard Resonance, I can feel it. I'm not just at the limit of my strength, I've gotten extra energy, but... the best part is different."</p><br><p>With disbelief in his gaze, Adam stared at Silvana.</p><br><p>"Thanks to you, I can enter an enhanced resonance at any moment!"</p><br><p>Before Silvana could reply, Adam was in front of her, clutching her tightly. He lifted her high up, looking at her like a treasure with a happy smile.</p><br><p>"This is incredible!"</p><br><p>"Thanks... but I didn't do anything special..." Silvana muttered, her face full of embarrassment.</p><br><p>"Hah! The Stellar Resonance! I'm sure this is just the beginning!" Adam exclaimed before lowering Silvana to the ground.</p><br><p>A flame burned in his eyes, he hadn't felt like this in a long time, for this was different from when he got his abilities.</p><br><p>Not only was he stronger now, but Silvana became more powerful as well.</p><br><p>Silvana smiled bitterly as she watched Adam happy as a child.</p><br><p>'Well, isn't this what I wanted? I've become more useful as an Operator and now Adam and I are more than fighting partners... That kiss was one of the best decisions I ever made.'</p><br><p>Then, she bit her lip.</p><br><p>"Hey, Adam," her gaze ran down Adam's body, "With those swollen veins and muscles... you look so damn hot."</p><br><p>Without further ado, Silvana pounced on Adam, flopping him onto the bed.</p><br><p>The next time they decided to get out of bed wasn't until later in the evening.</p><br><p>They had nowhere to rush, the new ability wouldn't go away, and their flames burned hard, wanting to do as much as possible in the early hours of their relationship.</p><br><p>Time wouldn't run anywhere, but their hearts demanded it.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, life in the Twilight Palace continued.</p><br><p>Some nobles were fighting against others, each trying to earn twilight coins and get the perfect score.</p><br><p>There were many places where battles could take place, but there were only two main ones - the Amber Cloud where Adam and Giselle had recently fought, and the North Arch.</p><br><p>The North Arch was the more popular of the two because unlike the Amber Cloud, where people came for food and drink, the North Arch was a place exclusively for battles.</p><br><p>Two golden bridges intersected, connecting four walls with ceilings over twenty meters high.</p><br><p>On the posts and in the walls was the spectator area while below was the arena.</p><br><p>It was a simple crossroads, at the huge Twilight Palace there were plenty. However, only at the North Arch were the spectator seats so convenient, as if in a theater where chambers were located right in the walls instead of the usual seats in front of the stage.</p><br><p>"Hey, that guy from Noukx Family looks pretty good," one of the spectators on the bridge said, pointing to a guy with turquoise hair.</p><br><p>That guy jumped forward, his daggers covered in blue flames, cold and wild.</p><br><p>"Yeah..." his buddy nodded, "I heard that after Kogen Noukx came to power, it changed the Noukx Family a lot. They're trying to become as powerful as him."</p><br><p>"Hah, that psycho Kogen? The youngest head of a great family, that's not an achievement you can easily beat."</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the young man from the Noukx Family attacked, his opponent, a girl from a noble family decided to try her luck against a high noble.</p><br><p>Among the spectators, there were representatives from almost all of the Twelve Branches families, but... someone stood out.</p><br><p>A young man with hair as white as snow and eyes as clear as diamonds - one of the Alderran Family, the first family of the Twelve Branches.</p>
