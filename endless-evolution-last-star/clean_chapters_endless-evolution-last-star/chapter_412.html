            <br><p>"That... that was my brother's weapon, wasn't it?" Glara asked in a trembling voice looking at the red book.</p><br><p>Their hands were still firmly grasping both sides of the book, which seemed to have a will of its own, but no one noticed it. Well, to notice something like that, one had to have a sense far superior to what K2-Phantom possessed.</p><br><p>"Yes, I'm sorry this happened, but if you don't accept this Nexus, the military will simply disassemble it for biomaterials. You as a family member have the right to keep Lero's Nexus as a memory of him." Adam said calmly.</p><br><p>He had come here for one purpose, to give Lero's Nexus to his family. He didn't have any ulterior motives, he just wanted to put an end to this story, primarily for himself.</p><br><p>"I get it... Thank you, I'm sure you did your best to prevent what happened, but... none of us can change the past, right?" Glara muttered with a bitter smile on her face.</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, finally letting go of the book, allowing Glara to wrap her arms completely around it and press it against his chest.</p><br><p>'How strange... Why do I feel like I'm sensing something from Glara? It feels like she's just gotten closer to me, not in terms of a relationship but in physical form...' Adam muttered internally, not quite sure what was going on.</p><br><p>Then, he scratched the back of his head with a confused face.</p><br><p>'Well, I guess I'm just imagining things. After all, killing monsters in Dead Lands is one thing, but informing a younger sister of her brother's death is a different story, probably considerably more difficult than most fights...' Adam pondered, deciding not to give it too much significance.</p><br><br><p>Adam and Glara just looked at each other, not knowing if they should have said anything.</p><br><p>"Khm, Glara forgive us, but we have important business to attend to, so we'll have to leave early." Silvana coughed, breaking the awkward pause and saving them both.</p><br><p>"Y-Yes... Silvana's right." Adam nodded a few times, realizing what Silvana was doing.</p><br><br><p>"Of course, I understand. Lero always had a lot on his plate, but despite that, he found time to be with us, with his family..."</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana glanced over as Silvana turned around, leaving the Fratto Family's house grounds.</p><br><br><p>Adam's hand fell on Glara's shoulder, making her eyes go wide for a moment.</p><br><p>"I know it may sound trivial, but Lero died like a hero trying to protect his mate."</p><br><p>Glara only smiled weakly. She realized that it was an honorable death, but... it was still a death that was worse than life in any way. At least because once a person was dead there was nothing they could do, as long as a person was alive they always had the chance to affect their fate.</p><br><p>Adam nodded one last time before leaving, following Silvana.</p><br><p>Glara raised her head looking at Adam leaving but didn't say anything, she only glanced at the red book and closed the door.</p><br><br><br><p>"I think that turned out pretty good." Silvana said quietly following Adam, they walked amongst the streets of the city, people occasionally turning around, glancing at Adam, either because they recognized him or because they noticed his NEP.</p><br><br><br><br><p>"What are you planning to do next? Are you going to head to the Lower Ring? Or would you rather do some training with Tron?"</p><br><p>Adam didn't answer. He stopped and looked up at the sun moving towards the horizon, sunset was about to begin soon.</p><br><p>"I'm not sure. I actually have a few things I have to do, I think I'll take some time to rest first. I've always been in a hurry to get back to Dead Lands as soon as possible, but... maybe I shouldn't rush things now."</p><br><p>Silvana smiled, she liked Adam's answer, not only because she also thought he should take a break, but because it was the answer of a grown man who already had some experience in life.</p><br><p>"In that case, I'll keep in touch. Contact me about anything. After all, if I don't have to run ten of your errands a day, I'll get bored." Silvana replied with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>"Sure." Adam sighed, feeling relieved.</p><br><br><br><p>That evening, Adam stood in front of the door where the last time he had been was quite a while ago. He felt guilty in front of this person. After all, he had consented to a certain kind of relationship even though he was completely unprepared for it.</p><br><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p><br><p>Adam knocked a few times on the door that opened less than a minute later revealing a girl with short purple hair and a slightly surprised look.</p><br><p>"Oh Adam, it's you... I didn't expect to see you today at all." Jena muttered, staring at Adam in surprise.</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, realizing that they hadn't seen each other in a while and he didn't warn her of his arrival.</p><br><p>"Jena... I think we should talk, about our relationship..." Adam mumbled uncertainly, but before the last words his look changed and his voice became serious.</p><br><p>"I think it was a mistake, my mistake."</p><br><br><p>At about the same time, a girl with shoulder-length brown hair and green eyes walked out of the store, returning home with her purchases.</p><br><p>Today, something good happened for her, but it still couldn't cover the tragedy their family was facing.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, a man in a black coat and a dark shirt like a butler appeared in front of her.</p><br><br><p>The girl crashed into the man's chest as her gaze was directed towards the ground.</p><br><p>Out of surprise, Glara looked up to see a man with short black hair and attractive facial features, his eyes were narrowed and a sly smile was on his face.</p><br><p>"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there."</p><br><p>The man said respectfully, leaning over and extending his hand.</p><br><br><p>Glara nodded slowly taking his hand.</p><br><p>"By the way, I have one question for you." The man smirked.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Glara looked at him baffled.</p><br><p>"Would you be interested in visiting Morton Observatory?"</p><br><p>A dangerous gleam passed across his eyes.</p><br><p>"No refusal accepted."</p>
