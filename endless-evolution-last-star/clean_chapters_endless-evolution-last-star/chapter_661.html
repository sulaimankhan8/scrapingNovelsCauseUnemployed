            <br><p>After a long bloody battle, Silvana came to her limit, but when she decided that she already lost, the situation started to show its true face.</p><br><p>A multitude of thoughts filled Silvana's mind, but she quickly dismissed them all, wanting to focus on only one thing - the long needle she held along with Adam.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The dense laser tried to destroy the silver needle just as it had done before with Silvana's scissors, but the needle seemed invulnerable.</p><br><p>The snow-white layer of energy emanating from the needle's tip and going all the way to their hands was their defense, preventing even the heat from reaching them. Silvana saw it many times, but she didn't realize it at the time.</p><br><p>"Good, just hold tight and don't let go of the hilt." Adam whispered next to Silvana's ear.</p><br><p>Then, he took hold of her waist and made her lean forward slightly, he did the same.</p><br><p>"Now we will deal with this serious opponent, for the first and last time."</p><br><p>Silvana didn't know how, but for the last few seconds, she was completely calm, her Operator's voice gave her boundless confidence, not only in her but in him as well.</p><br><p>"It's a strong attack, but you and I can do something more impressive..."</p><br><p>Then, Adam's and Silvana's eyes simultaneously shone brightly, this time the light in Silvana's eyes was as white as Adam's, rather than the black mist that covered her earlier.</p><br><br><p>Acting as one, Silvana and Adam stepped forward, creating a white stream of energy around them that created a path for them to follow.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, they swept across the great distance, finding themselves a few meters behind the Obsidian Hydra.</p><br><br><p>Silvana dropped to one knee, slowly turning around.</p><br><p>"Hah... That was a good attack, I don't even really understand what happened, but one thing is obvious, it's not enough to defeat such a powerful monster."</p><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana heard a stern voice:</p><br><p>"Silvana, raise your head and look."</p><br><p>Adam pointed at the Obsidian Hydra, pinning Silvana's gaze to the monster.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>A loud crack sounded from bones breaking as Obsidian Hydra collapsed to the ground under the weight of its own body.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide, staring at the wide hole, no... at the tunnel inside the two-meter diameter monster that was the aftermath of their charge.</p><br><p>Everything on the path they traveled was destroyed, leaving behind only emptiness.</p><br><p>"But... How?" Silvana looked at Adam, still not understanding what was happening here.</p><br><p>"Because Operators are strong too and... you proved it." Adam uttered as the wall behind him shattered into many shards.</p><br><p>Somehow, behind the cold cavern was only a snow-white void, blinding Silvana for a moment.</p><br><p>The next time she opened her eyes, she saw the darkness and the majestic Evolution Tree in front of her.</p><br><p>Then, Silvana's gaze changed, her eyes deepening, remembering everything that happened during the last ordeal.</p><br><p>"That... What was that?"</p><br><p>Confusion was visible on her face, as well as surprise, embarrassment, and many other emotions.</p><br><p>[That was the last one...]</p><br><p>After a few seconds, then Evolution Tree continued:</p><br><p>[And... I finally got an answer to my question...]</p><br><p>Silvana raised her head abruptly, addressing the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>"What? What are you talking about?"</p><br><p>[Don't you remember...? No... you... are... At the moment you woke up... then when you were in the illusion...]</p><br><p>For a moment, Silvana's eyes went wide, she clearly remembered what the Evolution Tree was talking about.</p><br><p>"Am I willing to sacrifice my life to save Adam...? But, I answered that I'm not." Silvana clenched her fists tightly, she didn't like that answer, but it was an honest one.</p><br><p>[Did...? It seems like you lied to me last time... Since I saw everything during the test...]</p><br><p>"But! I was a Phantom! I was strong! I had the ability to protect Adam! This... these are very different circumstances..." Silvana bit her lip, lowering her head down.</p><br><p>[No. You're wrong... Remember the situation. Even though you possessed Phantom powers... You had no chance to save Adam, your Operator...] Enjoy new tales from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><br><p>Silvana took some time to come to her senses, to ponder the words of the Evolution Tree, and to recall the events after White Cube...</p><br><p>"So... What will happen next?"</p><br><p>When Stina came to them, taking them to Iron Observatory to see Refesa, they were not told anything.</p><br><p>Even when they had already learned about Gene Diffusion, Refesa had only warned them about the consequences if they failed, but no one had told them what would happen if they could handle all the trials.</p><br><p>"Although... don't answer that. I want to ask you something before I do. It'll be fair." Silvana stared intently at Evolution Tree, expecting some sort of reaction from the still mysterious creature to her.</p><br><p>[I'm listening to you... I see something is bothering you...]</p><br><p>"Yes, why did the trials only affect me? I mean... I don't mind going through the trials, but, Adam only participated in one of the three."</p><br><br><p>"You only asked questions of me, then we watched each other's memories, and at the very end I was alone."</p><br><p>She waved her hand with a serious expression.</p><br><p>"I'm not complaining, I just want to know why Gene Diffusion is happening the way it is. Why does most of the work go to the Operator?"</p><br><p>[I see... First of all... Adam was in the last trial... I think you already realized that yourself...]</p><br><p>After a long silence, the Evolution Tree trembled slightly:</p><br><p>[You're right... the first trial was just for you, but... think about it... why did you end up here in the first place? You're not a Phantom... you're just a mere human...]</p><br><p>Shock covered Silvana's face, the Evolution Tree was right, over the course of the ordeal, she had already started to consider it normal that she was in Adam's inner space.</p><br><p>[The answer is simple, the fact that you're here... shows that Adam trusts you completely... otherwise I wouldn't allow you to be here... Silvana Desio.]</p><br><p>Silvana gulped but didn't say anything, she like the Evolution Tree, got answers to her questions.</p><br><p>[Well... that's enough... back to your last question and the end... There are no more trials... but... the Gene Diffusion isn't over yet...]</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree shuddered violently as its two massive roots headed towards Silvana. The roots stopped abruptly in the middle of the distance, slowly approaching Silvana, passing through the void as if the roots were spreading on the ground.</p><br><p>Soon, the roots stopped in front of Silvana, slowly rising, weaving together into a single one, with the tip looking upward.</p><br><p>Thin streams of white energy emerged from the tip, slowly turning into silver threads. The threads became spinning disks, inside lurked a small star the size of a fingernail, the entire sphere of threads from the star could fit in Silvana's palm.</p><br><p>Holding her breath, Silvana watched as the light of the star faded, revealing a tiny round object, slightly stretched forward, flawlessly pure and white as the first snow, emitting a powerful calm aura.</p><br><p>[Silvana Desio... now I have a question for you...]</p><br><p>Silvana's heart began to beat faster, for some reason, she couldn't look away from the silver sphere, the threads slowly spinning, protecting the treasure within.</p><br><p>[Will you accept a small gift from me... will you accept my seed?]</p>
