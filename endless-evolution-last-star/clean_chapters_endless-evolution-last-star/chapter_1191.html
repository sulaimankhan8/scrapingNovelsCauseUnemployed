            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1191: Colony (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Adam’s strongest ability before the Imaginary Cut was his path. He knew it, Silvana knew it, and everyone who had fought against him knew it.</p><br><p>Almost all of Adam’s enemies were now dead. This was not surprising because if he had to use the path against someone, it meant it was a deadly fight.</p><br><p>Well, Fromund was one of the few exceptions.</p><br><p>He was able to survive Adam’s path, but it was one of the most powerful attacks he had ever faced. If he himself weren’t an extra-class fighter, he would have lost at that very moment or even died.</p><br><p>Now, he had the opportunity to observe this power from the sidelines, and he was completely satisfied.</p><br><p>Then, he looked at Adam, who was standing in the middle of the destroyed seal.</p><br><p>“Mission accomplished?” Fromund asked with a wide smile.</p><br><br><p>“Well, if our goal was to deal with all the guards, then yes. Shall we return to the Citadel?”</p><br><p>“Hahaha! I thought you’d never crack a joke! Although it wasn’t the best one, you know?”</p><br><p>In response, Adam rolled his eyes.</p><br><p>“Come on, soon we won’t have time for jokes or even to breathe easily. I can feel it.”</p><br><p>Strangely, Fromund didn’t answer.</p><br><p>A few seconds before Adam used the great path to destroy the seal, Fromund felt a powerful aura quickly moving towards them.</p><br><p>It was very far away, dozens of kilometers, but it felt like someone dangerous was looking at his back as if he were their prey.</p><br><p>They didn’t know who it was, but their instincts told them that the Kirani Bugs wouldn’t be their biggest problem.</p><br><p>At least not until they encountered the Queen. She was ready to defend her subjects and her home from two invaders.</p><br><p>“What do you think awaits us ahead?” Fromund asked as he looked at the wide tunnel leading much deeper than the first one at the passage.</p><br><p>“It looks like we’re going to the very depths of this colony. I don’t think these bugs will be happy to see us, but our task is to find the Twilight Crystals. We must determine where they are. That’s the main part.”</p><br><p>Fromund nodded as they both jumped down.</p><br><p>True, finding the Twilight Crystals was difficult, but if one was close by, the task became much easier.</p><br><p>Moreover, Adam understood that the Kirani Colony had long since found all the Twilight Crystals on their territory. Obviously, there must be many guards near each Twilight Crystal to protect such a valuable treasure.</p><br><p>At the same time, dozens of thunder monsters followed Marhen, who led them through an underground tunnel, moving straight to where Adam and Fromund were headed — to the depths of the Karani Colony.</p><br><br><p>The sound of footsteps echoed off the walls while blue flames reflected off the columns supporting the passageway, along with the great walls.</p><br><p>“Hahah, we’re finally going to get that Twilight Crystal!” One of the monsters said with a predatory gleam in his eyes.</p><br><p>Another, calmer one, shook his head.</p><br><p>“That’s not a given. Miss Bathild may decide to leave the Twilight Crystal to accumulate more energy before absorbing it.”</p><br><p>“Tsk. What difference does it make?!” His friend waved his fist in irritation. “The main thing is that we finally fulfill our part of the bargain with that queen!”</p><br><p>They were all the Awakened Ones, preferring to remain in their human forms. Many monsters did so. Those like Lyrod, who took their monster form more often, were significantly fewer.</p><br><p>In a way, it was as natural for them as it was for humans, since the Crown Type monsters were also in human form, even though they were not the Awakened Monsters.</p><br><p>A third joined them.</p><br><p>“The problem is something else. Why did the Kirani Queen finally decide to ask Miss Bathild for help? The Kirani Colony has had many problems over the past few years, but the Queen didn’t dare to do this even then.”</p><br><p>“Pffft!” The second monster snorted. “What does it matter? I heard they’re just two Phantoms. I’m sure that before we get there, Bathild will tear them to pieces, or the Kirani Keepers or even the Kirani Sentinels will do it.”</p><br><p>However, the other monsters were not as optimistic as that one.</p><br><p>The third monster looked around, narrowing his eyes suspiciously.</p><br><p>“Nah, if it were that simple, Miss Bathild wouldn’t have asked Marhen to gather us all. No, that’s not even it. If this were a threat that the Kirani Queen could handle on her own, she wouldn’t have used her part of the contract like she did before.”</p><br><p>Many monsters shared his opinion. They understood that these two Phantoms were dangerous, but they were also completely confident that they could defeat them with ease.</p><br><p>After all, there were several dozen of them, and on their side were Bathild, Marhen, and Kirani Queen with her countless warriors, while against them were only two Phantoms.</p><br><p>Then, amid the whispering, someone said:</p><br><p>“This… This could be Adam Vinter.”</p><br><p>Even though the girl spoke very quietly, dozens of monsters stopped. They stared at her as if she had said something ridiculous.</p><br><p>“What? What did you say?”</p><br><p>“No… That’s impossible. What is he doing here?”</p><br><p>“R-Right! How do you know it’s him?! It could be any other Phantom!”</p><br><p>The girl frowned, annoyed by their disbelief.</p><br><p>“Because I saw him from afar! I saw him fall out of the fighter jet and land at the Corrupted Volcano, but I didn’t think he would go to the Kirani Colony!”</p><br><p>The monsters looked at each other. Some of them knew that the girl had returned to the Thunder Peaks recently, so now it was clear to them where she had been.</p><br><p>“What about the second Phantom? Do you know who that is?”</p><br><br><p>“No… I didn’t recognize him. If he’s Adam Vinter’s ally, then he must be someone powerful!”</p><br><p>The monsters were about to ask the girl a bunch of questions when a turquoise flame shot over them.</p><br><p>“Silence!” Marhen’s voice boomed for hundreds of meters. “Stop acting like a bunch of cowards! We’ll help our allies like we agreed and destroy everyone in our way. Is that clear?!”</p><br>
