            <br><p>"Training plan?" Silvana asked. There was a bright look of curiosity in her eyes.</p><br><p>She made arrangements with Tron to train Adam, but she didn't discuss anything else with him. She, like Adam, one day received a message that she needed to come to the Gray Castle and that was the end of it.</p><br><p>Dahla nodded slightly.</p><br><p>"Yeah, according to his plan, Adam wasn't supposed to move on to battle against Max until the third day of training, that's at best. Normally he expected to get to that point on the fifth day."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes filled with puzzlement. She didn't understand why Tron's training plan was stretched so much.</p><br><p>"But... Why? Doesn't that mean Tron miscalculated a lot?"</p><br><p>"Well, you're right in one way." Dahla shrugged nonchalantly, "But I know Tron well. If he decided to do something, he did it with seriousness and persistence. He had his reasons for considering it so."</p><br><br><p>"I think the point is that he didn't expect Adam to learn how to use the Energy Control so quickly. Sure, he still has a long way to go to learn that ability fully, but he was able to take the first step almost instantly."</p><br><p>All the while, Riska listened intently to their conversation, in silence.</p><br><p>But, when it came to Adam and Tron, she decided to join them: "Tron prefers to leave time in case something goes wrong. Though honestly, it's not surprising that Adam managed to succeed so quickly with the Energy Control, is it?" Riska smiled slightly, glaring at Dahla.</p><br><p>Raising her eyes and looking at Adam, Dahla nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"You're right. Considering how many dangerous fights he's been through, it's no wonder his energy obeyed him so quickly. Well, that's normal. There are many ineffective rules in our world, but that certainly doesn't apply to bloody battles." Read the latest on empire</p><br><p>Dahla tilted her head intently looking at Adam, who along with Tron and Max was heading in their direction.</p><br><p>"If you survive bloody battles, you always come back with valuable experience that you can't get anywhere else."</p><br><br><p>Max stepped forward as he waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Hey, girls, didn't you miss us?" Max smiled, then he walked over to the table and picked up a few chocolate cookies, stuffing them into his mouth.</p><br><p>"Damn! I want one too!" Adam exclaimed vigorously as he did the same.</p><br><p>Riska smiled kindly. She slowly stood up and headed towards the kitchen, going to make tea for them.</p><br><p>"When we were fighting in the blue zone, I didn't feel hungry at all, but after a few minutes passed, the hunger came in a powerful wave! It felt like I hadn't eaten in days!" Adam said, unable to get enough of the simple cookies.</p><br><p>Max nodded quietly. Unlike Adam, he had used Blue Zone: Imagination many times before.</p><br><p>"Yeah, it happens every time. On one hand, it's good, nothing distracts you, but on the other hand, feeling so hungry so abruptly is always unexpected."</p><br><br><p>Tron sat down in his chair and placed his feet on the table. Across from him sat Dahla, but it didn't bother him, well... it was unlikely that Dahla would say anything to him about it.</p><br><p>Then, Tron pulled out his phone and tapped the screen a few times as if he was ordering something.</p><br><p>"Good job. Though I'm not your babysitter Adam, I'm your coach, but eating well is a must for fast progress. By the way, why haven't you done a hundred push-ups yet?"</p><br><p>Adam and Max looked at each other.</p><br><p>"Right... Fuck, I lost for the 28th time! Damn, I've never lost that many in one day in my life!"</p><br><p>Adam put the cookies aside and leaned back against the floor.</p><br><p>For the next thirty minutes, they just talked to each other, enjoying the sweets and tea from Riska.</p><br><p>Even though the cookies were high in calories and sugar, and therefore in carbs, they weren't exactly hearty.</p><br><p>Another ten or twenty minutes would pass and Adam would be hungry again. Well, he wasn't really satiated, the cookies only managed to satisfy his hunger a little.</p><br><p>Tron was well aware of that, which is why soon the gate in the training hall opened.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, it wasn't a human, but a drone carrying several large pizzas.</p><br><p>"Don't be surprised." Tron shrugged turning to Silvana and Adam, "It's not convenient or profitable to keep a cook here all the time, so when someone is training here the best way to get food is by delivery."</p><br><p>Silvana looked at the drone flying towards them.</p><br><p>It was no ordinary drone, it was completely black and had the emblem of the Dark Order on it.</p><br><p>"Oh, I see... I take it this drone got the food somewhere else rather than a courier coming here."</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, these pizzas are from the nearest town. There aren't very many restaurants and cafes located there, but we certainly won't starve to death. After all, this is a remote area in the Second Ring, not the densely populated First Ring."</p><br><p>Silvana smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"It's an interesting system. So... when do we get home?" Silvana asked.</p><br><p>Unlike Adam and Max, whose eyes were fixed on the pizzas flying towards them, Silvana wasn't hungry. Her mind wasn't consumed with thoughts of how to satisfy her hunger.</p><br><p>"Hmm? What are you talking about?" Tron raised an eyebrow, slightly surprised, "The training will last 84 days, until the wedding between the Rouzet Family and the Marzo family. Until that day, we all stay here in the Gray Castle."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide. She was already thinking about how she was going to get home and planning her next day, but it looked like she didn't need to leave.</p><br><p>Tron waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Well, you can go home if you want, but then you'll have to waste time traveling twice a day, here and back. Considering where the Gray Castle is, that would take too long."</p><br><p>"I see..." Silvana muttered quietly.</p><br><p>A drone flew in front of her, carrying pizzas that in a few seconds were on the table.</p><br><p>"Finally!" Adam exclaimed before opening the first box and ripping off a slice.</p><br><p>"Hey. Take your time!" Max uttered, hurriedly picking out a pizza for himself.</p><br><p>"Hah, there's enough for everyone, you better enjoy your food instead of shoving it in your mouth." Riska said with a caring smile on her face.</p><br><p>Watching all of this, Tron leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes immersing himself in his thoughts.</p><br><p>'Well, Riska was right. This training is turning out to be a great vacation.'</p><br><p>Then, he opened his eyes slightly looking at Adam, who hadn't taken Riska's advice and was eating one slice of pizza after another.</p><br><p>'I wonder who the Marzo Family will put up against him? In 84 days, no, in 83 days by now, Adam will be a genuine monster. I'm sure of it since I'm personally responsible for it.'</p><br><p>Tron continued his musings:</p><br><p>'They'll obviously be unhappy that some non-noble Phantom decided to interfere in their affairs, but... Hah, what will those fucking weaklings be able to do? It's all about power! If they're not strong enough to protect their wedding, then they have no right to do so!'</p><br><p>With a slight smirk on his face, Tron closed his eyes again enjoying the warm, pleasant atmosphere.</p>
