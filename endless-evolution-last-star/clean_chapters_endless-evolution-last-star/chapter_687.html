            <br><p>The white threads trembled slightly, slowly dissipating into bits of energy. Adam had no use for his Second Order, as his opponent was defeated in a decent fight.
</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.
</p><br><p>The purple heart continued to beat slowly, but it would soon be over, it was only a pulse working on inertia.
</p><br><p>Adam didn’t bother to destroy the monster’s heart or mutilate the Solitary Commander’s body, there was no need for that.
</p><br><br><p>Slowly, Adam leaned over and placed the purple heart in the Solitary Commander’s right hand, stripped of its sharp claws of his own free will.
</p><br><p>The dividing barrier disappeared, but neither Shadow Walkers nor Dark Watchers rushed to attack Adam. As with runes and flames, the monsters needed a reason to assault Adam.
</p><br><p>At least that was how the fortress worked for the moment...
</p><br><p>The Solitary Commander’s eyes were already empty. He only suffered a few wounds during this fight, but one of them was so serious that it ended their battle in a moment.
</p><br><p>After patting the Solitary Commander on the shoulder a few times, Adam turned around, directing his gaze towards the purple sphere.
</p><br><p>Unlike the barrier, it was still on its meteor, soaring high above the square, glaring at every monster with its arrogant gaze.
</p><br><p>His eyes grew deeper. Find more chapters on NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>"So, what’s next? You offered me the usual reward, but I refused and chose to fight hard. What will you give me in return?"
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the purple sphere wasn’t going to make him wait for an answer, instead, it just flew away in an unknown direction.
</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" Adam muttered in confusion.
</p><br><p>The purple sphere flew too fast and on a complicated trajectory, showing that there was no point in Adam chasing after it.
</p><br><p>Left alone in the arena, Adam looked around, as before the monsters didn’t want to fight him.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Soon enough, he noticed that the crimson spear was trembling slightly, stronger and stronger.
</p><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana’s voice rang out as the fight was over.
</p><br><p>’Adam, I guess you’ll have to pick up that spear, even though it might be dangerous.’
</p><br><p>"Yeah, it looks like it, though I don’t think anything bad will happen."
</p><br><br><p>In a few large steps, Adam found himself in front of the crimson spear, flaming ripples began to run along its blade as if to show that Adam was doing the right thing.
</p><br><p>"After all, this is what I fought for. Though the Solitary Commander wasn’t as strong an opponent as my more serious adversaries, it was a good glimpse of what was in store for me."
</p><br><br><p>Adam brought his foot down sharply on the ground, causing a powerful shudder that threw the spear high enough for him to catch it, gripping the black hilt tightly.
</p><br><p>This was definitely not the type of weapon Adam was going to use, though his needle and spear had a lot in common: both were well suited to piercing through armor.
</p><br><p>Moreover, Adam didn’t think that the crimson spear was a real weapon since it was related to the fortress and External Artifact.
</p><br><p>At first, nothing happened, but once crimson spear realized that only Adam was the winner in the square, everything changed.
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the spear ignited with a bright flame, so powerful and hot that it melted in an instant, turning into a thick mass flowing down Adam’s arm like magma.
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes went wide, a bright pain went through his arm, the magma leaving severe burns in less than he had time to realize anything.
</p><br><p>"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! What the hell is this!" Adam exclaimed furiously, waving his hand from side to side, trying to ease the heat.
</p><br><p>Yet, the magma clung tightly to his hand, not even a drop flew off to the side, and his Nexus was unable to protect him, the temperatures were too great.
</p><br><p>But, before the burns could become too severe, the magma glowed brightly splitting into two streams, red and purple.
</p><br><p>The purple stream ran all over Adam’s body, having the same effect as the four-pointed star.
</p><br><p>The active pain changed to relief, ending Adam’s agony and the fiery heat making him feel as if his hand was in the depths of a volcano.
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, breathing a sigh of relief, Adam looked down at the red stream of flame swirling around his index finger.
</p><br><p>"Hmm... Wait, you wanna...?"
</p><br><br><p>Without waiting for his consent, forcibly giving him the prize of victory, the flames turned into a heavy black ring with lava veins.
</p><br><p>On top of the ring was a crimson spear-shaped hollow, working like a seal.
</p><br><p>Adam turned around, glancing occasionally at the monsters and the magma ring. No one was going to explain it to him and... his Operator couldn’t help him either.
</p><br><p>’I’m sorry, but I have no idea what happened here. I’ll try to find some information, though there doesn’t seem to be any updated articles about the External Artifact here in the database.’
</p><br><p>True, usually the Operators had information on everything that happened in the Dead Lands, but that wasn’t always the case for the Wild Lands, especially when it came to the Red Zones.
</p><br><p>Unlike the Pacific Lands, the Wild Lands changed much faster, and the Pacific Lands’ artificiality and the Wild Lands’ naturalness were strongly reflected in this.
</p><br><p>Thus, there were almost no cases when Phantom found something new and unexplored in the Pacific Lands, but it occasionally happened in the Wild Lands.
</p><br><p>Even if a place or location wasn’t new, within it like in a fortress, the rules could change, other monsters could appear, or even an External Artifact might come into play.
</p><br><p>Obviously, the rarer the Phantoms went to a certain location, the less information the Operators and military had - the Red Zones were the most obvious examples of such places.
</p><br><p>That didn’t mean Silvana didn’t know anything more about the fortress, but she didn’t have information about the spear that turned into a ring.
</p><br><br><p>Adam blinked a few times before smiling slightly, feeling the vibrations running through his arm.
</p><br><p>"Well, I won’t need your help this time. This artifact will take me where I need to go."
</p><br><p>At the same moment, the magma ring shuddered releasing a stream of dense energy, like a thread running along the ground into the depths of the fortress, willing Adam to go to the lowest point.</p>
