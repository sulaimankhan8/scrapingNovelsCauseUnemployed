            <h4>Chapter 1024: Salvation for a dark soul (Part 2)</h4><br><p>Slowly, Adam pulled his palm from Arnoth’s chest, letting his broad back fall to the ground. Lost Light was beside him, slowly disappearing into tiny particles.
</p><br><p>"Agh..." Arnoth wheezed, blood flowing from the corner of his mouth in an endless stream. "When I die, don’t let our energy dissipate, you know what needs to be done."
</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply. "Sure. If this is your last wish, then I will fulfill it. What’s more, I’ll be able to fully grant the Crimson Monarch’s death request. In a way, you’re saving me."
</p><br><p>"Hah..." he smiled bitterly, touching Lost Light’s gentle hands. "What about you, Adam? You won, but... perhaps there’s something you want to say or ask...? Ah... We’ll never meet again."
</p><br><p>Then, Adam’s eyes went wide.
</p><br><p>Even before the battle against Arnoth and Kreyna, he wanted to ask them some questions. It was one of his main goals. However, he completely forgot about it in the heat of battle.
</p><br><p>He could hardly be blamed for that. He’d almost been killed several times during the battle. Arnoth showed a superior strength that neither the Crimson Monarch nor the Plague Reaper possessed. The gap in their power was fearful.
</p><br><p>Kreyna was already dead, but Arnoth still had some time in this world.
</p><br><p>"Yes, actually, I want to know something."
</p><br><p>Adam leaned in to hear Arnoth’s every word, his voice growing fainter by the second.
</p><br><p>"The black flash through which you appeared. Who are you obeying? Where did you come from? You and Kreyna, you are monsters, but you were different from the others, you and the Crimson Monarch. You have been careful with what you say, but your attitude towards me and the serpents as too young creatures... shows your great age, there must be some reason behind it."
</p><br><p>There was no surprise on Arnoth’s face. He seemed to have expected Adam to ask him something like that, though the number of questions took him off guard.
</p><br><p>"Gha... I don’t have much time left to answer all your questions... But, something you’ll find out pretty soon anyway, so... listen carefully."
</p><br><br><p>Lost Light clung tighter to Arnoth in complete silence. A third of her body was already gone, golden particles passing between the two men.
</p><br><p>"Me and the Crimson Monarch, we are much older than you, those serpents or other monsters at the Dead Lands. All the monsters you’ve met before... We call them monsters of the New Wave. They’re young and weak, except for some striking exceptions..."
</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, Silvana who remained along with him on the battlefield frowned. She wasn’t trying to remember the name, she knew she’d never heard that term before.
</p><br><p>It was information unavailable even to a K3-Phantom, even though they were on Heaven Island and saw the Queen.
</p><br><p>"If I were a monster, would I also be of the New Wave?" Adam asked.
</p><br><p>Arnoth nodded weakly.
</p><br><p>"Sure, it applies to Phantoms too... It’s just that, most of you who fight against monsters don’t even know that they are the New Wave monsters. Only a small fraction of you fight monsters that live in this world long enough... The strongest of you."
</p><br><p>"What about you and the Crimson Monarch? If you’re not of the New Wave, where do you belong? And... What does that even mean?"
</p><br><p>Arnoth chuckled briefly. "Hahah, so many questions... If you’re wondering, I and the Crimson Monarch are monsters of the Hollow Wave. About the black flashes... They come from the Dark Shore..."
</p><br><p>Again and again, Arnoth talked about things Adam and Silvana had never heard of before. They were frightened by how many important subjects they didn’t know, how many secrets the government had to the common man or even K0-Phantom.
</p><br><br><p>Arnoth grabbed Adam’s wrist, or rather, squeezed lightly, he didn’t have much strength left.
</p><br><p>"I did not believe in your victory, Adam, but you made it, and you will continue your path from here on. You are strong, soon you will be even stronger, and... you will meet opponents far more intimidating than me."
</p><br><p>Seriousness covered Adam’s face. He felt that Arnoth’s next words would be his last. His heart beat slowly and from Lost Light only remained only her upper body.
</p><br><p>"How intimidating? Are they stronger than you?"
</p><br><p>"Hahaha... Sure, much stronger."
</p><br><p>Arnoth took a deep breath before gazing intently into Adam’s eyes one last time.
</p><br><p>"If you ever face any of the Lords on your journey, run Adam, run... They won’t leave you a chance. In front of them, me, or even the Crimson Monarch, is nothing..."
</p><br><p>Adam’s mouth dropped open as he wanted to ask something else, but at the last moment, he froze - Arnoth’s breath stopped.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>Space shuddered as Arnoth and Lost Light’s bodies shone brightly. Golden light ran along their frames, light cracks spreading with wild speed.
</p><br><p>Silvana hugged him tightly, watching the energy movements intently.
</p><br><p>"Prepare yourself. This is an important moment."
</p><br><p>"Sure, all this power should only go to one being."
</p><br><p>In a single burst, Arnoth and Lost Light’s bodies shattered into a myriad of bright fragments that rushed upward, condensing into a sphere.
</p><br><br><br><p>Without warning, Adam appeared in his inner space, appearing in front of his Initial Gene.
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze didn’t have time to say anything when Adam grabbed Moira’s wrist tightly. It only became more difficult for her after he opened his final gate. The powerful pressure prevented her from breathing freely.
</p><br><p>"What?! What are you doing?!" Moira exclaimed, but Adam answered nothing.
</p><br><p>In a sharp sweep of his arm, he pulled Moira outward.
</p><br><p>She gasped. It was painful for her to be outside of Initial Gene.
</p><br><p>"Don’t worry, it’ll be over soon. I don’t know what will happen next to you, but hopefully, you’ll find your way," Adam whispered before gently pushing her chest.
</p><br><p>Moira couldn’t resist.
</p><br><p>The impact drove her aside, knocking her out of Adam’s inner space.
</p><br><p>She plunged into darkness as a purple star flew out of Adam.
</p><br><p>The next thing she saw was a golden orb, the space around it breaking, letting in the distant darkness.
</p><br><p>It was time for Moira to go home. Alone this time.</p>
