            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1414: Solar Form</strong></p><br><p>Several precise attacks and powerful abilities forced Anelez to resort to extreme measures. She wasn’t ready to lose, not so quickly.</p><br><p>If she gave up now, she would achieve nothing. Neither she nor Adam would be able to make any progress in the battle, and this failure would be entirely her fault.</p><br><p>Well, maybe their fight would end quickly, but that definitely wasn’t going to happen now, and there was only one reason for that — Anelez hadn’t used the Solar Form yet. Since she had not yet reached the Lord Level, her Solar Form was far from as powerful as someone like Xander, but nevertheless, it was her strongest weapon and trump card.</p><br><p>Until a monster reached the Lord Level, it did not have its own weapon; only the Lords received the Arc, which, to some extent, was a counterpart to the Nexus of the Phantoms.</p><br><p>The Solar Form was different. The Hybrids did not need weapons, as they themselves were weapons.</p><br><br><p>A stream of flame shot out in all directions as Adam dropped to the ground, waiting to see Anelez’s new form.</p><br><p>With the next gust of wind, his eyes widened.</p><br><p>Anelez’s crimson hair was shorter, burning with scarlet fire. Her hands and feet were covered with gloves and boots made of durable material, protected by shiny red scales like a dragon’s. Her upper body was protected by a light, flexible chestplate with an amber eye in the center.</p><br><p>But her armor was not as important as her trembling muscles and bulging veins. Her eyes fixed on Adam as her only target while her aura billowed in all directions like a wild sun.</p><br><p>Adam had mixed feelings. He had never seen anything like this before, but for some reason, he was disappointed.</p><br><p>‘Wait. Is that all?’ He thought as his gaze swept over Anelez’s armor and her intense stare. ‘It’s as if the monster has returned to its human form and nothing more.’</p><br><p>He continued to ponder, his mind racing with thoughts about Anelez and her trump card. But…</p><br><p>“ADAM!” Silvana’s voice rang out in his mind, forcing him to look ahead.</p><br><p>Anelez was already right in front of him, a trail of flames left behind her after her swift leap. It all happened too fast for Adam to comprehend.</p><br><p>Then, he raised his sword in an attempt to block her attack. Like Anelez earlier, he acted on instinct, realizing that this was his only chance to survive.</p><br><br><p>Anelez’s claws touched Adam’s sword, sending a single fiery circle outward.</p><br><p>Although Anelez said nothing, Adam understood perfectly well what was about to happen. He felt the shockwave approaching, surpassing anything he had ever seen before.</p><br><br><p>The impact threw Adam aside, sending him flying dozens of meters like a cannonball. Unlike Anelez, who had found herself in a similar situation at the beginning of the fight, Adam had no option but to rely on his instincts to do all the work for him.</p><br><p>He had to think about how to regain his balance, so he gripped his sword tightly, deciding to plunge it into the ground to slow himself down.</p><br><p>Suddenly, Adam felt something grab his wrist. His hand trembled as he tried to lower his sword, but he couldn’t do it.</p><br><br><p>Adam turned around only to see Anelez’s gray eyes now burning with fire and focused solely on him.</p><br><p>‘What?! She overtook me while I was in midair from her own hit?!’</p><br><p>The realization hit Adam as he noticed that Anelez’s one hand was holding his wrist and the other was on his shoulder.</p><br><p>At the same moment, she opened her mouth wide, reminding Adam that she was not a warrior, but a beast whose fangs were a formidable weapon in themselves.</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes filled with panic, but before he could do anything, Anelez’s jaws closed around his left shoulder.</p><br><br><p>A painful groan escaped Adam’s throat as Anelez’s fangs sank deep into his flesh.</p><br><p>Anelez’s bite was strong enough to easily clench her long fists inside Adam’s shoulder. If Adam hadn’t been her equal in strength and hadn’t possessed such a strong body, Anelez would have torn his shoulder off, flesh and bones and all, with that bite.</p><br><p>“FUUUUCK!” Adam roared before flapping his wings and flying high into the air.</p><br><p>Anelez wasn’t going to back down just because of that; her jaw was also clenched tightly in an attempt to inflict as much damage on Adam as possible.</p><br><br><p>Gathering all his strength in one point, Adam swung his sword, preparing to unleash the power of his dark thunder on Anelez.</p><br><br><p>As soon as she sensed the threat, Anelez moved away from Adam. She just loosened her grip and fell, still staring at him intently.</p><br><p>She showed no arrogance or haughty calm. No, from the moment she used the Solar Form, she did not take her eyes off him. She demonstrated that he was her target, that he was now her prey, and that she would not stop until she got what she wanted.</p><br><p>This painful and rather gentle exchange of blows allowed Adam to understand the true power of the Solar Form.</p><br><p>‘I see…’ He sighed heavily, clutching his bloodied shoulder. ‘It’s not about energy, weapons, or armor. The basis is her incredible physical power, her speed and strength are now beyond my comprehension. But the crucial thing is how she looks at me. Like a fierce wolf at a cowardly rat.’</p><br><p>Adam shook his head as Anelez landed nimbly on the ground.</p><br><p>Many of his plans had been ruined. It was now clear to him that most of his attacks would simply not work against the current Anelez. At least not until he was several steps below her.</p><br><p>“In that case, I must also use one of my trump cards, mustn’t I?” He muttered while their eyes stared intently at each other.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Dual Demon Sword vanished as five crimson rings bound by chains appeared in its place.</p><br><p>‘That wasn’t enough against the Silver Weaver, but…’ Adam’s gaze grew colder. ‘What about you?’</p>
