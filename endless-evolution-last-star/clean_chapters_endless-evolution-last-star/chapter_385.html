            <br><p>The fighter was approaching the Citadel, eager to bring home three Phantoms and one Hybrid, along with their fallen mates.</p><br><p>Some were enjoying the view as they flew over the various territories on their way to the Citadel, some were more interested in observing the unusual mechanisms that made the XH-01 so special, and some seemed to be just getting good sleep and rest.</p><br><p>But, if Katrin and Osana were doing their things, Adam wasn't sleeping at all, though... his body wasn't moving, his heart was beating slowly, and his mind wasn't in the inner space.</p><br><p>Adam didn't know where he was or what was going on, but he hadn't tried to find answers to those questions for a long time, as all his thoughts were occupied with accepting the new truth: He was weak.</p><br><p>It wasn't some crazy idea that came to Adam when he once again lost a fight against the Plague Reaper in this strange place. Moreover, Plague Reaper was already dead...</p><br><p>However, each fight, even if Adam lost in just a few seconds, created a new memory, allowing Evolution Tree to have an experience where a new impulse traveled through its great trunk.</p><br><p>Adam couldn't tell if this Plague Reaper had all the capabilities of the original, or if the copy only did what Adam saw during the battle in the flame ring.</p><br><p>In the first option, it meant that Plague Reaper could do new unique moves or even abilities that he didn't use in Fume Cathedral for some reason. In the second option, it meant that Plague Reaper's power was limited by Adam's knowledge of his opponent.</p><br><p>However, there was no way Adam could feel the difference. They were only using their most basic abilities, the fight just didn't have time to get to anything more complex, Adam was losing too quickly.</p><br><p>There was no way to tell which option was correct from simple physical attacks. Plague Reaper could move freely, striking from any angle and with any part of his body.</p><br><p>Well, not that this pondering made any sense at the moment, as something else was important to Adam.</p><br><p>"No way... Even despite everything I've been through, I'm actually still a weakling..." Adam muttered while a shiver went through his entire body.</p><br><p>He wasn't panicking, it was just a fact he should accept.</p><br><p>Then, fighting against Plague Reaper and constantly losing, Adam realized that in most fights his victories were not fair to his opponents.</p><br><p>He killed his first monster, Silver Weaver, only because Phantom had died before him, giving Adam a weapon, and Silver Weaver was weakened for various reasons.</p><br><p>Prime Stone Goliath, Adam was only able to kill this monster because he entered Resonance for the first time.</p><br><p>Brass Puppet - was a fair 1 vs. 1, but... it couldn't be otherwise since it was his Initial Monster, Adam had to defeat it to reveal his Lock from the chains.</p><br><p>Then, one of the notable opponents was Steel Knight. Sure, there was no one extra in their fight, but Adam was greatly helped by Zera's ability. In fact, this was the first time he got a boost from another Phantom's ability.</p><br><p>During Eclipse, while defending Bastion Radon, Adam teamed up with other strong Phantoms, and in the end, he and Alexia destroyed everything in their way, but they did it together with the other's help.</p><br><p>In Fall Hill Prison, the final battle against Prago was fought in alliance with Kayla and Edir, 3 vs. 1. Sure, it wasn't an easy fight, and maybe it was even fair, but it still wasn't a clean battle.</p><br><p>Essence Thunder Demon... Well, Adam was the one who killed this monster, but if it wasn't for Fred covering him with his arrows and help from many other Phantoms, Adam surely would've died.</p><br><p>His last significant opponent was none other than Plague Reaper and it was the most unfair fight Adam had ever been in.</p><br><p>There were six Phantoms, each with a wealth of combat experience, several of the supports knowing their jobs. As an add-on, they were later joined by Nessa, the only Hybrid possessing frightening power for her level.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper was alone. No one helped him, on the contrary, the other monsters got in his way when Midnight Crystal appeared.</p><br><p>Yeah, in the end, Plague Reaper lost, but he killed three Phantoms, dozens of monsters and hurt everyone else badly. Adam, Nessa, Katrin, and Osana had to use everything they had, every ability, every trump card to earn this victory.</p><br><p>Adam could hold off Plague Reaper and fight against him on equal terms, but... why wasn't he capable of doing that now in this strange space?</p><br><p>Well, he wasn't carrying reinforcements from Katrin, Lero, and Osana, nor was he in Resonance. Moreover, this copy of the Plague Reaper was at the peak of his powers, not injured or exhausted.</p><br><p>All of this resulted in a horrible difference in strength that was just a reflection of reality.</p><br><br><p>Adam attacked once more, but before he could realize anything, Plague Reaper knocked him to the ground and blasted his head with a powerful stomp.</p><br><p>"Hah... This is all kind of even sad... I'm sure at the moment I'm considered one of the strongest K1-Phantoms, but... without the help of others, I wouldn't be able to defeat almost any of you..." Adam muttered remembering all of his opponents.</p><br><p>He didn't know what he was supposed to feel, at the same time it was hard for him to accept it, but it was also his motivation making the flame in his eyes burn brighter. Find adventures on empire</p><br><br><p>Pulses passed through Evolution Tree time after time until a calm voice came from outside.</p><br><p>"Adam, wake up, we're almost there." Osana said quietly, touching his shoulder.</p><br><br><p>Adam sighed, slowly opening his eyes.</p><br><br><p>The fighter stopped, descending to a wide area cleared specifically for the XH-01.</p><br><p>Several military squads with medics were already waiting for them, looking in amazement at the unique fighter that was being used for the first time for combat duties.</p><br><p>The ramp dropped, allowing the Phantoms to exit.</p><br><br><p>Katrin with a confident smirk on her face was ahead, she liked the fact that all eyes were on her. It was attention she craved.</p><br><p>She was immediately approached by a middle-aged woman in a black military uniform.</p><br><p>Katrin put her hand to her side, looking at the woman who was ready to introduce herself. It was clearly someone important.</p><br><p>"Glad to have you back alive. I'm the captain of this unit, my name is..."</p><br><p>She was about to introduce herself, but before she could say anything, she froze in place and her eyes went wide.</p><br><p>A shiver ran through her body at the sight of a thick black aura appearing behind Katrin, as if it were the coming of death itself. It became difficult for the woman to breathe.</p><br><p>But... this strange aura wasn't coming from Katrin, she didn't even notice anything.</p><br><p>Then, everything disappeared in an instant, when behind Katrin appeared Adam, who clumsily walked forward.</p><br><p>He passed like a shadow, ready to disperse at any moment, which was strange since he should get some vigor and strength after a short sleep.</p><br><p>'Hmm? Has his gait changed?' Osana raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>"Wait! Stop! We have to treat your wounds!" One of the doctors said worriedly, approaching Adam.</p><br><p>"No... Later, now I have to create a key..." Adam wheezed before falling to the ground.</p><br><p>At this time, the night ended, allowing the sun to rise above the horizon line.</p><br><p>The first rays fell on Adam, casting a long shadow to the side.</p>
