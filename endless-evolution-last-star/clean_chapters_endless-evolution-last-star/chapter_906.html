            <br><p>Two days had passed since Erik's demonstration of the use of the Infusive Energy Control, practically, because now it was the evening of the fifth day.</p><br><p>Unlike last time, now neither Adam nor Reinz could quickly master the last type of Energy Control. None of them had succeeded.</p><br><p>Erik showed them how to use the Infusive Energy Control only once, and then he left them alone. He thought he demonstrated enough - all they had to do was to master the third type in the remaining time.</p><br><p>No one thought it would be easy, but Adam and Reinz were confident that they would do it in time.</p><br><br><p>Reinz's energy turned into electrical discharges covering his arms with gauntlets and his feet with tall boots woven from lightning. Like Adam's needle, it was his main ability that he used most often.</p><br><p>Time after time, Reinz tried to influence his ability with energy, to somehow alter or enhance the gauntlets, but he found only failure.</p><br><p>He wasn't about to give up, though. There was a look of frustration in his eyes, but it passed as quickly as it appeared.</p><br><p>"Another failure..." he muttered, glancing down at his hands.</p><br><p>"Hm... We're doing something wrong, what do you think?" Reinz glanced at Adam who stood aside so as not to disturb each other.</p><br><p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head thoughtfully, his expression complicated.</p><br><p>"I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think we have a problem with energy control, technically we're doing everything right. But, we're just missing the point. When it came to the Outer Energy Control, I knew immediately what needed to be done, but... now. It's not so obvious."</p><br><p>Then, Adam stretched his arm forward with ease creating a needle full of intense energy.</p><br><p>"Hmm..." he mumbled thoughtfully, "Maybe it's about our desires?"</p><br><p>Reinz raised an eyebrow in confusion, "Desires? You're wrong. I've tried changing my ability in every possible way, but it doesn't seem to work. Sure, maybe I didn't find what I'm looking for yet, but I doubt that in almost two days I haven't tried every option."</p><br><p>Adam didn't seem to hear Reinz, for no emotion appeared on his face.</p><br><p>He stared blankly at his needle, thinking about his idea.</p><br><p>"Well... I meant it a little differently."</p><br><p>Then, Adam turned and pointed the needle at Reinz.</p><br><p>"During a fight, you often think you're missing something, if you had what you were missing you would have won by now or at least gotten rid of the problem. I'm sure you know the feeling.</p><br><p>"What if we're not looking for what we want but what we need? It's only when you lack something that you realize what you need, isn't it?"</p><br><p>Realizing what Adam was getting at, Reinz stepped back carefully.</p><br><p>"Wait, I don't think a battle is what we should do." Reinz gulped.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam tilted his head, "Do you have any other options? We only have two days left, maybe even less if Erik demands results at the end of the week."</p><br><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam lunged forward to face Reinz. In his eyes was only one desire - to fight.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Within a second, they exchanged two high-speed attacks. Sparks flew off to the sides with each collision of the lightning claws and silver needle. The speed and strength of the strikes were enough to send shockwaves through the trembling air.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, this was their first full-fledged clash.</p><br><p>Sure, they had a fight where Adam emerged victorious, but in the first part of their fight, Adam did almost nothing. Reinz ended up doing a lot of attacks without facing any resistance from the other side.</p><br><p>Then, after the path led them to the lake, there was no time and energy for long exchanges of blows.</p><br><p>Everything ended in one final attack.</p><br><p>It was important because Reinz felt that there was a significant difference in mastery between them.</p><br><p>'Agh...? What's going on?' he internally muttered struggling to block Adam's slashes, 'I can barely keep up with his movements, but he looks relaxed!'</p><br><p>Soon, Adam's eyes became as cold as glaciers.</p><br><p>"I see, you're really going to need the Void Lake, or you won't catch up with me."</p><br><p>Reinz's eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam's foot plunged into his stomach. Reinz gasped, his pupils fluttering with pain, but no sooner had he recovered than Adam's knee crashed into his nose.</p><br><p>It didn't break him. Reinz stepped back quickly, but Adam was already in front of him. Their exchange of strikes continued, but now Adam was even faster.</p><br><p>'No, this can't go on,' he gulped, assessing his position, 'My hands are shaking, soon I'll make another mistake and miss a hit. Maybe I should use my legs? No... I don't have time for that.'</p><br><br><p>Another cascade of sparks was broken by Adam's fists crashing straight into Reinz's jaw.</p><br><p>The impact threw Reinz several meters aside, causing him to roll across the ground in the dust and leaving a bloody trail behind him.</p><br><p>Before the momentum came to an end, Adam appeared in front of him, going to attack in advance.</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Reinz's body, his eyes reflecting Adam's silhouette. His hands raised, gripping the needle tightly.</p><br><p>He intended to sever Reinz in two, it seemed there was no way to stop him from doing so.</p><br><p>Could Reinz use other abilities to change the course of the fight? Sure, but that wasn't what he was thinking.</p><br><p>There was only one thing missing for him to save himself and win.</p><br><p>'Speed... I need speed...' Reinz wheezed, remembering their clashes, 'I'm strong enough, I just need to get faster!!!'</p><br><p>At the same moment, an array of energy headed towards Reinz's arms and legs, condensing on his gauntlets and boots.</p><br><br><p>Reinz turned into a lightning flash, ending up behind Adam.</p><br><p>Stunned, Adam jerked his head looking at his opponent over his shoulder.</p><br><p>Then, Reinz's foot slammed into his side, clearly breaking several ribs. Adam didn't have time to defend himself.</p><br><p>'Yes! I did it!' Reinz exclaimed inwardly, 'Now it's your turn, Adam!'</p>
