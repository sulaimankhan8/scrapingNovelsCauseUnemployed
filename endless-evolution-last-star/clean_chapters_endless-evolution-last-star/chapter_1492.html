            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1492: Search</strong></p><br><p>Beth didn’t know where Adam and Alexia could find the Blood of God and Ancient Frost. If someone else had said this, but not Beth, Adam and Alexia wouldn’t have been too worried.</p><br><p>But if even Beth didn’t know, then hardly anyone else in the world did. Despite her harmless appearance and discontented gaze, her mind contained secrets and vast amounts of information that she had collected over hundreds and hundreds of years.</p><br><p>Until Adam and Alexia went through at least a couple of World Wipes, that level of knowledge was unattainable for them.</p><br><p>“W-What?” Adam stuttered. “You don’t know how we can do it? But Alexia and I are not at the edge of the K4 Level. Many Phantoms have gone much further than us! They must have done it somehow!”</p><br><p>Beth took a sip of hot tea and nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“Think about it yourself, Adam. You’ve already fulfilled many conditions to get the First Grand Star and Second Grand Star, but…” Her sharp gaze darted to him. “Did you know from the beginning where and how to get each of the conditions?”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened for a moment.</p><br><p>The Midnight Crystal and Twilight Crystal were his easiest conditions. The Connected Heart and Dark Heart fell into the same category because, although Adam didn’t know what they were at first, when he found out, he realized that he needed to defeat certain opponents to become stronger and obtain their power.</p><br><p>However, up to that point, Adam had fulfilled not four but six conditions. The Memory Fragment and Desire of Beyond were different from all the others.</p><br><p>He obtained the Memory Fragment by accident after defeating Bathild, and for the Desire of Beyond, he had to embark on a journey and get help from the Ancient Artifact, or more precisely, from a Hollow One.</p><br><p>Although now Adam understood that the Desire of Beyond had always been with him. He just needed a little push to find the answer and his new power.</p><br><p>Now, all three conditions, the Highest Bliss, Blood of God, and Bottomless Void, fell into the same category as the Memory Fragment and Desire of Beyond.</p><br><p>Adam didn’t know where he could find even one of the conditions, but that didn’t mean it was an impossible task.</p><br><p>Maybe he needed help, or maybe he needed to understand the principle of how it worked.</p><br><p>“Wait, you’re right,” Adam muttered as he turned to Alexia. She had the same look on her face.</p><br><br><br><p>However, Silvana and Louis did not share the same opinion.</p><br><p>“Beth, but isn’t it strange that you don’t know anything at all?” Silvana asked with a slight frown. “I mean, is Adam really the first Phantom in history who has to obtain the Blood of God?”</p><br><p>Louis crossed his arms over his chest.</p><br><p>“Yeah, what about Alexia? The Ancient Frost? Are you saying there hasn’t been a single Phantom with the ice element who needed the Ancient Frost?”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Beth wasn’t going to make excuses. There was no need.</p><br><p>“Exactly. You are the first with these conditions, that’s all I can say to your question.”</p><br><br><p>For a moment, there was silence. They understood that Beth wasn’t lying, but it was also hard for them to accept that it was true. If Adam and Alexia’s conditions were unique, then their whole idea that they could get help from a more experienced Phantom was shattered by the cruel reality.</p><br><p>“But,” Beth continued. “There’s nothing unusual about that. You just don’t understand what’s going on here, but I’ll try to explain everything to you.”</p><br><p>Her eyes scanned the table as she noticed a simple red apple on a plate.</p><br><p>Beth picked up the apple, pointing to it.</p><br><p>“Let’s say a Phantom needs to obtain, let’s say, the Crimson Fire Apple to fulfill one of its conditions. Another Phantom with the same history and abilities may have the same condition, but it will be called the Blazing Fruit, for example.</p><br><p>“Moreover, not only will the names be different, but also the place where they can get this ‘apple’ and what they will ultimately find. Will it be just a fruit? Maybe a flaming lump? Or was it the title of some monster from the very beginning? Who knows?”</p><br><p>She put the apple aside.</p><br><p>“So even if some Phantoms had conditions similar to yours before, the titles were different, the place and time were different, and even the form of the necessary thing or state was different. The only thing that remains unchanged is the distant essence between these cases, but nothing more.</p><br><p>“I mean, it would be strange if a Phantom with water abilities and a corresponding path had to find something related to fire and aggression, right?”</p><br><p>No one said anything for a while. Beth’s explanations were clear and logical, but that only slightly alleviated their situation.</p><br><p>“So… In the end, regardless of whether anyone has walked our path before or not, we somehow have to figure out how to obtain the Blood of God and Ancient Frost ourselves?” Adam asked, hoping that it wasn’t actually that difficult.</p><br><p>He didn’t regret the time and effort he had spent to obtain the Desire of Beyond and the Silver Weaver, which were now an important part of his power. But to go through the same thing three more times? For each of the conditions?</p><br><p>Adam wasn’t sure he was ready for that.</p><br><p>At that moment, the corners of Beth’s lips curved upward.</p><br><p>“Well, even though neither I nor Damien nor anyone else can tell you where to go, someone can.”</p><br><p>“Hmm? Who?” Alexia asked eagerly, slapping her palms on the table. “Is it a Phantom with special abilities? Tell us his name, and we’ll find him right now!”</p><br><p>She was always ready to rush into battle at any moment.</p><br><p>Beth shook her head.</p><br><p>“That person is you.”</p><br><p>Adam and Alexia froze for a moment when a dangerous gleam flashed across Beth’s eyes.</p><br><p>“Although you may need the help of someone strong, someone ancient… How about the queen?”</p>
