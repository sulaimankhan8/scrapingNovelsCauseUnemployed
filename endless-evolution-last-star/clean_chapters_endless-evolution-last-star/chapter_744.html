            <br><p>Adam's hand twitched as he was about to engage, the monsters gradually surrounding him, forcing him to step closer to the river's edge, but Lone Blaze's voice stopped him.</p><br><p>"If you're suggesting to use the second charge of the sun seal, you'd better say so. I don't have time to deal with your cryptic lines right now!"</p><br><p>Continue your adventure at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Against one or more monsters, Adam had no doubts about victory, especially with the flaming needle, but when there were so many opponents, he feared the real possibility of being torn apart.</p><br><p>Moreover, as he looked around the crowd moving towards him, Adam noticed monsters he hadn't seen before - the Inferior Adherents.</p><br><p>In some ways, they were similar to the Shadow Walkers dwelling above, but they also shared similarities with the Vile Believers.</p><br><p>The Inferior Adherents were humanoid creatures, weak in appearance, but they had four arms protected by thick plates, old gray skin, covering their bodies in several layers.</p><br><p>Each of their hands held a sharp dagger with a curved blade, the crimson cloth overlaying their bodies obscured half of their faces from above, yet their hollow eyes remained visible from beneath the falling shadows.</p><br><p>Adam didn't waste much time on them, they didn't look strong, and after a second Silvana confirmed that.</p><br><p>Soon, when it was almost too late, Lone Blaze answered him.</p><br><p>[This is your decision. You received my power by following the terms of the Pact. If you want, you can use the full power of the sun seal now or not at all...]</p><br><p>Without wasting any time, Lone Blaze continued:</p><br><p>[But, I am your ally, and my advice would be to accept help from me. If you use your powers, you'll waste a lot of energy. I'm sure you'll need your strength for the final battle.]</p><br><p>Adam's gaze grew sterner as he took a step back.</p><br><br><p>A stone fragment fell away from the edge, disappearing into the powerful flow of the bloody river. There was nowhere else to retreat, Adam had to make a decision right now.</p><br><p>Standing in the back rows, the Vile Believers already opened their jaws, their strings were ready to attack, as well as the active vines growing from the Sacrificial Holders' backs.</p><br><p>"I take it I'm going to have to endure the hellish pain again like I'm burning from the inside out?"</p><br><p>[Yes, is that a problem for you?]</p><br><p>Adam frowned heavily, then shook his head and sighed hard, letting out a club of hot steam.</p><br><p>"Agh, you're so hard to deal with. You're my worst ally, I say that quite sincerely."</p><br><p>For some reason, Silvana's corners of her lips went up at that moment. She didn't know why, but she was pleased to see Adam voicing his displeasure about Lona Blaze.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze answered nothing, it didn't matter what Adam said, it only mattered what he did.</p><br><p>The scalding heat spread from Adam's chest again, one of the two remaining crystals flared brightly as well as his eyes.</p><br><p>Soon, amber flames appeared in his inner space as the Evolution Tree welcomed another guest, the second of three possible ones. Before the monsters could do anything, the sun shone brightly in front of the Evolution Tree, transferring its power to one of its parts.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, a bright pain filled Adam's mind, transmitting the information he needed, but now he endured it steadfastly, wanting only to fight.</p><br><p>White threads quickly covered his body, making him stronger, part of it headed towards his right eye, forming deep inside an amber grid, allowing Adam to see every movement of his enemies.</p><br><p>For a few seconds, the world slowed down, the monsters didn't understand the pain he was feeling now, nor what it meant to them.</p><br><p>Adam's lips slowly came into motion in a barely audible whisper:</p><br><p>"So... This time it's the Second Order, right?"</p><br><p>Then, a calm, red flame erupted at his feet, traveling along his threads, but unlike his needle, the fire didn't take effect on his entire Second Order, everything above his knees remained as before.</p><br><p>For a moment, a glint of disappointment appeared in Adam's gaze as his eyes lowered down, watching as two streams of flame swirled around his feet.</p><br><p>At the same time, he felt an unshakable confidence emanating from something deep inside, unlike Adam, Lone Blaze was well aware of the power his grumpy ally received.</p><br><p>"RRRRRRRGGGGGHHRRRRRR!!!"</p><br><p>Several Carnage Jaws along with Inferior Adherents, simultaneously pounced on Adam, vines, and strings rushed to the aid of the active monsters, keeping a safe distance.</p><br><p>"Well, let's see what you can do, Lone Blaze."</p><br><br><p>Adam took a step forward as fire swirls surged upwards, red particles whizzing behind his back, contrasting with his cold blue eyes.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam turned into a flash, sweeping through the monsters like a destructive torrent of flame.</p><br><p>The Carnage Jaws and Inferior Adherents didn't even realize what happened, the powerful pulse simply tore them apart.</p><br><p>Those monsters that managed to survive even though they were badly damaged were unable to do anything about it, the fire left on the ground, Adam's trail of flame quickly burning them into a pile of ash.</p><br><p>Looking around, Adam's eyes went wide for a moment, soon the cold expression returned to him. There were many more monsters nearby, but he made a simple move, he didn't even start fighting.</p><br><p>"Oh, looks like after this fight, I'll have to apologize to you."</p><br><p>[Sure, and you do it sincerely and with all the details. Otherwise, you can forget about my help in the future.]</p><br><p>Such a cheeky reply only caused Adam to smile slightly, the shadows were thickening around him, the monsters went too far to retreat.</p><br><p>Adam shook his head, directing his gaze upwards.</p><br><p>"Shut up, you have no choice but to help me. That's the whole point of the Pact. For a piece of rock, you're too talkative."</p><br><p>Then, a multitude of silhouettes pounced on Adam, completely engulfing him.</p><br><br><p>The darkness didn't last long, soon a ring of fire burned it, as well as all the monsters around it, then the Phantom wielding over the foreign flames rushed forward, right along the massive river, destroying any creature in his path.</p><br><p>With every step Adam took, more monsters died, and there was no end to it.</p>
