            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1287: Fury Flower (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Adam’s opponents were different, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that Arnoth and the Crimson Monarch were too majestic for his level, no, for his age at the time and even now.</p><br><p>Adam’s closest opponent in spirit was Fromund. They were very similar, not only because they were both Phantoms or humans, which played the smallest role among all the others.</p><br><p>The most important factors were their temperament and age.</p><br><p>Whether Adam wanted it or not, most monsters and even Phantoms of his level were much older, by tens and sometimes hundreds of years.</p><br><p>However, even though Fromund was an excellent opponent, it was not what Adam wanted at that time, and especially now.</p><br><p>They fought in the arena, under the gaze of hundreds of nobles who placed bets and wanted to earn as much as possible. Some succeeded, while others lost everything they had.</p><br><p>Now, Adam had the opportunity to get what he had never had before.</p><br><p>A fight against someone who was very similar to him, at least in terms of their goals, even if Ureyn was more patient than Adam and decided to wait for better times. Well, unlike Adam, he had nothing to worry about, because neither for him nor for Nollura was the World Wipe a big problem.</p><br><p>“So, what are we going to do?” Adam turned to Nollura.</p><br><p>Nollura stepped forward, her gaze sweeping over the great mill before her.</p><br><p>“I’ll try to get him to come out. I don’t want to disturb him, but it seems none of us have a choice anymore.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded as Nollura took action.</p><br><p>It wasn’t just that Adam needed the Connected Heart; if Nollura really wanted to, she could try to somehow prevent the String Duel so that Ureyn wouldn’t have to leave his mill.</p><br><p>But… now that the Black Cut and Norax himself were involved, no one had any choice but to hold the String Duel in all its glory.</p><br><p>Norax did not take no for an answer, not after he himself had become a participant in this event.</p><br><br><p>Nollura cautiously approached Ureyn’s mill, which was not much different from many other gray mills, except for the great tree twisted around it like an ancient serpent at the tower.</p><br><p>Ureyn’s gate did not have a system as complex as Gareyna’s, nor did it have subordinates in the form of moths or other monsters inhabiting the Forgotten Mills.</p><br><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p><br><p>First, Nollura knocked on the door several times, hoping for some kind of reaction from the other side.</p><br><p>Like Gareyna, if he wanted to, Ureyn could sense that someone had come to his mill. Whether he did so or not depended on what he was doing and where he was.</p><br><p>Many in this area had spacious underground levels beneath their mills. Some used this space for practice or meditation, others for conducting experiments or simply sleeping in peace. Everyone had their own reasons.</p><br><p>Several minutes passed, but there was no response.</p><br><p>Nollura bit her lip—she knew that simply knocking on the gate would not be enough. It was too naive of her to hope for that, but deep down, she wanted Ureyn to come out right now just because he sensed her aura.</p><br><p>“Shit, Ureyn, you bastard! Can’t you see I’m here?!”</p><br><p>Then, she clenched her fists tightly and slammed them into the gate with all her might.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A tremor ran through the great mill, causing the tree to shake. Nollura didn’t stop after a couple of blows, continuing her barrage of attacks.</p><br><p>However… even now, Ureyn had not decided to show himself.</p><br><br><p>Nollura fell to her knees as her palms rested on the gate.</p><br><p>Suddenly, someone’s hand fell on her shoulder, causing her to turn around.</p><br><br><p>Adam shook his head.</p><br><p>“Let’s be honest, we both knew it wouldn’t work. And… for some reason, I feel like my original plan was doomed to fail too.”</p><br><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><br><p>In response, Adam ran his fingers along his neck.</p><br><p>“Well, have you already forgotten that I came to your nest to cut off your head and come here? Ureyn isn’t reacting to anything. I don’t feel any signs of an aura coming from inside…”</p><br><br><p>At that moment, Adam touched the gate and closed his eyes. He concentrated all his strength to detect Ureyn’s aura, searching in all directions.</p><br><p>However… instead of noticing any particles, flames, or light sources, Adam saw only darkness and nothing else.</p><br><p>“Hmm, it’s as if his mill is surrounded by some kind of barrier. Shit, Nollura, Gareyna wanted me to kill you just like that. That wouldn’t have helped me lure Ureyn out of his mill. Most likely, he can’t sense our auras as well.”</p><br><p>Nollura’s eyes widened in terror when she realized that Adam was right.</p><br><p>Gareyna had wanted to do this for a long time, and now that Adam had appeared, she had the opportunity. She was definitely angry about how things had turned out, and Norax was to blame for all of it.</p><br><p>Why couldn’t Gareyna kill Nollura herself?</p><br><p>Well, she would have had big problems with the Black Cut if she had done so. Someone like her had no reason to attack Nollura, who was too weak to pose a threat even to Adam, let alone a Lord.</p><br><p>Also, sooner or later, Ureyn would find out about it and hate Gareyna. It would ruin all her plans, although… Norax had already done that, without Nollura’s death.</p><br><p>“Bitch!” Nollura exclaimed, slamming her fist into the ground.</p><br><br><p>For some reason, Nollura got goosebumps as her pupils narrowed when she looked ahead.</p><br><p>“If I were you, I’d watch what I say, worm!”</p><br><p>A stern, feminine voice rang out from behind, causing Adam to turn around and meet Gareyna’s gaze.</p><br><p>“You… What are you doing here?” Adam asked.</p><br><p>“Pfffft, isn’t it obvious? Correcting mistakes!” Gareyna exclaimed and summoned a stream of threads that headed toward them.</p><br><p>Adam and Nollura couldn’t defend themselves.</p><br><p>Luckily for them, a man in a black coat was heading straight for the gray mill in the distance. He was clearly in high spirits.</p>
