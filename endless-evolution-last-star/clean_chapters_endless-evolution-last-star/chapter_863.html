            <br><p>In a leisurely stride, Adam moved towards the Amber Cloud, his hands were in his pockets, showing all his indifference.</p><br><p>For a moment, Giselle's eyebrow twitched. She was afraid Adam would give up, it would be a disgrace to her, but it was too late to call off the fight.</p><br><br><p>Under the stares of the crowd, Adam stopped, looking at Giselle.</p><br><p>Silvana touched his shoulder in support and quickly stepped aside. For some reason, she moved much farther away than she should have for the average viewer.</p><br><p>Then, the blond-haired man took a confident step forward, guiding his hand from Adam to Giselle.</p><br><p>"Ladies and gentlemen. I, observer No. 3, am pleased to be present at this fight, possibly the last one for Ms. Giselle."</p><br><p>They both knew what to do, so soon the man had one twilight coin each.</p><br><p>A gleam passed across his devious green eyes, grinning at the two coins in his hands.</p><br><p>"Good," he nodded deeply, hiding the coins behind his back.</p><br><p>Then, with an arrogantly raised chin, observer No. 3, announced:</p><br><p>"Ms. Giselle Hurxo has four coins, and Mr. Adam VInter has only two coins. One of them is one step away from victory, while the other risks coming dangerously close to the fail."</p><br><p>The corners of his mouth went upward, in a sly grin.</p><br><p>"But... Will his defeat happen? That's what we'll find out very soon!"</p><br><p>With a quick swing, a matchbox appeared in his hand. He deftly pulled out a match and lit the tip with a sharp movement.</p><br><p>"Prepare for battle," he declared, "As soon as the fire goes out, that will mean the start of the fight. It could happen at any moment."</p><br><p>Silence fell upon the Amber Cloud. The whispers of the crowd died down, even the cooks in the kitchen seemed to stop their work.</p><br><p>Only the sound of a rapier cutting through the cold wind currents could be heard. Giselle leaned her torso forward, holding her weapon firmly by the hilt.</p><br><p>Unlike her, Adam began to slowly jump in place, like a boxer wanting to warm up before sparring.</p><br><br><p>His feet only slightly lifted off the ground before touching down with the tip of his feet, returning to the bounce.</p><br><p>With each second, Adam was getting faster while the air flow rippled his clothes, the edges of his black shirt and white T-shirt shook, the tips of his black hair rising and falling in front of his blue eyes.</p><br><p>Giselle glanced at the blond-haired man, staring intently at the burning match that was only about 2/3 full.</p><br><p>Then, she turned back to Adam.</p><br><p>'The match is burning for quite a long time. It's been ten seconds, I've still got at least that long. Well, this is a good opportunity to anticipate his first attack.'</p><br><br><p>'I wonder... After ten seconds, Adam Vinter, what will you do?'</p><br><p>A wide grin appeared on the calm face, as the observer No. 3, without warning blew out the match.</p><br><p>The flame went out and that could mean only one thing.</p><br><br><p>Adam's frame shuddered, and his silhouette disappeared.</p><br><p>Giselle's eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><br><p>At the tearing wind currents, Adam appeared in front of her, his fist moving straight for her face.</p><br><p>Pushing all thoughts away, Giselle went into combat mode as fast as she could.</p><br><p>At the last moment, she thrust her rapier in front of her, blocking Adam's strike.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>With a thud, Adam's fist slammed into the rapier's blade.</p><br><p>The next instant, Giselle's eyes darted downward, Adam's right leg already aiming for her side in a wide slice.</p><br><p>Driven by instinct, Giselle stepped back, intending to attack immediately after Adam's blow failed to reach its target.</p><br><p>But... only fear was reflected on Giselle's face, for she realized too late that she didn't move.</p><br><p>Lowering her gaze she saw that Adam's shoe was pressing her foot firmly to the ground.</p><br><br><p>At the next heartbeat, Adam's leg slammed into her side, the shockwave accompanied by a loud crunch from Giselle's bones struggling not to break under the pressure.</p><br><p>The impact threw Giselle aside.</p><br><p>Although the start of the fight was not in her favor, it was not the first time she had found herself in a difficult situation.</p><br><p>Giselle was an experienced fighter, so she knew what to do in such a case.</p><br><p>She quickly did a somersault in the air as her feet touched the ground.</p><br><br><p>As soon as she looked up to see her opponent, Adam's hand fell on her face, clutching her head tightly.</p><br><p>Through the gaps between his fingers, Giselle saw his cold face, her reflection in his cruel eyes.</p><br><p>Adam leaped forward, the marble floor cracking from his touch as he rammed everything in his path, holding Giselle in front of him like a puppet.</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crackle.</p><br><p>The tables of the luxurious restaurant shattered into splinters against her back, expensive wines flying aside along with crystal glasses and shocked nobles.</p><br><p>Only a few seconds had passed since the fight had begun, but Adam had already gone outside the arena, destroying part of the restaurant.</p><br><p>No one and nothing could stop him, even when they approached the kitchen.</p><br><p>Screams erupted from the horrified crowd:</p><br><p>"Fuck! What's going on?!"</p><br><p>"I don't know... He's just crazy!"</p><br><p>"Holy shit! Why is Giselle letting him do this!!!?"</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam and Giselle crashed into the wall, making their way into the kitchen in one burst.</p><br><p>The cooks met them with pale faces, trying to escape the epicenter.</p><br><p>The red-hot oil splashed with a mighty surge, reflecting the bright light. Knives and cutlery flew apart, a gleam running down the wide blades.</p><br><p>Then, with cracks growing and rumbling, Adam threw Giselle outside the restaurant, once again thrusting her body through the wall.</p><br><p>Slamming into the floor, rolling across the surface in painful collisions, after dozens of meters, Giselle finally stopped in the middle of the hallway.</p><br><p>The massive chandelier made of hundreds of amber crystals shuddered slightly, swaying slowly from side to side, pointing to Giselle lying on the cold marble.</p><br><br><p>A stream of blood rushed from Giselle's mouth as her fist slammed into the floor. With a pained gasp, she stood up, her legs trembling slightly.</p><br><p>Under heavy breaths, she stared at Adam, his silhouette emerging from a cloud of dust, passing through the ruined wall of the restaurant.</p><br><p>Dozens of gazes were focused on their fight, their eyes wide open full of disbelief.</p><br><p>Keeping his perpetual smirk, observer no. 3, muttered:</p><br><p>"Well, well. It seems that neither Ms. Giselle nor our dear spectators expected this turn of events."</p><br><p>Then, the blonde-haired man turned around, as if by chance glancing specifically at Silvana.</p><br><p>"It looks like his word can be trusted. He keeps his pledge."</p><br><p>Silvana flinched, she gulped trying to figure out how the man knew this.</p><br><p>But, he didn't torture her and gave her the answer right away.</p><br><p>"Oh, no need to guess," the man smiled sweetly, "I'm one of three special observers. You might say we have a little more access than the rest of us."</p><br><p>Still, Silvana was left confused. She knew too little about this place to fully understand.</p><br><br><p>The man only chuckled weakly, returning his gaze to the battle.</p><br><p>"Well, not as much as Mr. Andreas, but it's hard to hide anything from us. It's not that important, though, right? I'm sure you're as eager as I am to see a decent fight."</p><br><p>With uncertainty, Silvana stepped closer to the observer, standing a few steps away from him.</p><br><p>"Sure... Every spectator has that desire."</p><br><p>Silvana wanted to say something else, but watching Adam, at his confident stride and steadfastness, something inside her changed.</p><br><p>A barely noticeable gleam ran across her green eyes, carrying with it a blue tint that immediately disappeared.</p><br><p>Suddenly, her expression became different, a cruel smirk reflected on her face.</p><br><p>"Hah... I hate to say it, but seeing Adam like this is pure pleasure. Giselle was so sure of her victory, but she couldn't even react in time to your fire trick."</p><br><p>Silvana didn't realize what was happening to her, a strange feeling flooded her chest.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, observer no. 3, had an answer, especially for her.</p><br><p>"Well, well, I see you're not trying to hide your emotions. I'm sure it's always nice to have someone who swears on your life, fighting for you at full strength."</p><br><p>Wearing a smirk, the man glanced at Silvana over his shoulder.</p><br><p>"Relief, right? You've seen once again how much you mean to Adam, Silvana Desio."</p><br><p>Silvana didn't know what to say.</p><br><p>The observer no. 3, didn't just read her mind, it seemed that he could see even what she didn't know yet, her fears and desires.</p><br><p>There was no magic in it.</p><br><p>Just the experience of a grown man who was well versed in people, in relationships, and especially in the Phantoms he had to work with.</p><br><p>At the same time, a frosty mist rose from the ground, enveloping Giselle like an honorable guardian.</p><br><p>With the back of her palm, she wiped away the last trickle of blood, aiming her rapier at Adam, who stood carelessly in the distance.</p><br><br><br><p>"The observer's trick took me by surprise. You used all your power so abruptly and aggressively. However..."</p><br><p>She stood up, energy rushing powerfully through her body.</p><br><p>"Now it's time for a real fight."</p><br><p>In response, Adam only nodded slightly.</p><br><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A shiver ran through his Initial Gene, the two entities lurking at the very center of his power grinning predatorily. Soon, it would be their turn to act.</p>
