            <br><p>Snow Follower's main goal was to satisfy his interest, for that, he was willing to give Nessa time to get stronger, and even during the fight, he was not in a hurry to show his full strength.</p><br><p>Snow Follower acted slowly, allowing Nessa to adapt to his abilities and movements, however... it wasn't enough to close the real gap in their power.</p><br><p>The outcome was predictable - a wide gash across Nessa's chest, and only her sturdy body separated her from death.</p><br><p>Nessa's mind filled with the realization that she lost again, that once more it was Snow Follower and all gone at the true humiliation from the monster.</p><br><p>Nessa tried not to show it, but since she knew that she was stronger than all the humans and K0-Phantoms, as well as being the only hybrid, made her arrogant. There was pride inside her, as Nessa realized that she was better than the others.</p><br><p>However... none of that meant anything if she couldn't prove her superiority. First, she did so by defeating her first monster, then defeating the first Blue Threat monster, which put her above K0-level.</p><br><p>She wanted to defeat Snow Follower, but he just beat her up. One swing of his katana was enough to bring her close to the limit.</p><br><p>But... the one who knew her best, Magnus, wasn't worried at all. He knew that this was the only way Nessa could make the leap in her power.</p><br><p>'No way...' Nessa muttered inwardly while her scarlet hair rippled slightly in the flow of wind from Snow Follower's katana.</p><br><p>Nessa's gaze shifted to the drops of blood slowly flying before her eyes.</p><br><p>In the reflection, she saw not the perfect human and first hybrid, but a simple girl ready to lose the battle again. She looked weak, wounded, and defenseless.</p><br><p>'No... Is this really me? No... This past will never come back... I am no longer a weak girl trying to survive every day... I am the perfection and I will prove it!'</p><br><p>Then, Nessa's heart began to beat faster, her blood literally boiled with excitement, and her eyes filled with blood, her veins quivered but remained calm.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Nessa's nails ripped through the snow streams, she freed her legs and arm before tearing forward.</p><br><p>For the first time in the fight, Snow Follower's eyes went wide, for he had no time to react to Nessa's actions.</p><br><p>All the monster saw was Nessa's shadow and the dozen flashes that were Nessa's fists.</p><br><p>Snow Follower swung his arm, trying to defend himself with snow streams. Two of them, came out of his katana, covering Snow Follower's chest with a dense layer of snow filled with his energy. Adam's strike probably wouldn't have been able to pierce them, only his needle.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, many holes appeared in the snow barrier, tearing the white veil apart like a thin cloth.</p><br><p>Then, Nessa's fists reached Snow Follower, smashing into his chest, stomach, and face.</p><br><p>The sounds of the blows echoed around him, bouncing off the walls and back again, constantly reinforcing the effect.</p><br><p>It seemed like just a little more and Snow Follower would be left with nothing to survive. Nessa was hitting as fast as she could. Her teeth were clenched tightly, her muscles tensed to the limit as if ready to tear from the strain, and in her eyes was nothing but rage and killing intent.</p><br><p>"I will make you regret your arrogance!" Nessa's voice boomed, consuming Snow Follower's mind.</p><br><p>Then, Nessa turned around, brought her arm up for an attack, and with all her might unleashed her fist right into Snow Follower's face.</p><br><p>The power of her attack was enough to destroy all the snow around her and throw Snow Follower aside, literally smashing him into the wall.</p><br><p>A loud rumble filled the entire hall, causing even the surface to shake, throwing the scientists and workers on the upper floors into puzzlement.</p><br><p>"Good..." Magnus chuckled contentedly, "Just what I needed. I haven't seen such strong blows from her yet. Nessa is actually growing right before my eyes."</p><br><p>"Unbelievable. Nessa is doing great!" Silvana said cheerfully. Seeing Nessa finally strike back was inspiring to her.</p><br><p>Then, Magnus turned to Adam.</p><br><p>"What do you think?"</p><br><p>However, instead of praise from Adam, Magnus only saw his intense, even indignant gaze directed at Snow Follower.</p><br><p>"Why...? Why didn't she just kill him right now?" Adam's quiet voice filled the room, silencing both Silvana and Magnus.</p><br><p>"Shit... She should have torn his head off, broken his neck, ripped out his legs, or stabbed him through the heart... At least one of those would have ended the fight by now, but instead, she's just giving him time to realize what's happening..."</p><br><p>Adam slowly turned to Nessa.</p><br><p>"I see... Now I see what the problem is. Even in nine years, she still hasn't learned how to control her power."</p><br><p>Magnus's eyes went wide. In his opinion, Nessa was handling it perfectly, but... it was obvious that Adam considered it a failure.</p><br><p>'Tsk. He's just an arrogant bastard.' Magnus inwardly muttered with a wave of his hand, 'Even if his words make sense, it doesn't change anything. Nessa will end the fight for the next series of punches and that's it.'</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Snow Follower was climbing out of the rubble, slowly pulling his body out of the wall. His entire body was covered in blood, his snow-white hair had turned partially scarlet, and his white cloak had become smaller as if wishing it were closer to his body.</p><br><br><p>Snow Follower slowly stepped forward without raising his gaze, while all the snow was heading towards his katana, whose white blade shone brightly like a lightsaber.</p><br><p>"Hah, attack. I'm not afraid of you anymore." Nessa arrogantly said, full of confidence in her abilities.</p><br><p>She didn't notice her feelings, her instincts told her something was wrong.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Snow Follower's cloak shuddered, disappearing in a blast of snow that, along with the cold vapor, completely hid his silhouette.</p><br><p>Nessa's pupils went wide as a snow vortex appeared in front of her, from which a sharp white blade emerged.</p><br><p>'I have to dodge!' Nessa exclaimed as goosebumps covered her entire body as she quickly bounced to the side.</p><br><p>But... a long cut had already shown up on her arm.</p><br><p>Then, the vortex partially dissipated, she saw Snow Follower's fist, covered in white energy that plunged into her stomach.</p><br><p>The single blow, made Nessa's eyes go wide, and caused an energy blast that traveled through Nessa's body leaving her back in the form of a snow-white burst with snow particles.</p><br><p>The next thing Nessa saw was the Snow Follower's foot coming from the left directly into her face and nailing her to the wall.</p><br><br><p>Nothing could be heard besides Snow Follower's footsteps.</p><br><p>"Nessa! Get up!" Magnus exclaimed in an anxious voice.</p><br><p>However... Nessa didn't have the strength for it. Not her mind, but her body.</p><br><p>'What...? Why? My body has never let me down before...?' Nessa muttered in disbelief, looking at her hands that were struggling to move.</p><br><br><p>Snow Follower walked serenely forward, while his katana filled with energy, beginning to shake violently from the great power that it could barely hold.</p><br><p>"Nessa! Fuck! He's really going to kill you!" Magnus shouted in panic.</p><br><p>Nessa raised her head, meeting Snow Follower's cold gaze.</p><br><p>It was as if He was saying, 'This time, it's over.'</p><br><p>Snow Follower stopped, bringing his hand up to attack, about to pierce Nessa with thrust.</p><br><p>At the same moment, electric shocks passed near Silvana. When she turned around, she saw Adam cutting through the barrier with his silver needle.</p><br><p>However... Something in his gaze wasn't right.</p><br><p>He was going to save Nessa, but... was that a reason for Nessa to rejoice?</p>
