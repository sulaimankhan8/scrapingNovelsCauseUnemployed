            <h4>Chapter 1377: New Place</h4><br><p>The Dark Heart, Connected Heart, and Desire of Beyond.
</p><br><p>These were the three conditions for creating the Second Grand Star. Adam had already fulfilled one of these conditions when he defeated Ureyn. He knew a lot about the other and was waiting for the right moment to go to the places where the Hybrids lived to obtain the Dark Heart.
</p><br><p>But the Desire of Beyond was a mystery to Adam from the very beginning. He did not know what it was or how he was supposed to fulfill this mysterious condition.
</p><br><p>He went to the Silver Beacon only because Norax promised him that he would be able to find the Desire of Beyond there.
</p><br><p>Well, even though Adam did it at the White Spire, technically, Norax did not lie and did Adam a favor.
</p><br><p>Only at the very end did Adam understand what the Desire of Beyond really was, and the truth about it brought a bitter but satisfied smile to his face.
</p><br><br><p>Light footsteps echoed in the emptiness as a man in a white robe, with pale skin and thick black hair, moved toward the great tree emitting a dazzling light.
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver’s blue eyes rose to the top of the Evolution Tree, staring intently at the Branch Crystal, which was too damaged to continue working and supplying Adam with power.
</p><br><p>However, before heading to his destination point, the Silver Weaver looked at the very center — at the Initial Gene, where Lone Blaze was now located. She was the leader in this small space that Adam had given her.
</p><br><br><p>With a slight tremor, the Silver Weaver appeared in the darkness as he locked eyes with Lone Blaze, who seemed to be waiting for him.
</p><br><p>"You... You are the Desire of Beyond?" Lone Blaze asked affirmatively, but her voice was full of disbelief.
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver nodded.
</p><br><p>"Yes. Unlike you, who came here from the real world, I have always been a part of Adam’s consciousness. From the very first day he became a Phantom."
</p><br><p>Before Lone Blaze could respond, the Silver Weaver vanished and reappeared in front of her. His blue eyes were deep and menacing as he looked down at her.
</p><br><p>"So, I would like there to be no misunderstanding between us. I am the reason you are in this space in the first place."
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze gulped. She hadn’t expected things to take such a sharp turn. What’s more, she wanted to respond to the Silver Weaver, but simply couldn’t. His presence weighed heavily on her.
</p><br><p>"However, we are not enemies, but allies, right?"
</p><br><p>Lone Blaze nodded slowly, hoping that was the correct answer.
</p><br><p>"Good. In that case, you must understand that your power is not enough to keep up with Adam’s level." The Silver Weaver looked around. "But you don’t have to worry about that. Now that I’m here, I’ll help you become the driving force of this space again. Well, second only to me, of course."
</p><br><br><p>The Silver Weaver touched Lone Blaze’s forehead as ripples ran through her body like the surface of a lake.
</p><br><p>The next thing Lone Blaze saw was the Silver Weaver leaving her space, and she herself being engulfed by a white flame that enclosed her in a cocoon.
</p><br><p>"Don’t worry. By the time Adam wakes up, you’ll have moved on to the next level, too," the Silver Weaver muttered before looking up.
</p><br><p>Silvana was too exhausted to be in Adam’s inner space, but someone else had always been there, appearing at the same moment as the beginning of the Desire of Beyond.
</p><br><p>[Instead of solving real problems, you decided to intimidate our Miss Flame?]
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver shrugged.
</p><br><p>"I gave her what she deserved. She has been in the Initial Gene for quite some time, but until now, she hasn’t had the opportunity to reveal the full potential of her abilities. That moment came because I appeared. But..."
</p><br><p>He narrowed his eyes as he looked at the cracked Branch Crystal.
</p><br><p>"Fixing this problem will be much more difficult."
</p><br><p>[Hah... That’s your job, isn’t it? You broke it, you fix it.]
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver chuckled, shaking his head.
</p><br><p>"Whatever you say. Agh, I should hurry, right?"
</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree’s voice was serious.
</p><br><p>[Even though time flows differently here than in the real world, only a few seconds separate Adam from death... What you did to him... even though it was necessary, it doesn’t change the fact that he’s critically wounded. Neither Silvana nor anyone else can save him.]
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver understood this well. The situation was under control, but it required his immediate intervention.
</p><br><p>After all, if the murder of the real Silver Weaver allowed Adam to become the Phantom and create the initial gene, then the Desire of Beyond, which had an Elder Level Form, was going to take its place in the ability closest to Adam.
</p><br><p>With a calm expression, the Silver Weaver headed for the top of the Evolution Tree. He took one last look at the Branch Crystal before touching it.
</p><br><p>"I’m afraid I can’t help you. However, it’s time to say goodbye anyway."
</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.
</p><br><p>New cracks ran across the Branch Crystal as it shattered into countless fragments, but the Silver Weaver did not allow them to be lost in the boundless space.
</p><br><p>His powerful aura burst forth as dense white flames caused the fragments to hover in the air.
</p><br><p>The branches of the Evolution Tree trembled, for they knew that changes were coming and that they were inevitable.
</p><br><p>"I hope you’re ready, old tree... You’ll have to take part in this, too."
</p><br><p>[Pha! You appeared just a few minutes ago, and you’re acting too arrogantly! Show some respect! I’m ready to endure even what you can’t imagine!]
</p><br><p>In response, the Silver Weaver shrugged and stretched out his hand.
</p><br><p>"I warned you. I’m not as soft as simple energy or that External Artifact in your center."
</p><br><p>A multitude of threads turned into a long white needle that was firmly in his grasp.
</p><br><p>"I prefer effective methods, and sometimes the fastest way is to simply cut off the unnecessary and add the necessary."
</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree knew what was coming.
</p><br><p>[Get started already.]
</p><br><br><p>The Silver Weaver waved his hand, cutting off the first branch he deemed unnecessary at the top of the Evolution Tree, and it was far from the first.</p>
