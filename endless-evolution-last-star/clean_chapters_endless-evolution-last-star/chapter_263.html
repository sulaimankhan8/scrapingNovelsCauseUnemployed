            <br><p>Phantoms - they were the Citadel's main power, no, the only power that was able to resist the uncontrolled onslaught from the monsters.</p><br><p>Only they could kill strong monsters, in all its time, the Citadel could only find a way to defend against White and Green Threat Level Monsters, next to the walls using powerful cannons.</p><br><p>However, what was the main power of the Phantoms? Their abilities? Yes. Their physical strength and instincts? Yes. Their Nexuses?</p><br><p>Yes. Their combat experience and Resonance? Also, yes.</p><br><p>The power of Phantoms was multifaceted, all Phantoms were different, but it all started with one thing, genes and physical enhancement.</p><br><p>Some weak White Threat Level monster couldn't even do much damage to a K3 or K4 Phantom, because it would be like an ant trying to bite through the thick skin of a hippo.</p><br><p>But, what about the Hybrid?</p><br><p>Adam realized at a glance that the main pillar of Nessa's strength was her instincts and physical abilities. He was sure that no K0-Phantom could defeat Nessa, even with the use of all its abilities and Traits.</p><br><p>The situation was similar to the military who simply couldn't use monster materials for battle because it was just ineffective due to many factors, be it weight, lack of speed, or anything else.</p><br><p>No matter what K0-Phantom was capable of, Nessa was simply too fast and strong. Before K0-Phantom could attack, Nessa would have already dealt a fatal blow or would have dodged if the attack was sudden. Either way, her victory was inevitable because she was on another level.</p><br><p>Adam already knew what the result would be, as did Magnus, but for Silvana, it was still an intrigue. She didn't believe that Nessa, not a Phantom, was able to defeat Golden Spearman, one of the strongest monsters of the Green Threat Level.</p><br><p>Most K0-Phantoms couldn't even last thirty seconds against Golden Spearman.</p><br><p>"Wait, take your time." Magnus smirked, stopping both Nessa and Golden Spearman. Oddly enough, Golden Spearman seemed to completely understand him.</p><br><p>"If you can bleed her, you don't even have to defeat her, then I'll let you go." Magnus grinned widely with a sweep of his arm.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide as she stepped forward, not believing what she had heard.</p><br><p>"No! You can't! It's a dangerous monster that will kill quite a few military, Harvesters, and Phantoms if it gets back into the Dead Lands!" Silvana exclaimed, trying to change Magnus' mind.</p><br><p>An excited expression appeared on Magnus's face:</p><br><p>"Shut up! This is my lab! You're in my home, you're a guest! I can do whatever I want here and I always keep my word." Magnus exclaimed as he turned to Golden Spearman, "I'm serious. I'll let you go through the cracks in the walls, there won't even be anyone chasing you. All you have to do is hurt her."</p><br><p>Golden Spearman nodded, realizing who was in charge here, and decided everything. The monster did not attack Magnus, after all, it was useless when Nessa and Adam were here.</p><br><p>Then, Golden Spearman turned to Nessa, pointed his spear at her and his eyes shone brightly, increasing his aura significantly.</p><br><p>The golden energy from Golden Spearman's armor came out, like a flame that would burn for just a little while, but for that time Golden Spearman was gaining great power allowing him to transcend his limit.</p><br><p>"Oh, good. Not bad at all." Magnus nodded satisfactorily, taking a few steps back.</p><br><p>At this time, Silvana was nibbling her fingernails with great nervousness. Gradually, it was becoming a bad habit she was coming to more and more often.</p><br><p>"What if he can hurt her... That would be a local disaster for some Phantoms unlucky enough to run into him..." Silvana said in an interrupted voice.</p><br><br><p>"Don't think about it too much. It's not going to happen."</p><br><p>"But... His aura makes me shiver..."</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, and that's fine, but look at Nessa."</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Silvana shifted her gaze to the side.</p><br><p>Nessa was unfazed. She just stood still as if she was not a person but a living statue that only breathed occasionally though it was barely visible. It seemed Nessa didn't even blink.</p><br><p>"Just watch. I'm sure it'll be over pretty quickly." Adam shrugged carelessly, showing that Silvana didn't have to worry about it.</p><br><br><p>Golden Spearman stepped forward as a golden surge of energy traveled through his entire body like a wave giving him speed.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Golden Spearman went half the distance, leaving a long trail on the ground and raising wind currents that were cut by his spear aimed directly at Nessa's chest.</p><br><p>Then, when Golden Spearman was about to reach his goal, Nessa's body came into motion, she took a short step forward and when her foot touched the ground, her silhouette disappeared like a shadow in the sunlight.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils narrowed slightly to carefully observe all of Nessa's movements.</p><br><br><p>Nessa lifted her foot as Golden Spearman's head flew off her shoulders in the same instant, flying across half the room before falling to the floor. A second later, there was a slight rumble from Golden Spearman's armor touching the ground.</p><br><p>"Father, was that really necessary?" Nessa asked with a slight tilt of her head. To her, fighting against Golden Spearman held no interest. It was too easy.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes quickly traveled over Nessa. There wasn't a drop of blood on her body, not hers or Golden Spearman's.</p><br><p>Magnus lifted his chin. He didn't answer for a while, a gleam ran through his eyes and it looked like he was planning something.</p><br><p>"Well... Perhaps, but how about this? You haven't had any sort of difficulty in a long time, so... this is going to be a serious challenge for you." Magnus said before another drone flew into the room.</p><br><p>Magnus called it out before Golden Spearman and Nessa even started fighting.</p><br><p>Nessa tilted her head looking at her next opponent, one she wasn't prepared for...</p><br><br><p>Magnus did a full turn like a theater actor waving his coat before stopping on one foot and pointing at Silvana again.</p><br><p>"Go ahead Miss pseudo-seriousness, tell us about this monster, just add some expression. It got boring last time." Magnus made a disgruntled smile as if he was actually sad. </p><br><p>Adam shook his head. He'd asked himself the same question many times before, watching Magnus's antics - 'How did he ever get where he is now?'</p><br><br><p>The monster in the pod was also a Crown Type, Magnus had obviously called these particular monsters for some reason.</p><br><p>The monster's skin was a pale blue like that of a warrior from the cold lands, his body was covered by a wide cloak, slightly trembling, and tiny particles of it were constantly coming off, splitting off and disappearing forever. The cloak seemed to be made of energy or some unusual material.</p><br><p>The lower part of the monster's face was hidden by white bandages and his two eyes had deep azure pupils. The monster's hair was long and snow-white, slightly rippling.</p><br><p>The monster's legs and arms were covered in sparse protective scales, muscular with long joints and nails more like claws.</p><br><p>The nails were short for one reason - to make it comfortable for the monster to hold its weapon, a long katana with a white blade that emitted particles of snow.</p><br><p>"No way... You can't be serious..." Silvana shuddered.</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow with curiosity looking at Silvana's reaction.</p><br><p>"It's a Snow Follower. Top-9 among Purple Threat Level!"</p>
