            <br><br><p>Midway through their journey, one of the first guests approached Gladius, extending his hand to the tray to take a delicious appetizer.</p><br><p>Gladius lowered the tray slightly, looking at the obese man of medium height with a slight smile on his face, his suit, and especially the buttons doing their best not to tear apart with every move he made.</p><br><p>The man had disheveled hair and a short beard under his fat chin.</p><br><p>Next to him was a tall middle-aged lady in a tight red dress. They weren't Phantoms, but they weren't ordinary people either since they were nobles, not from the Twelve Branches.</p><br><p>"Oh, you know, I'm somehow not surprised that you're the first one who decided to try one of our chefs' masterpieces." Gladius uttered, a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>The man chuckled contentedly before shoving the first appetizer into his mouth and taking the second one.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, why do you think so?" The man asked he was in a great mood.</p><br><p>Gladius lifted his chin, looking him up and down.</p><br><p>"Because you're a fat pig with no willpower." Cold words flew from his lips.</p><br><p>The man was taken aback by such a rude response from a mere waiter. For a few seconds, he froze in place, not moving.</p><br><p>When he came to his senses, wanting to hurl insults at the waiter, he realized that Gladius was already far ahead, heading towards the beginning of the hall from where he started.</p><br><p>"Fuck... What was that all about anyway? Rgh, well, that's okay, when this is over I'll find you and make you regret what you said." The man growled, clenching his sweaty hands tightly into fists.</p><br><p>Realizing that he was powerless now, the obese man took a deep breath and shrugged.</p><br><p>Read new adventures at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Well, at least I still have this..." The man muttered, looking at his hand. His fingers were holding something.</p><br><p>Then, the man's eyes went wide as there was nothing in his hand, his second appetizer disappeared somewhere...</p><br><p>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.</p><br><p>Gladius nodded slightly, eating the appetizer.</p><br><p>'Yeah, the cooks did their best. Too bad they have to cook day in and day out for those who don't appreciate their labor or food.'</p><br><p>Silvana, walking a few steps away from Gladius, glanced at the obese man from time to time.</p><br><p>'What the hell!? Shouldn't we not attract attention? We're lucky this man isn't someone very important!' Silvana inwardly exclaimed, a slight shiver running through her body.</p><br><p>Unlike Gladius, who felt comfortable and confident, Silvana was nervous, she realized that if anyone in charge realized that they weren't who they claimed to be, Adam would be in trouble.</p><br><p>'Damn! Why had Franz and Rosalind chosen Gladius for this task in the first place? Couldn't they have found someone less risky?' Silvana internally shook her head.</p><br><br><p>Hour after hour passed, and sometime later that afternoon, as the sun was approaching the horizon line, a long white car pulled up to the luxurious palace of the Rouzet Family.</p><br><p>It was neither the first nor the last car that would stop at the massive, bronze gates today.</p><br><p>Most of the guests knew or assumed who would be attending today's wedding, so no one drew much attention from the outside. They simply followed the servants as they passed through the gate and walked along the gorgeous garden to the palace entrance.</p><br><p>However, when people saw who got out of the white car, they couldn't help but take notice. One by one they turned around, staring in the same direction.</p><br><p>"We've just arrived, and there's so much attention on us. What a surprise." Franz smirked, glancing around at the other guests before turning to the car and leaning in.</p><br><p>Rosalind came out next, but she wasn't the one Franz was expecting. She stood beside him with her hands behind her back, the dozens of stares did not embarrass her in any way.</p><br><p>"Come on. We promised each other. It won't be good if you trick your big brother. Please..." Franz said with a slight smile on his face, his voice growing quieter towards the end.</p><br><p>Hesitantly, the last silhouette moved before a delicate palm appeared from the car, fingertips trembling slightly.</p><br><p>Seeing this, Franz hastily moved into action and gently, though firmly squeezed the silhouette's palm, letting it show itself.</p><br><br><p>A small purple shoe touched the ground as a girl with long, velvety purple hair and amethyst eyes just like her older brother stepped out of the car.</p><br><p>"Nelya... You're as beautiful as ever." Franz uttered with a happy smile.</p><br><p>Nelya nodded uncertainly. The last time she left her room was months ago, there were times when the sunlight didn't reach her skin for days.</p><br><p>She was nervous and anxious, for her it was like for a child dreaming of being an actor to be on stage for the first time in front of a hundred stares.</p><br><p>And... it was all a consequence of the trauma caused by just one man because of his lustful desires.</p><br><p>Rosalind smiled, looking at Nelya with a glowing gaze.</p><br><p>"Ms. Nelya, your brother is right, you have only become more lovely during this pause."</p><br><p>Nelya's corners of her lips went up, forming an awkward smile. She was pleased to receive compliments, especially from Franz and Rosalind, the people closest to her.</p><br><p>But... as soon as Nelya decided to glance around, noticing the shocked looks staring in her direction, her face turned pale. A chill ran down her back and goosebumps ran down her body.</p><br><p>"No... no... I want to go home..." Nelya gulped, taking a step away, about to get back into the car to hide from the stares.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, behind her appeared Franz, who carefully placed his hand on her right shoulder.</p><br><p>"Relax, they're just curious and can't hide their delight. It's not every day you get to see such beauty." Franz pronounced, patting Nelya on the shoulder.</p><br><p>After a short pause, Nelya nodded and took a step forward. Then, she turned around to see Franz.</p><br><p>"Brother... You said you promised your friend to bring me here. Are you sure he's coming?"</p><br><p>Franz's corners of his lips went up for a moment before his face turned serious.</p><br><p>"Oh, don't worry. He'll definitely come. I'm confident he's waiting for this meeting even more than the rest of us."</p>
