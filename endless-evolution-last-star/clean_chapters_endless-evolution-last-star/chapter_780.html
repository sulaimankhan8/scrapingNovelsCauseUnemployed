            <br><p>One of the reasons for Katrin's defeat against the Dormant Lord was because she did not enter the resonance, the unique state of Phantoms when their genes were operating at their limits.</p><br><p>If a Phantom had a peak form, it was revealed during resonance. It was impossible to enter this state on purpose, special conditions were needed, but the most important thing was the will to fight to the end.</p><br><p>Even though Katrin had almost died, the Blind Sinner had saved her with her appearance, she still couldn't enter resonance for her long fight.</p><br><br><p>Katrin muttered in disbelief. She, surrounded by many Phantoms, stood on the north tower as the others watched the first appearance of the Unknown Phantom.</p><br><p>The moment Alan confirmed that in fact, the first Phantom had been Adam all along, Katrin couldn't believe it.</p><br><p>But... after a few seconds, she realized that it was possible.</p><br><p>'It's in his spirit... He only fights the strong. He defeated the three commanders and moved on, for his own goal.' Katrin thought a minute ago.</p><br><p>No sooner did she accept reality than once again she saw something impossible.</p><br><p>Adam's battle against a monster unknown to anyone hovering over the serpent lands began with a devastating throw, Adam destroyed the ice tower with his back, his blood dripping down the freezing edges.</p><br><p>However, that didn't stop him from resonating and nearly killing the flame monster.</p><br><p>One of the Phantoms, looking towards the monster shouted out:</p><br><p>"Wait! Wasn't that the Mid Yellow monster? Ten minutes ago, my Operator warned me not to run into that beast!"</p><br><p>The man standing next to him nodded deeply, his arms crossed on his chest:</p><br><p>"I can confirm that."</p><br><br><p>Abruptly, Katrin turned around and ran away.</p><br><p>The phantoms cast baffled looks at her, they didn't know what got into her, but they didn't bother.</p><br><p>Reaching a lone place, Katrin nestled against the wall, her palms touching the cold stone.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."</p><br><p>Katrin was breathing heavily, her pupils were trembling, running in all directions, she was in a panic.</p><br><p>"No... no... no..." her whisper was getting quieter and quieter, it seemed like her voice would soon disappear, "This can't be... I mean, I saw Adam just a little while ago... he didn't even break his first wall yet!"</p><br><p>Unable to fight her desire, Katrin turned her head to the left, looking over her shoulder at Adam, who was slowly emerging from the fog.</p><br><p>"Why is he even here...? How did this happen? How did he get so strong? What is that monster up above...? Is all this really happening...?"</p><br><p>Katrin collapsed to the ground, shivers running through her body in waves, countless assumptions and theories ripping through her mind, only building up her already serious panic.</p><br><p>If she didn't do something right now, Katrin would simply fall out of the fight for a long time, but the Phantoms needed her. She was strong.</p><br><p>Suddenly, she heard her Operator's voice.</p><br><p>'Katrin, calm down you stupid bitch!'</p><br><br><p>Her eyes went wide in disbelief. She and Alan had a good relationship, but given their personalities, he was always kind and caring, while Katrin was strict and serious.</p><br><p>To hear Alan say something like that was like thunder to her, it wasn't just his words, his voice was harsh and aggressive, a strong contrast to his cute appearance.</p><br><p>'Why are you fucking panicking? We finally know who is the Unknown Phantom, the threat from the depths of the fortress revealed itself! Yes, it's Adam, yes there's a lot we don't know, but does it really matter now?'</p><br><p>Katrin's lips trembled, she was silent, she didn't know what to say. Alan hardly ever got angry at her.</p><br><p>'Look, you and I both realize that even now Adam isn't going to defend the fortress. He has another purpose, for that he refused to help you and went to the depths of the fortress, nothing is going to change now.'</p><br><p>Alan continued, his voice gradually becoming softer:</p><br><p>'Katrin, the Phantoms need you, you must fulfill your plan to kill the Dormant Lord, along with Viron and Gnash. The people in the fortress need you, and so do I, Katrin.'</p><br><p>Alan gulped, struggling to maintain his stern manner:</p><br><p>'I need a cold and strong Katrin, so who will kill the Dormant Lord, protect the fortress from all threats, and at the end of the Eclipse, smash in the Unknown Phantom's face with all your might, just like you said!'</p><br><p>Katrin didn't notice it, but tears had been pouring from her eyes for some time now. In a strange way, Alan's words calmed her down.</p><br><p>For the first moment her heart clenched with pain, she believed that Alan was disappointed in her, to her it was a living nightmare, but like before, he believed in her.</p><br><p>'Right...' Katrin rose slowly, ignoring her tears, 'Alan believes in me, the other Phantoms do too. I mustn't give them any reason to be disappointed in me, we have to survive. I'll deal with everything else after the Eclipse.'</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Katrin put her palm to her chest and nodded deeply:</p><br><p>"Thanks, hah..." a bitter smile showed on her face, "The tough version of you is pretty cool... You can use that trick more often, I don't mind."</p><br><p>'It's...' Alan muttered, 'Not as easy as you think...'</p><br><p>Then, Katrin turned around, directing her confident gaze at Adam.</p><br><br><p>With each step, Adam's flames melted the snow, water flowed over the dense layer of ice, trying to escape the heat.</p><br><p>One of the first monsters to defend the ice north tower was the frost maiden, the crown monster with white hair, blue armor, and a long spear, with this weapon she killed the first monster that tried to attack the tower.</p><br><p>The frost maiden blinked as Adam appeared in front of her, she didn't notice how he was so close.</p><br><p>Adam's aura pressed against her, her heart clenched, a chill ran down her spine.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Adam gripped her spear tightly, wanting to take it for himself.</p><br><p>The frost maiden gulped, she took a step back, releasing her weapon. She couldn't argue with the creature in front of her.</p><br><p>Then, Adam directed his gaze upward, meeting the gaze of the Crimson Monarch.</p><br><p>Without a word, Adam gritted his teeth and tilted his torso back. His muscles quivered, making a swift spear thrust, bearing down on the Crimson Monarch like a flash of cold lightning.</p>
