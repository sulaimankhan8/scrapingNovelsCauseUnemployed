            <br><p>Each fort had many meeting rooms, most of them empty, so when someone needed to discuss something in silence, this was the best place.</p><br><p>Moreover, no one could overhear the conversation here, no one was in a hurry, and there was a quick opportunity to get the needed information.</p><br><p>Three silhouettes were sitting in one of such rooms, but even though it was a military fort, there was no tension.</p><br><p>Jets of steam escaped from the cups, passing before their eyes, coffee for Adam and Silvana, and green tea for Seyrina.</p><br><p>Seyrina took a short sip, put the cup down, and waved her hand:</p><br><p>"Feel free to ask if you need anything. Nothing wrong with a cup of coffee or cookies, well, anything to help you relax."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow giving her a baffled glare.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Maybe I look calm, but... I don't want this to happen again and even more, I don't want Silvana to burn in her flames. It's horrible."</p><br><p>"Sure, I understand."</p><br><p>Then, Seyrina crossed her arms over her chest as her stern gaze returned.</p><br><p>"In that case, I'll get right to the point. I think you should already realize that the fire, or the energy instability, is related to Adam's recent growth in strength."</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana nodded at the same time. It was too obvious to miss. Not even a day passed since Adam broke the First Wall and filled all the cells in the Star Seal. There could be no coincidence.</p><br><p>"Good, it'll be easier this way," Seyrina waved her hand before pointing at Adam, her eyes narrowed, "You... You've become too strong Adam Vinter."</p><br><p>Confusion reflected in Adam's eyes. He slowly poked himself in the chest.</p><br><br><p>"Yes, and I'm not talking about the speed at which it happened, though... that's a separate topic to discuss."</p><br><p>For a moment, a bitter smile showed on Seyrina's face.</p><br><p>"Just to think, in one night you did what other Phantoms spend weeks or even months preparing for. Well, considering what kind of monster you defeated it's a well-deserved reward."</p><br><p>From her last words, deep inside Adam, an interest sprang up.</p><br><p>"Speaking of which. Has the mission department determined how strong the Crimson Monarch was?"</p><br><p>Seyrina shook her head.</p><br><p>"No, it's not being done as quickly as you think. Moreover, it's quite possible that the monster you fought against is one of a kind, and..."</p><br><p>Abruptly, her gaze grew darker. Adam knew that look well - it was not a field he was prepared to enter yet.</p><br><p>"It's not something you should know right now. However, if you want to stroke your ego, I'll help you with that."</p><br><p>The corners of her lips turned upward, she seemed glad Adam asked about it.</p><br><p>"Regardless of what threat level will be assigned to the Crimson Monarch, you can be sure it was one of the strongest monsters the K2-Phantoms have ever fought against."</p><br><p>A dangerous gleam passed across her eyes, for a moment her aura grew stronger.</p><br><p>"Even less defeated."</p><br><p>Adam's pupils dilated, he wanted to hear something like that, though he would never admit it.</p><br><p>Staring at him intently for a while, Seyrina nodded to herself.</p><br><p>"Well, we got off topic. Enough thinking about the last battle, the Crimson Monarch is dead, and you've won. It's time to move on."</p><br><p>Then, Seyrina leaned forward, her arms folded in a lock, her gaze directed at Silvana.</p><br><p>"You may die, Operator, for your Phantom is now too strong. I'm sure your Evolution Seed has grown into the Evolution Sprout, however... it's not enough."</p><br><p>"In fact, you can check the condition of your Evolution Sprout. Immerse yourself in the inner space like you did during Pain Transition."</p><br><p>"What...?" Silvana shuddered, "You know about that...?"</p><br><p>"Sure, I had a few minutes. With my level and Operator, it's enough to know what stage of evolution you're at."</p><br><p>Seyrina's eyes ran from Adam to Silvana.</p><br><p>"You've both encountered problems you shouldn't normally have at K2-Level. Adam with the overwhelming power over both of you, Silvana with the wound from the Paint Transition."</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Silvana nodded deeply, she decided to do as Seyrina said.</p><br><p>This was still new to Silvana, but she had no trouble diving into her inner space where a flaming Evolution Sprout awaited her.</p><br><p>Silvana gulped when a bright light reflected in her eyes.</p><br><p>'Wow... Is that actually my power?'</p><br><p>Compared to Adam's Evolution Tree, Silvana's Evolution Sprout was nothing, but watching what the tiny seed had become, delight overwhelmed her.</p><br><p>However, the next thing Silvana felt was concern ready to grow into anxiety at any moment.</p><br><p>The energy traveled along the sprout, from its roots and the flames burning above, barely noticeable, but it gradually grew faster and faster, like a bomb going to explode.</p><br><p>Then, Silvana fully realized what Serina was talking about.</p><br><p>"Shit... We don't have much time. The energy is getting higher and higher, my Evolution Sprout just can't take the strain."</p><br><p>Though she didn't get confirmation from Seyrina, Silvana was sure her guess was correct.</p><br><p>Rubbing her chin, Silvana thought for a moment, remembering all the major events in order.</p><br><p>'Hmm... My Evolution Sprout is getting energy from Adam, that is obvious. Most likely while he was fighting I was safe, because he was using up his energy in battle, but when his reserves were restored, I was the one in trouble.'</p><br><br><p>'I'm safe now. The flames were weak by Phantom standards, otherwise, Adam would get hurt... but it turned out to be a good way to release the excess energy.'</p><br><p>Coming to her conclusions, Silvana took one last glance at Evolution Sprout and opened her eyes.</p><br><p>Seyrin noticed this, by Silvana's calm expression she understood everything.</p><br><p>"I see, you've figured it all out. Well, what else would you expect from an Operator."</p><br><p>After watching them for a while, Adam decided to have his say:</p><br><p>"In any case, Seyrina, what should we do to make sure Silvana is no longer in danger? Constantly getting rid of excess energy is not the solution."</p><br><p>"Hah, isn't that obvious?"</p><br><p>Seyrina grinned slyly, a gleam full of curiosity running across her eyes.</p><br><p>"You just need to become a K3-Phantom."</p>
