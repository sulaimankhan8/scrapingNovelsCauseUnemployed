            <br><p>Silence reigned in the inner space for a while. Adam tried to figure out what the purpose of the strange gates was.</p><br><p>The gates protected him, but how much longer would it last? What did he have to do to break the orbs and open all the lesser gates?</p><br><p>Once again, there were more questions than answers, but Adam was not alone. One creature knew more about the gates than he did, albeit only slightly.</p><br><p>[It's... The Crystal Gates, Adam... Only when you destroy all the orbs and open the gates you can advance further as a Phantom.]</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly. Some of this he already understood.</p><br><p>However, his curiosity was as great as before.</p><br><p>"I see... First the Two Walls, now the Crystal Gates. This place..." Adam turned around, glancing at his inner space, "It never ceases to amaze me."</p><br><p>[Ghe... Ghe... Ghe....]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree grunted like a satisfied old man.</p><br><p>[I can see in your eyes... that you fear the new rush of the Stellar Flow, but... the gates will protect you... it will protect us... you can be sure about it.]</p><br><p>Adam had no reason not to believe in the Evolution Tree. It often hid or understated things, but the Evolution Tree did not deceive Adam. After all, it was his closest ally, they were the same and depended on each other as much as any Phantom.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Adam turned around, glaring at the Evolution Tree. For a moment, his eyes went wide - he didn't notice how much the tree had changed.</p><br><p>While the Stellar Flow was trying to reach Adam, the Evolution Tree grew significantly larger. All of the energy that previously could barely fit inside was now able to spread throughout the entire tree.</p><br><p>Silvana was no longer in danger, it was obvious to Adam as soon as he saw his new Evolution Tree and its great aura.</p><br><p>"Hah..." Adam couldn't hold back a satisfied smile, "Not only is there more energy than before, though there was too much energy, but its density has increased significantly."</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree replied nothing, silently accepting Adam's praise.</p><br><p>Then... a look of bewilderment emerged deep in Adam's eyes. His face froze for a brief period trying to figure out if what he saw was true.</p><br><p>"Wait..." Adam narrowed his eyes, a great frown on his face, "Why haven't you changed in any other way?"</p><br><p>At first, Adam was glad. He felt the same as when he used the First Key, but when the first impression passed, he realized that there was almost no difference.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree was bigger and stronger, and the same was true for the energy flowing inside - that was all.</p><br><p>There were no new branches, no new features or details, the size changed but not the appearance and functionality.</p><br><p>This stumped Adam - last time every aspect of his power went to a new level, giving him an enhanced ability and something completely new.</p><br><p>[Hah... You finally noticed, right? Well... Each stage has similarities, but they're not identical... This time, you'll get stronger step by step...]</p><br><p>The shock thrown at Adam gradually turned into anger. His fists clenched tightly and a threatening glint ran across his eyes.</p><br><p>"Argh?" Adam growled like a wild animal, "You mean I did all this to avoid getting stronger at all?"</p><br><p>His irritation was understandable. Adam thought that as long as he didn't destroy the first orbs at the Crystal Gates, then his strength would be no different from K2-Level.</p><br><p>This couldn't help but make the Evolution Tree laugh:</p><br><p>[Hahaha... HAHAHA! Damn it! How...]</p><br><p>Fighting back its menacing laughter, the Evolution Tree struggled to continue:</p><br><p>[How can you be so naive...? It... Sometimes it scares me...]</p><br><p>However, this only made Adam angrier. With a fiery gaze, he swung his hand to cut through the darkness:</p><br><p>"Fuck! This isn't funny! Start talking normally, so I understand! I know you can do it!"</p><br><p>The urge to taunt Adam a few more times was great. It cost the Evolution Tree a lot of strength to restrain itself, but it managed.</p><br><p>[Fine... I'll keep this as simple as possible, enough of the riddles...]</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, waiting for an explanation. Anxiety was growing inside him, he didn't want to stay in one place.</p><br><p>[I'm afraid I don't know what happened to you during the creation of the Second Key, but... in that time you grew significantly stronger, by an intimidating magnitude. This has nothing to do with the use of the Second Key, it's entirely your merits.]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree continued:</p><br><p>[There's been almost no change with me, but... like you said, the amount and density of energy increased considerably, which means you and all of your abilities became stronger matching K3-Level...]</p><br><p>"So..." Adam thought for a moment before jumping to conclusions, "My mastery, abilities, and energy... Is that really it?"</p><br><br><p>"I mean, it's always nice to see progress no matter what it is, but I expected something more. After all, I didn't collect a few genes, I created the Second Key and became a K3-Phantom."</p><br><p>[Sure... I understand you... and... I think I have something to make you happy.]</p><br><p>Full of hope, Adam raised his gaze.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree's calm voice rang out:</p><br><p>[Turn around... There's nothing I can do about that, but you... that is another matter.]</p><br><p>Without further ado, Adam turned around. He didn't need any prompting as his gaze immediately headed upwards.</p><br><p>The highest orb trembled from time to time as if waiting for Adam to finally notice it.</p><br><p>The corners of his mouth turned upward, forming a bitter smile.</p><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree muttered in a majestic tone.</p><br><p>[The Zero Orb is waiting for you. I can't tell you the way to unlock it... but... I think you'll do a great job.]</p><br><br><p>One step away, Adam disappeared, the next moment finding himself at the top of the gates. Particles of darkness flew away from his body at his swift dash while his eyes stared at the Zero Orb with greed.</p><br><p>"Hah, I think I'm starting to understand what's going on here now. Pass the trial, and you get an orb, but... what's hidden inside the orb?"</p><br><p>A coldness filled Adam's eyes as his fist slammed into the Zero Orb, shattering the crystal into pieces.</p><br><p>A bright light illuminated his face, revealing his first reward, his truly new power as a K3-Phantom.</p>
