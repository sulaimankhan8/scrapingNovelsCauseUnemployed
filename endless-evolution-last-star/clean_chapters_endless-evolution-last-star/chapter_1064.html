            <h4>Chapter 1064: Dark Frontier (Part 1)</h4><br><p>Valdris returned to the main island, guiding Adam to the starting point of the wing trial, as Saegar called it. The two Lords remained aloft, surveying the colorful lands from the best possible vantage point.
</p><br><p>"Agh... You know, Kenward, I’ll never understand why you chose to stake out your territory. I mean, aside from the dew trees, there’s nothing noteworthy there, just soot, dust, and hungry monsters tearing chunks of flesh off the bones."
</p><br><p>Handing the third plate, cleaned after dessert, to the maid, Kenward took a deep breath.
</p><br><p>"You know. It was a promise. While I have the opportunity, I want to keep them beautiful. After all... Soon there may be nothing left of them."
</p><br><p>Oddly enough, no jokes or sarcastic comments followed from Saegar. He nodded deeply, understanding Kenward’s position.
</p><br><p>If it was necessary, he could be serious. After all, he lived in this world long enough to learn how to behave properly in any situation.
</p><br><p>That had its advantages and disadvantages.
</p><br><p>"Now... Let’s get down to the matter at hand." Kenward sighed heavily. "You didn’t come up with this trial to quench your thirst for a show and watch some Phantom and twenty of your young men fight over the Twilight Crystal, did you?"
</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Saegar’s face changed, as a sly grin spread.
</p><br><p>"Hah, of course not. I just needed a reason to keep him at the Dark Shore a little longer. Moreover, that way I can find out which of my young men are the most capable, the strongest. Achieving multiple goals with one decision is an art, my dear friend."
</p><br><p>Kenward waved his hand. "I am not your friend. You take that word too lightly."
</p><br><p>"No, it is you who takes it too seriously. I’m sure a friend is an ally you trust and know a lot about. A friend doesn’t always agree with you and doesn’t listen to orders like your subordinates. But a friend always remains in your life on the supportive side. That’s the whole point."
</p><br><p>Kenward answered nothing, but the fact that he didn’t deny it was more than enough for Saegar.
</p><br><p>After a few moments, Kenward spoke again:
</p><br><p>"So... What’s going to happen?"
</p><br><p>"Hah, what I wanted originally, as I found out about this young Phantom. You know me, Kenward. I love watching the show, but even more, I love being involved in one!" Saegar exclaimed. "I’m sure those arrogant bastards from the Befallen Crown are already moving here!"
</p><br><p>Kenward only nodded weakly.
</p><br><p>As soon as Saegar made Adam a suggestion, then he figured it all out.
</p><br><p>"It’s an unusual Phantom, and they know it. They can’t let the stellar Phantom get the Twilight Crystal. Even if it’s a tiny chance, they can’t let another Second Rank Phantom appear in this world!
</p><br><p>"I was hoping that the idiots from the Sacrificial Waterfalls, those stupid monsters that can only regenerate, would panic and report everything to the authorities. Oh, how right I was!"
</p><br><p>The maid approached Kenward, bringing him his fourth dessert. He nodded slightly in appreciation.
</p><br><p>"Who do you think they sent?"
</p><br><p>"Well... I know that many at the Befallen Crown don’t like me, to put it mildly. So, to deal with me and surely kill the Phantom that at any moment could get to the Twilight Crystal, they had to act quickly and sharply."
</p><br><p>Saegar rubbed his chin with a thoughtful expression.
</p><br><p>"Hmm... I think two or even three Earls. That’s their limit for such a matter. They couldn’t send weaker Lords, and gather stronger ones... They don’t have time or enough reason."
</p><br><p>"You know," Kenward muttered, taking a bite. "Though it’s only the Earls, but you might have a problem. You consider them inferior Lords, and in that matter, the majority agree with you, but... they’re not that far from true power."
</p><br><p>"Pffft! I know all the risks and am prepared for anything! Furthermore..." Saegar glanced at Kenward over his shoulder. "You’ll never say that, but you won’t stand by if my lands are on fire, will you?"
</p><br><br><p>Kenward placed a spoonful on the empty plate.
</p><br><p>"It was delicious, thank you."
</p><br><br><br><p>The wind currents ran with the black pulse, leaving behind cracks in the rugged earth with each of its powerful leaps.
</p><br><p>A little more and Gladius would reach the Dark Shore. He knew he was running out of time, but there was nothing he could do about it. He moved as fast as he was capable of.
</p><br><p>’Alright! Just a little more!’
</p><br><p>Soon, a high wall of darkness appeared in the distance, tearing toward the black sky like fire from hell. It was one of the entrances at the Dark Shore, which for Gladius was the closest if he wanted to reach the Sacrificial Waterfalls.
</p><br><p>The lands behind him were inhabited by dangerous monsters, each strong enough to defeat Arnoth or kill Adam in a single swing of a paw, all of them wild and cruel as beasts, yet they feared Gladius like the plague.
</p><br><br><p>At last, Gladius slowed down. He had to spend valuable seconds doing so as two figures appeared in front of the barrier.
</p><br><p>A middle-aged woman in dark robes and a broad-shouldered man hovered above the ground, guarding the wall like a forbidden gate. Their eyes were red with vertical pupils, a single horn grew from their heads, and they were held above the ground by wide wings resembling demonic wings.
</p><br><p>Their powerful auras were working at full strength, preventing the unworthy monsters from approaching the wall even a kilometer away.
</p><br><p>However, their warning could not stop Gladius. It meant only one thing - he came here to get to the Dark Shore and they couldn’t let that happen.
</p><br><p>Was there fear or at least tension in Gladius’s eyes?
</p><br><br><p>He was afraid he might not make it to the show before Adam found the Twilight Crystal. At that moment it would be over and he would be left with only crumbs from the table, he would miss the main course and that feeling was tearing him up inside.
</p><br><p>Did the two guards realize this?
</p><br><p>Unfortunately for them, no.</p>
