            <h4>Chapter 1114: Worst and Best Races (Part 2)</h4><br><p>Humans and monsters were ancient enemies. Everyone knew this, and no one doubted that monsters were the enemies of humanity. Naturally, it was logical for humans to support each other.
</p><br><p>Well, many people argued and had conflicts, especially when it came to people from the Upper Ring and the Lower Ring, but in general, everyone understood that they were alone against the monsters.
</p><br><p>So, it was a shock for Adam and Silvana to hear from Douglas, one of the most important people who had put a lot of effort into strengthening humanity, that humans had only flaws while monsters were perfect beings.
</p><br><p>Adam frowned. "Douglas? What do you mean, monsters are perfect? That doesn’t sound very good, you know?"
</p><br><p>In response, Douglas smiled bitterly.
</p><br><p>"Well, it’s not my wish. That’s how our world is, and all I can do is work with what I have. Think about it yourselves. Monsters don’t have technology and incubators, but... then how come by the end of the World Wipe, there are billions of them, and we don’t even have 100 million?"
</p><br><p>This question stumped Silvana and Adam. They had no answer.
</p><br><p>"It’s simple. They don’t need it. They are born directly from energy and then use the usual method. This is especially noticeable in the first years of the World Wipe. There aren’t just a lot of them, there are endless hordes that attack the Citadel over and over again while we try to rebuild everything."
</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam tilted his head in confusion. "Why? Does something special happen after the World Wipe?"
</p><br><p>Douglas sighed heavily. "Not exactly. It’s just that the period we live in is considered the most peaceful. There are less than ten years left until the World Wipe, so there is not much energy in the world, especially compared to the first 50 years and even more so compared to the first 5."
</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam nodded weakly.
</p><br><p>"I think I understand. Immediately after the World Wipe, the world is overflowing with the energy left over from the shockwave. The more time passes, the less energy there is..."
</p><br><p>"Yeah." Douglas nodded slightly. "That’s exactly right. This affects the birth rate of ordinary monsters and the appearance of anomalies and artifacts. It is also an indirect reason why fewer and fewer powerful Phantoms appear towards the end of the period."
</p><br><p>Silvana joined the conversation. She had some thoughts on the matter.
</p><br><p>"Sure, the risk becomes smaller, but so does the reward."
</p><br><p>Then, she looked at Adam with a sly smile.
</p><br><p>"Perhaps if we had been born right after the World Wipe, you would have reached your level in a couple of months instead of a year."
</p><br><p>However, instead of smiling back, Adam shook his head with a dark look.
</p><br><p>"Nah, if everything was as Douglas says, then I would have probably died sooner or later. Even now, there have been many situations where I’ve been pushed to my limits. One more monster, one more mistake, or one more random anomaly, and I wouldn’t be here."
</p><br><p>Douglas nodded approvingly. He had been meeting with Adam every few months and had watched the young man grow before his eyes each time.
</p><br><p>"Good answer, but no one knows what would have happened in that case. Right now, you should focus on something else.
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened.
</p><br><p>"By the way. What happens next? I mean, does it all end here, we talk, and I go back to being a Phantom?"
</p><br><p>"Something like that. Actually, there is one important matter I need to discuss with you since you became a K4-Phantom, but considering how quickly everything happened to you, we can postpone it for now. However, there is something I need to show you right now."
</p><br><p>Without further ado, Douglas got up, took the half-empty bottle with him, and waved his hand.
</p><br><p>"Come on. Follow me, both of you."
</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana exchanged glances as they followed him.
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, they headed to the other side of Heaven Island, which offered a view to the west, opposite the Dark Shore.
</p><br><p>"Adam, sooner or later you’ll have to return to the Dark Shore, as well as venture into the far reaches of the Wild Lands. However, that’s not all there is to our world."
</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam stopped before rushing after them.
</p><br><p>"What? What do you mean? Are you saying there’s something else besides the Dead Lands, the Dark Shore, and the Cave Grid?"
</p><br><p>In response, Douglas nodded deeply.
</p><br><p>"Yes. Unlike the Citadel, the Dead Lands, the Dark Shore, and the Cave Grid, these lands have not always been in our world, although they cannot be called new either. They are thousands of years old, though probably much older."
</p><br><p>Douglas glanced at Adam and Silvana, who were waiting for him to continue.
</p><br><p>"With every World Wipe, there is a powerful shockwave that destroys everything that is not protected by a barrier, be it the power of Queen Elisa or the True Lords. So, if we consider that the Citadel is at the very center and the Dark Shore is in the east, then only these two areas are protected to some extent, everything else is not."
</p><br><br><p>Douglas spread his arms wide.
</p><br><p>"This means that everything that could survive the World Wipe gradually gathered in huge piles in the far corners of our world."
</p><br><br><p>Douglas found himself at the edge of the island as a powerful gust of wind blew in their direction, causing their hair to flutter.
</p><br><p>In the distance, there was no darkness or light to be seen, only ordinary land where it was difficult to make out anything.
</p><br><p>In fact, from such a distance and height, it was impossible to see the Dark Shore or anything that was so far away.
</p><br><p>However, Adam, Douglas, and Silvana could easily feel the aura reflected by the lands they were looking at.
</p><br><p>"What...? What is this feeling? How strange..." Adam muttered as his gaze softened.
</p><br><p>It seemed to him as if he were looking at the place that had long been his home—the slums.
</p><br><p>Then, Douglas’s powerful voice rang out.
</p><br><p>"Ahead lie the Tarnished Lands. If it helps you understand, it’s the junkyard of our world."</p>
