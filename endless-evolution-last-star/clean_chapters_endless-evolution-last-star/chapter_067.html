            <br><p>Soon, military helicopters arrived at Rusty Ruins, they took the wounded and escorted the trucks of the Scarlet River Squad back to the Citadel. Everything went smoothly and quietly, as a fighter aircraft with a Second Rank Phantom hovered over them.</p><br><p>The power of this Phantom was enough to prevent any monster from approaching the area. The Phantom's aura simply suppressed the monsters, intimidating them like a top predator to which all others were just prey.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Apparently, it's not Damien, I'm sure he wouldn't miss the opportunity to show off and put on some kind of show.' Adam pondered, looking at the fighter while Hazel was sitting in the driver's seat.</p><br><p>Zera was too exhausted and injured, but she refused to get into the helicopter - she chose the back seat in her truck to be closer to Adam and Hazel.</p><br><p>Soon, as they approached the walls of the Citadel, the fighter left them and headed north at great speed - far beyond the Rusty Ruins.</p><br><p>Adam gulped, for that could only mean one thing - the Second Rank Phantom had just gotten an urgent mission and had to destroy some monster to get rid of the threat.</p><br><p>Then, Adam remembered Prime Stone Goliath - his first strong opponent in the battle with whom he almost died.</p><br><p>Now, Prime Stone Goliath would be an easy opponent for him - one swing of its silver claws would be more than enough to win.</p><br><p>Between Prime Stone Goliath and the Steel Knight, there was a true abyss in power, but Adam could only overcome it with Lock revealed. There were still many stages ahead before he reached Second Circle and became a Second Rank Phantom.</p><br><p>Adam wondered only one thing - how dangerous a monster was the target of the Second Rank Phantom?</p><br><p>The mere thought of it gave him a slight shiver, but also anticipation, for he saw the potential and the opportunity to become stronger.</p><br><p>The massive gate opened to let their squad inside.</p><br><p>The high walls of the Citadel were both physical and moral support for every inhabitant and Phantom. They radiated protection and strength - something that was much needed in this world.</p><br><p>Thousands of military men patrolled the walls, keeping an eye on the surroundings.</p><br><p>Sure, the machine guns in their hands were useless against the monsters, but no one was going to use them, because there were more powerful weapons on the walls - massive turrets with laser cannons.</p><br><p>In fact, these turrets, unlike most other weapons, were capable of damaging White or even Green Threat Level monsters.</p><br><p>However, these turrets could only be used on walls, because they used a huge amount of energy from the Citadel.</p><br><p>"Agh... It's been a long mission... It's finally over..." Hazel sighed heavily as they arrived at a stopping place already inside the Citadel.</p><br><p>Then, she looked back at the other trucks, the Phantoms and Harvesters had gotten out of them, they were finally able to breathe a sigh of relief.</p><br><p>"Damn... I'll have to go looking for Phantoms and Harvesters again to fill the empty seats... How I hate to do that! Fuck!" Hazel exclaimed furiously, slapping her hands on the wheel.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>Hazel noticed this and explained, "Those who died today... I will always remember them as well as the other members of our squad, but life goes on just like missions. It takes staffed squads to take down monsters further, so... I'm obligated to do it like many others."</p><br><p>"And... How many times have you done this before? How many times have you had to find new mates?"</p><br><p>Hazel shook her head.</p><br><p>"This is the fourth time in these three months, but this is the most serious one. Being a squad captain can be pretty tough, you know?"</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly.</p><br><p>He hadn't thought about it before, because today was the first time he was working with a rather large squad.</p><br><p>Captains not only had to be leaders for others but also to take casualties and replace them cynically, because they couldn't jeopardize their living allies for the sake of not offending the already dead ones...</p><br><p>"What do you plan on doing?" Hazel asked, lying on the wheel with an exhausted look on her face.</p><br><p>"Well... I'm going to get some rest first. It's been a rough day." Adam sighed, getting ready to get out of the truck.</p><br><p>"Wait." Hazel said quickly and opened her NEP.</p><br><br><p>Adam received a message, the address of some place in the Second Ring.</p><br><p>"It's our squad's favorite bar where we always gather after completing missions - sometimes to celebrate, sometimes to grieve." Hazel explained.</p><br><p>Adam clicked on the message and immediately had a map with a picture of the bar.</p><br><p>"Black Shell? Sounds good."</p><br><p>"Hah, of course. It was my choice, I have pretty good taste."</p><br><p>"Yeah, and you're not short on the desire to flatter yourself." Adam smirked.</p><br><br><p>"Just show up tomorrow at 7 P.M, and that's it." Hazel waved her hand slightly irritably.</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>"And..." Hazel muttered, "We'd always be happy to work with you again. I'm sure Zera would love to see you on the battlefield."</p><br><p>"Maybe that will happen." Adam's corners of his mouth turned upward as he walked forward.</p><br><p>As soon as he took a few steps he saw someone in the distance whose voice had always been with him, but not on this mission.</p><br><p>Silvana stood next to a tall white building, staring intently at Adam, her arms crossed over her chest.</p><br><p>"Hey!" Adam waved his hand, running up to Silvana with a pleased expression on his face.</p><br><p>Losing contact with his Operator was always unsettling, as Phantom was left only alone with himself and his instincts - completely cut off from the world.</p><br><p>"Why did you refuse to take the helicopter?" Silvana asked sternly as she narrowed her eyes, "Even without examining, I can tell that you are badly injured. I haven't gotten all the data yet, but from the information I have, I know that you got into the Mirage."</p><br><p>Adam smiled as he poked himself in the chest with his thumb.</p><br><p>"I won, and I can stand on my feet, so why not do it and enjoy the view of the Dead Lands?"</p><br><br><p>"Hey, weren't you worried about me?" Adam smirked.</p><br><p>"Worried, so much so that I did this..." Silvana muttered, raising her hands.</p><br><p>Her black manicured nails were chewed off at the edges, and bite marks were visible on her thumbs. Apparently, Silvana couldn't rest until she got the signal from the military helicopters.</p><br><p>"I see... Well, I think it's about time I told you what happened. It will also give me a better understanding of everything. Furthermore, I have a few questions for you." Adam nodded understandingly.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Adam, all talk later! First, you have to undergo a medical examination! Jena is ready to receive you now!" Silvana exclaimed as she waved her hand. Even she, always cold and calm, couldn't contain her emotions.</p><br><p>"Fine, but first, I want to know what Essence is. It is needed to develop my artifact. Without it, I will go no further. That's an order." Adam said measuredly.</p><br><p>His last words were enough to make Silvana gulp. She realized that the best option to get her way was to answer Adam's question.</p>
