            <br><p>A frosty star streaked across the dark sky, heading straight for the Crimson Monarch. Adam's throw was powerful enough for the spear to travel hundreds of meters in a few seconds.</p><br><p>The Phantoms closest to him looked up in disbelief. Just a moment ago, they were going to save him, but not only did he kill the monster, but he used the frost maiden's weapon for just one attack.</p><br><p>It was unknown if the Frost Maiden would be able to retrieve her spear. To her, it was an important part of her strength. In any situation, she would fight for her weapon until the very end, but at the sight of Adam, she willingly stepped aside.</p><br><p>The frost maiden realized that if she showed even a hint of displeasure or took one second more of his time, she would turn into burning chunks of flesh from the sole sweep of the flaming needle in the next moment.</p><br><p>Not only this group and the frost maiden were watching the flying spear, but the Phantoms in the fortress and the monsters in the serpent lands were all watching the attack as one.</p><br><p>Some believed it would be enough to defeat the Crimson Monarch, but... that was more than naive.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch smirked, a blue glint reflected in his eyes, growing brighter with every heartbeat.</p><br><p>"Well, well... Threw yourself into the fray right away, right? And, it looks like you didn't hear me at all."</p><br><p>Holding complete control over the situation, the Crimson Monarch extended his right arm to the side, catching the frost spear in perfect timing. It was no more difficult for him than an experienced player to catch a ball.</p><br><p>The only difference was that if the Crimson Monarch made even a fraction of a second mistake, the spear would rip off his arms along with half of his body.</p><br><p>His voice was not loud, he did not shout rather he spoke calmly, but the complete silence allowed everyone to hear his words. It was the common wish of both the monsters and the Phantoms.</p><br><p>"At the last moment, when you almost killed me, then I made a decision, not a typical one."</p><br><p>Then, the Crimson Monarch gripped the hilt of the spear tighter, slowly turning its blade towards the ground. The frost energy tried to fight, but his energy was too powerful, spilling out in an active stream through his body.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter, I the Monarch of Crimson Thunder officially declare - I will make you my servant."</p><br><p>Before his voice could travel to the edges of the lands, the Crimson Monarch continued:</p><br><p>"Some servants are worth the rulers' efforts to obtain them. You are a suitable candidate."</p><br><p>Strangely enough, everyone had some sort of reaction except Adam. His bloodshot eyes only paid attention to the Crimson Monarch's movements, not to his words, which he hadn't even heard.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch lowered his head in a bitter smile.</p><br><p>"Ignoring me? Well, that's your right, but... mark my words. In a time not so distant, you will be grateful for my decision - I will protect your future, stellar talent."</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's words were not only strange but also mysterious. It interested many Operators determined to make sense of his speech, but the Crimson Monarch wasn't about to float idly in the air any further.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Red electric shocks ran down the Crimson Monarch's arm. He had only used his regeneration and blood before, but that wasn't his main power.</p><br><br><p>Then the Crimson Monarch glanced at the thousands of monsters and a hundred Phantoms, most hiding in the fortress.</p><br><p>"This only applies to you Adam Vinter. I'm a monster, I'm on.... the other side."</p><br><p>With a face as cold as ancient ice, the Crimson Monarch brought his hand back, filling the frosty spear with destructive thunder.</p><br><p>"Everyone else, all Phantoms... you will not see the light of dawn. I can guarantee you that."</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Crimson Monarch came into motion.</p><br><p>The thunder spear moved towards the fortress at a speed far greater than Adam's throw.</p><br><p>Unlike Adam who was fighting against the Crimson Monarch, his opponent, the Crimson Monarch's goals were far wider.</p><br><p>He knew at once where the Phantoms were hiding, what the situation was, and more importantly, where exactly he should attack.</p><br><p>Half a second later, the four archers on the towers and the Phantoms realized that the Crimson Monarch was aiming for the western tower, the one closest to the gate and the northern damaged wall.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch would achieve nothing but destruction and a few dead Phantoms, hardly enough to destroy the spire.</p><br><p>But... without the western tower, the situation for the Phantoms would be much more difficult.</p><br><p>Attacking the gate made more sense, and so did the risks. The Crimson Monarch could destroy the bridge with such a throw, and he didn't need to cut off the Phantoms from the monsters.</p><br><br><p>Realizing that something needed to be done, the serpent archers quickly fired shots, as powerful as possible in their situation.</p><br><p>Some of the Phantoms reacted quickly enough to join them.</p><br><p>Multiple projectiles aimed for the thunder spear, but... they couldn't even get close to it. The crimson electric discharges, dense like plasma, simply destroyed everything in their path.</p><br><p>This was another level of energy intensity, nothing and no one could stop the Crimson Monarch's spear.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A scarlet flash illuminated the dark lands, in a heartbeat, a deafening blast of dark red flame full of electrical discharges soared upwards in a majestic pillar.</p><br><p>The archer, the western tower, part of the wall, and a few Phantoms too close were wiped out, turned into nothingness. The crimson thunder didn't even have time to reach their bodies, the shockwave from the energy of the explosion's epicenter was overwhelming.</p><br><p>The debris blew sideways with gusts of dust, reaching the gate and the north wall with Viron, Gnash, and Katrin.</p><br><p>"Fuck! Why couldn't we destroy it!"</p><br><p>Gnash exclaimed trying to cover herself with her hands from the wind currents, small rocks crashing into her, fleeing from the blast.</p><br><p>For his part, Viron put his massive sword out in front of him, trying to see what happened to the tower.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, as the smoke screen fell, he was able to do so.</p><br><p>Viron's eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>The great tower, sturdy and protected by the fortress itself, was destroyed to its foundations, leaving behind only a wide hole in the wall - an easy passage for all monsters that could cross the water ring.</p>
