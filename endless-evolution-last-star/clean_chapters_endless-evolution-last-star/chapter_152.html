            <br><p>The final battle wasn't exactly what the prisoners had expected.</p><br><p>Adam had passed out without making one last attack, and Krana and Trana sat against the wall, breathing heavily and thanking fate that Adam hadn't finished what he'd started.</p><br><p>"And... Who won in the end...?" Lola muttered with obvious anxiety in her voice, as she glanced at the prisoners.</p><br><p>They too, were puzzled. It was clear from their facial expressions. The prisoners on the second floor were no exception.</p><br><p>Some were rubbing their chins thoughtfully, some were scratching the back of their heads, and some were ready to argue with their buddy to find out the truth. However, it wasn't up to them to decide the final outcome.</p><br><br><p>Edir abruptly lifted Lola into his arms and jumped onto the railing, causing her eyes to go wide.</p><br><p>"What are you doing...?! Put me down!" Lola shrieked embarrassedly, holding up her dress that tended to fall over her and expose the lower part of her body.</p><br><p>However... That couldn't stop Edir, who with a smirk on his face tilted his head, peering at what Lola was so desperately trying to hide.</p><br><p>"White...?" Edir raised an eyebrow, making Lola's face as red as a tomato, "Hah, how boring, but I admit it. There's something in such pure innocence."</p><br><p>Then, Edir jumped down, dropping Lola to the ground and heading towards Adam. His stride was relaxed with his hands in his pockets.</p><br><p>"Hey, both of you, so we don't have a problem later. You admit defeat, right?" Edir asked, addressing Krana and Trana.</p><br><p>His voice was calm and harmless, but as soon as Krana looked up, a chill ran down her spine.</p><br><p>Edir's smile radiated nothing but a hidden threat, and his narrowed eyes, like that of a lurking snake, were focused on his potential victim.</p><br><p>"Yes. He won. There was nothing we could do." Krana acknowledged, not allowing Trana to say anything.</p><br><p>Unlike her older sister, she didn't realize that there was a hidden meaning in Edir's question, and they only had one correct answer.</p><br><p>"Good." Edir smiled as he looked into the camera in the corner of the room.</p><br><p>As if by his will, a drone soon flew out of the ceiling with a strangely white box. However, inside was not the white set of clothes worn by the prisoners in the F-Zone, in the initial zone.</p><br><p>Edir nodded, but soon, a grimace appeared on his face.</p><br><p>"Hey, I'm going to move on too. Come one. If I want to, I'll deal with those twins right now. No one wants that, right?" Edir rolled his eyes.</p><br><br><p>Soon, a second drone arrived with the same white box that was meant for Edir.</p><br><p>Then, Edir smirked and threw Adam on his back, heading into the next zone.</p><br><p>"Lola, grab the boxes and follow us." Edir waved his hand without turning around.</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Lola blinked, puzzled, "Where to?"</p><br><p>read-only-on-MvLeMpYr</p><br><p>Edir chuckled evilly.</p><br><br><br><p>"You know... That was an incredible fight!"</p><br><p>Someone's voice came through, very distant and muffled, being barely audible.</p><br><p>"Damn... Enough... Stop talking about it already..."</p><br><br><p>After a while more, the voices repeated themselves, becoming clearer and clearer each time, as if they were getting closer.</p><br><p>Then, Adam finally opened his eyes after a long and pleasant sleep. He didn't know how many hours he slept, but his head was splitting as if from a bad hangover.</p><br><p>"Adam!" Lola exclaimed energetically, jumping on top of him.</p><br><p>Adam wasn't ready for this, and he just wanted to come to his senses, so he threw Lola off him, and strangely enough, she fell not on the floor but on the other side of the bed.</p><br><p>'What...?' Adam turned around, looking at Lola lying on the huge bed. Her eyes were shining brightly, and she had a satisfied smile on her face, obviously happy to see him.</p><br><p>However... Adam was more surprised by the bed, it looked more like a bed in a king's quarters than a prisoner's. It was so big that it could fit several people and still have room to spare.</p><br><p>Then, Adam glanced at the rest of the cell - quickly noticing Edir.</p><br><p>He wasn't paying attention to Adam, though he'd obviously heard that he was awake. It was impossible not to notice, though, because of Lola's shriek.</p><br><p>Edir was focused as he had a gamepad in his hands and was sitting in front of a massive screen playing some game.</p><br><p>It was obvious that he was using all his reflexes to win, but...</p><br><p>"Damn! How to get through this fucking level!" Edir exclaimed, nearly breaking the gamepad in his hands, but he quickly calmed down and came to his senses.</p><br><p>He turned around, waving his hand to Adam in greeting.</p><br><p>"Where are we?" Adam asked, slightly puzzled.</p><br><p>He realized it was one of the following zones, but he was confused due to the fact that they had defeated three Guardians in one zone.</p><br><p>"Hah, isn't it obvious? We're in the A-Zone! The most luxurious place in this prison!" Edir exclaimed, getting up from his gaming chair and heading for the exit.</p><br><p>"Come on. You've got to see this. I'm sure you'll be as surprised as I was when I first got here. For that matter, I still can't believe someone would allow such a thing." Edir waved his hand.</p><br><p>Adam nodded, rising from the bed. As soon as he did so, he felt like lying down again, the mattress was really soft and took all the pain out of his back after the fight.</p><br><br><p>Adam headed for the exit next to where Edir was standing and stepped outside - into the main hall of the A-Zone.</p><br><p>"Holy shit..." Adam muttered in a disbelief.</p><br><p>There were only about twenty Phantoms in the A-Zone, and unlike the other zones, there was no second floor, but every Phantom in the A-Zone rested as if in the best hotel in the Citadel!</p><br><p>A bar with an experienced bartender, an open kitchen with professional chefs ready to cook anything the prisoner ordered, massive TVs, full Internet access, and various gaming devices.</p><br><p>It didn't end there, as the Phantoms had all sorts of exercise equipment at their disposal, and services such as massages, a swimming pool, and several gaming tables for board games.</p><br><p>"Hey! You! Hurry up!" A middle-aged woman shouted unhappily, glaring menacingly at the contentedly cute-looking young man. He was dressed in a black suit with a white shirt like all the attendants in A-Zone.</p><br><p>"Y-Yes...! I beg your pardon!" The young man flinched, quickly running up to the woman with a tray with a bottle of expensive wine.</p><br><p>He bent down, poured the wine into a glass, and handed it to the woman.</p><br><p>She licked her lips, put one leg over the other, and glanced at the other young man who had been massaging her shoulders all this time. Oddly enough, she was dressed in an expensive dress and black heels rather than prison clothes.</p><br><p>"My oysters should be ready by now, shouldn't they?" The woman smirked.</p><br><p>"Sure. I'll get them now." The other young man calmly replied. It seemed, that unlike the first one, he had been working here for a long time and was used to the specifics of his duties.</p><br><p>The woman nodded contentedly and waved her hand toward the first young man.</p><br><p>"Have a seat. Keep a lonely lady company."</p><br><br><p>Adam shook his head with a heavy sigh. He didn't understand this woman at all.</p><br><p>Then, after seeing a few more scenes like this, Adam's eyes traveled further to something important - the black gate with a massive gold letter on it - 'S'.</p>
