            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1226: First Grand Star (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>For Adam, the Path Construct was a new power. However, he had already reached a stage where there were very few people in the world who could offer him advice.</p><br><p>It wasn’t that there were too few K4-Phantoms, but rather that, given the uniqueness of each Phantom, it was almost impossible to find similar situations with another person.</p><br><p>Now, Adam looked at his Path Construct, and all he could do was accept the new conditions and try to figure out how this part of his power worked for him.</p><br><p>“Wait… You saw that too, right?”</p><br><p>Silvana appeared next to him as she nodded uncertainly.</p><br><p>“Yes, this… I haven’t heard about it. But I have one guess as to why it happened.”</p><br><p>She pointed to one of the stars hidden in the shadows.</p><br><p>“Most likely, you were supposed to obtain the Memory Fragment as a condition for one of the next stars in this constellation.”</p><br><p>“You mean I fulfilled one of the future conditions ahead of time, and it just worked? I mean, I’m supposed to obtain the Connected of Dark Heart in the future, right?”</p><br><p>Silvana nodded again.</p><br><p>“Most likely, it only works within a single constellation. The Path Construct just made sure that the conditions for creating the first star were sufficient.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam nodded deeply.</p><br><p>He hadn’t expected anything like this to happen. His puzzled gaze directed at the star showed it.</p><br><p>But what choice did he have but to accept these conditions?</p><br><p>The greatest fear of a K4-Phantom was that his choice at the Path Construct would turn out to be wrong.</p><br><p>If the Path Construct replaced parts of one star with another, it showed Adam that he was on the right track, at least for now.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Memory Fragment appeared between Adam and Silvana, slowly moving forward, straight toward the first star, which was eager to shine brighter than ever before.</p><br><p>They silently watched as the Memory Fragment became part of the initial star.</p><br><p>Then, the light reflected in their eyes.</p><br><br><p>Twilight Crystal: 1/1</p><br><p>Midnight Crystal: 1/1</p><br><p>Memory Fragment: 1/1]</p><br><p>[All conditions have been met. The initial star, Star 3#, is ready to become the core of the Path Construct with subsequent changes.]</p><br><p>The initial star shone brightly as many lines radiated from it in all directions, like a night sky full of hundreds of stars, but only a few of them were bright enough to have any effect.</p><br><p>[The Star 3# became the First Grand Star of the ??? Constellation.]</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>Now, the star that previously had only a number had been given a name. However, this brought with it another mystery.</p><br><p>‘So, this Constellation will have a name? But why is it hidden?’</p><br><p>Next to the First Grand Star were several other stars, connected by lines as part of the Constellation, but they were not a foundation that Adam was supposed to develop.</p><br><p>These stars appeared as part of his future power, as something that would one day make him a Second Rank Phantom, and they reflected the path he had taken, from his first step to this moment where he had created the First Grand Star.</p><br><p>To complete a Constellation, Adam had to reveal the next Grand Stars, but before that, there was something else he had to do.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The First Grand Star trembled as two flashes flew out, soon revealing themselves as rapidly changing runes.</p><br><p>[The First Grand Star has given you the two Star Runes. The next changes will occur according to the Path Construct’s will.]</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes widened as he turned around and watched the Star Runes move straight toward the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>“Hey! What about my will! Fuck!”</p><br><p>Then, his gaze rose.</p><br><p>“Can’t you do anything?”</p><br><p>Strangely, all he heard in response was a calm, wise voice:</p><br><p>[Why…? Adam, you should have understood by now that I do not influence the Path Construct. This is no longer a battle for power between you and me… Now it’s you and the Path Construct, and I am your loyal ally…]</p><br><p>Confused, Adam blinked several times, trying to understand what the Evolution Tree meant.</p><br><p>Naturally, his gaze shifted lower, to the base of the Evolution Tree, where the restraining chains and the key holes of the Lock had once been.</p><br><p>[Well, now you see… Before, your power was in me… in your Evolution Tree, but that’s no longer the case. However, that doesn’t mean that our alliance is over, no, on the contrary, now I can be your ally completely and not worry that you’ll hurt yourself in your pursuit of power…]</p><br><p>Adam said nothing, but he listened carefully. He understood what the Evolution Tree was saying. On his way to the K4 Level, there were many moments when the Evolution Tree hid information from him.</p><br><p>Sometimes it was necessary due to circumstances, but often it was a decision made by the Evolution Tree. The Evolution Tree had to do this because it knew Adam better than anyone else. Even Silvana couldn’t compete with the Evolution Tree in this regard.</p><br><p>[The Path Construct does not make mistakes, because it does not make decisions. Now, all decisions depend only on you… the conditions, the battles, and the future. I can only hope that in pursuit of your goal… You will not forget that you are not immortal.]</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree trembled, using its energy to put pressure on Adam, like an old man who had finally decided to get serious.</p><br><p>[If you die… You will lose everything… and cause others to lose everything as well… Being dead, you will not save your family, remember that.]</p><br><br><p>He hadn’t expected such a speech from the Evolution Tree after the long silence between them. But it definitely had an effect on him, it was clear from his expression.</p><br><p>Then, Adam grinned as he clenched his fist tightly.</p><br><p>“Hah, don’t worry about that. With the Path Construct, it will be easier for me to deal with it, it just provides conditions, unlike you, who tried to turn a boy into an adult Phantom!”</p><br><p>[Hah… You’re right…]</p><br><p>Then, the Star Runes stopped, showing Adam what would happen next.</p><br><p>The first star run stopped in front of his Foundation Artifact, while the second took its place directly in front of the Initial Gene.</p>
