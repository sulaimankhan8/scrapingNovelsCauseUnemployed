            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1188: Is that him? (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>The Twilight Crystals were one of the most valuable resources in the entire world. Their size and energy density were decisive factors, but even a medium-sized crystal was useful to any Black Threat Monster.</p><br><p>The difference between them and the Midnight Crystals was that they did not have to be absorbed immediately.</p><br><p>Unlike humans, monsters had no way to store compressed Midnight Crystals. Well, almost none had.</p><br><p>However, storing Midnight Crystals made little sense for monsters. Obtaining a Midnight Crystal was much more difficult because when they appeared, it became clear to everyone within tens of kilometers.</p><br><p>So, even if there were monsters among those who could store the Midnight Crystals, it rarely happened, because, unlike the Twilight Crystals, the Midnight Crystals did not become more powerful over time.</p><br><p>The Midnight Crystals appeared at the peak of their power, creating a battlefield around themselves, a real royal battle for the right to possess the main treasure.</p><br><p>At the same time, the Twilight Crystals appeared secretly and slowly spread their energy.</p><br><p>This meant that a monster could discover a Twilight Crystal and not tell anyone about it. Then, it could return a few months later and absorb it, gaining several times more energy than if it had done so immediately.</p><br><p>Naturally, many took advantage of this.</p><br><p>The Kirani Colony was no exception. The territories under their control were large enough for several Twilight Crystals to appear there.</p><br><p>Over time, the Kirani Bugs found them. Other monsters in their place would have kept this information secret, but the Kirani Bugs, like other similar insect monsters, were completely unselfish.</p><br><p>They told their queen everything.</p><br><p>After that, the Kirani Colony not only gained a valuable source of energy but also a foundation for negotiations with other monsters.</p><br><p>The Kirani Queen understood that the Twilight Crystals could not remain undetected by other monsters or Phantoms for long. The energy from the crystals was too much and spread even beyond the Corrupted Volcano.</p><br><p>At the Corrupted Volcano, there were no monsters capable of posing a threat to the Kirani Bugs, but this was not true for other territories, especially the Phantoms. The Kirani Queen feared the Phantoms more than anything else.</p><br><p>Therefore, she made the best decision she could in her situation—to form an alliance with a neighboring, stronger area.</p><br><p>Well, the Kirani Queen had another option: to immediately absorb the Twilight Crystals without giving them a chance to gather enough energy.</p><br><p>That would have been extremely foolish and impractical.</p><br><p>If the Kirani Queen had three Twilight Crystals, it would have been much more profitable to make an agreement with someone for protection in exchange for one Twilight Crystal.</p><br><p>Sure, in such a scenario, the Kirani Queen would lose one of her three Twilight Crystals, but it would only take a month or two for this agreement to become profitable for everyone.</p><br><p>During that time, the two Twilight Crystals would have more energy than the three. The party providing protection also benefits from this. They would not have to attack the Kirani Colony, and in return, without any sacrifices, they would receive one Twilight Crystal, which is equal to two new ones.</p><br><p>Obviously, as an experienced leader and monster, Bathild simply could not refuse such an offer when the envoys of the Kirani Queen arrived.</p><br><p>That was a win-win situation.</p><br><p>The Kirani Queen received protection and time for the Twilight Crystals to accumulate energy, while Bathild and her people received the Twilight Crystal as well, even though there was not a single one on her territory, at the Thunder Peaks.</p><br><p>But, as with any agreement, each side had several conditions.</p><br><p>The Kirani Queen could demand protection from Bathild at any time. Bathild had to respond to her call, go to the Corrupted Volcano lands, and destroy the invaders.</p><br><p>That moment had come.</p><br><p>Marhen, as the second monster at the Thunder Peaks, received the message first, as the Kirani Colony and the underground of the Thunder Peaks were connected. The ruined kingdom, hidden underground, occupied most of the Thunder Peaks.</p><br><p>Looking at the lightning strikes, which were the most pleasant melody to her ears, Bathild turned around.</p><br><p>“Marhen, do we know these Phantoms?”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Marhen nodded.</p><br><br><br><p>“As I understand it, one of them wields a spear and has fire abilities, but he is unknown. The second one is Adam Vinter.”</p><br><p>At that moment, Bathild’s eyes widened.</p><br><p>When a Phantom became strong enough to kill truly powerful monsters, its name spread not only among humans and the Citadel but among monsters as well.</p><br><p>Subsequently, this led to people receiving titles, like monsters. Of course, the bar was much higher for people. To earn a title, a human had to reach the Second Rank and become a threat to all monsters, including the powerful Befallen Crown.</p><br><p>However, that didn’t mean that monsters only learned about the Phantom when he received his title. No, receiving the title was recognition that monsters couldn’t kill the Phantom when he was significantly weaker.</p><br><p>That this Phantom had exceeded all their expectations and become one of the pillars of strength for all of humanity.</p><br><p>As strange as it may sound, every K4-Phantom could be proud of himself if at least one Black Threat Monster had heard of him, especially if that Phantom had only recently reached the K4-Level.</p><br><p>“Are you sure about that?” Bathild asked as if it must be a mistake.</p><br><br><p>“Yes… I was confused myself. As a K4-Phantom, he has nothing to do here. The nature of his abilities and genes cannot be connected to these lands, but… It’s definitely him. He uses needles, his white energy, and a terrifying dark aura. Also, there are no mistakes in his appearance: black hair and blue eyes.”</p><br><p>At that moment, Bathild’s fingertips twitched as if she were nervous, but she quickly clenched her hands into fists.</p><br><p>“I see. You said the second Phantom has flame abilities? He probably decided to help his friend… Well, in that case, I should hurry. I can’t believe Adam Vinter came to me himself!”</p>
