            <br><p>Adam and Tron continued to discuss something, while Silvana reached the spectator room and sat down at the table, joining Dahla and Riska.</p><br><p>They said nothing and only cast occasional glances at Silvana's neck.</p><br><p>She would never have let anyone see the bruise, but... she didn't know about it, and this morning she didn't have time to notice it. She woke up, looked at Adam, and made him breakfast as she knew he was going to have a hard practice soon.</p><br><p>'Wait... Why are they staring at me so intently?' Silvana internally muttered, feeling uncomfortable under their gazes.</p><br><p>Riska shook her head and pulled a folding mirror out of her pocket, revealing it in front of Silvana.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide when she saw a distinct bruise on her neck in the reflection. She immediately realized where it came from, and her face turned red with shame.</p><br><p>Riska and Dahla glanced at each other, satisfied smirks appearing on their faces.</p><br><p>"So..." Dahla smiled slyly as she leaned forward, eyeing Silvana curiously, "It looks like you decided to skip the vanilla part and go straight to something more interesting. I approve of that."</p><br><p>Silvana was embarrassed, but that didn't stop her from realizing the hidden meaning in Dahla's words, but it only made her face even redder.</p><br><p>It seemed like steam was ready to come out of her ears with goosebumps, running all over her body.</p><br><br><p>Silvana cried out, quickly waving her hands in front of her.</p><br><p>"We haven't had anything, and we're not having anything! Sexual relations between Phantom and Operator recommended to avoid!" Silvana spoke as if she was reading the rulebook, though, in her situation, it made things worse.</p><br><p>Neither of them believed it, not one of them anymore.</p><br><p>Dahla chuckled with a sly smirk. A predatory glint passed across her eyes as she asked: "Oh, sure, no Phantom and Operator have ever been in a relationship or fucked, yeah let's pretend that's the case." Dahla waved her hand nonchalantly, "Then, would you be so kind as to tell me where that bruise came from?"</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip, she didn't want to talk about what happened yesterday in any way, let alone go into detail.</p><br><p>Well, Dahla wasn't going to stop there.</p><br><p>"Is your Phantom beating you up? You know, this is not something we can ignore. Every Operator is protected by the government and the military."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide, and her gaze went blank for a moment.</p><br><p>What Dahla was talking about was very serious.</p><br><p>Sure, everyone accepted that the Phantom was usually in charge of the pair, and no one minded situations where the Phantom was strict, demanding, and dominant because his Operator, who was a soft and insecure person, was fine with it.</p><br><p>But... beating, humiliating, and using brute force against the Operator by the Phantom was almost a mortal sin that was condemned by everyone, Phantoms and Operators, government and military alike.</p><br><p>Everything had limits.</p><br><p>Alexia and Louis were a pair Adam knew well, where he was acquainted with both the Phantom and the Operator.</p><br><p>Alexia could make Louis do what she wanted, and Louis simply had no right to refuse, well... in his case wouldn't.</p><br><p>However, Alexia would never allow herself to hit Louis or hurt him, that was a line that could not be crossed.</p><br><p>After all, the Operators were not slaves to the Phantoms, nor were the Phantoms owners of the Operators. Each one had their roles and responsibilities, as well as the agreements between each other that every pair came to.</p><br><p>Thus, when Silvana realized what Dahla was talking about, she immediately told it like it was, afraid that if she continued to keep quiet any longer Adam would be in major trouble.</p><br><p>Well, she just fell into Dahla's clever trap.</p><br><br><p>"No! Adam would never hit me... It's... It's not even up for discussion. Yesterday, I said a lot of stupid things, and... Adam stated he'd actually punish me if I ever said that he didn't need me."</p><br><p>Riska chuckled with a kind smile on her face.</p><br><p>"Oh, that's sweet, but what you did was silly. How can you say that? If Phantom and Operator don't get along, it's clear in the first few days. Then they look for a replacement, but this is clearly not about you and Adam. He treasures you very much, but... you care for him even more, don't you?"</p><br><p>Silvana looked away, she was too embarrassed to meet their eyes.</p><br><p>"Yeah... I'm just stupid... I'll never say things like that again, it was the stupidest thing I've ever done in my life. I'm lucky he took control of the whole situation like he always does..." Silvana whispered, at the last words, she bit her lip.</p><br><p>Dahla smirked as she placed her palm under her chin like a high society lady.</p><br><p>"Well, well, so that bruise on your neck wasn't a punishment but your routine? Damn, you two perverts."</p><br><p>Dahla was doing her best to embarrass Silvana even more, until that moment.</p><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana shot a sharp glance at Dahla, and the corners of her lips curled up into a satisfied grin.</p><br><p>"Well, well, I'd better not bring up that topic if I were you, or else..." Silvana narrowed her eyes, staring intently at Dahla, "Tron might find out what you were doing with his tissues."</p><br><p>Dahla was stunned, frozen with a static expression on her face for a long moment. She realized that Silvana saw her, for her, it was a real embarrassment. Especially since Silvana was the Operator and she was the K4-Phantom.</p><br><p>Riska, who was watching this scene, smiled weakly and nodded.</p><br><p>'Good, Silvana knows how to stand up for herself, and someone finally fought back against Dahla. Well, I wonder what will happen in the remaining time.'</p><br><p>Then, she looked at Adam and Tron, who were ready to start their first fight.</p><br><p>Silvana glanced at Adam with deep, thoughtful eyes, as she touched her neck.</p><br><p>'Maybe Dahla's right about something, this can't be called anything ordinary, but... I provoked it myself and... I've never seen a gaze like Adam's before. There's no way he'd give me up, that's for sure.'</p>
