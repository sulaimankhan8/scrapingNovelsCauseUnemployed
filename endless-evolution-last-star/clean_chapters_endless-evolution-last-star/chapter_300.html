            <br><p>Once again, the Thunder Demon appeared, bringing with him nothing but chaos, destruction, and to some extent, despair.
</p><br><p>Sure, this time the situation was not as chaotic as on the border of the Salt Village in the anomaly cluster, but... the result could have been much more dangerous because Thunder Demon stole the larva king!
</p><br><p>Adam stood puzzled for a while. He couldn’t fully comprehend what had just happened.
</p><br><p>’Thunder Demon? What? Why does he look like that?’ Adam pondered staring at one point.
</p><br><p>In fact, they were in a difficult situation because another monster had stolen the larva king which had consumed almost all the resources. It was equivalent to stealing all the resources that the Igno Ants had prepared for the birth of their king at one time.
</p><br><p>It seemed that only one of the Phantoms was the fastest to realize it.
</p><br><br><p>Osana’s eyes flashed as blue wind currents appeared around her, active but completely harmless. Her pink hair soared up as the sphere on her staff sparkled.
</p><br><p>Inside the sphere appeared the sign of snow-white wings - the same sign only several times larger appeared above Adam.
</p><br><p>Then, at his feet, ghostly white wings appeared, they rippled a few times before just standing in one place.
</p><br><p>"Hey, you’re fast, aren’t you?" Osana smirked, seeming to show part of her true personality for the first time, "Catch up to that bastard and rip his horns the hell out."
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes grew deeper as he nodded without further ado, activating his artifact.
</p><br><p>The Horn of Calamity hovering in his inner space next to the Evolution Tree shook vigorously, releasing powerful discharges of lightning that soon covered Adam’s entire body.
</p><br><p>A lightning horn appeared on the left side of Adam’s head as he cast a calm glance at them and looked toward the passage in which the strange Thunder Demon had disappeared.
</p><br><p>Then, Adam leaned his body forward as if he were a sprinter about to start his race with a powerful burst.
</p><br><p>Now, Adam was under three reinforcements at once: Katrin’s roots, Osana’s wings, and his lightning bolts.
</p><br><p>All of these enhancements improved different aspects, but they all affected his speed in one way or another, so... Adam couldn’t even imagine how fast he could be right now.
</p><br><p>’Alright, I guess you didn’t get too far. I just need to catch up with you and finish this...’ Adam internally muttered taking a deep breath before his body came into motion.
</p><br><br><p>The ground beneath Adam cracked as he turned into a bolt of lightning that in an instant disappeared from the room, passing through the passage leading to the surface.
</p><br><br><p>Katrin, who was standing next to Adam, had to lean on her staff to keep from falling to the ground because of the overly strong wind currents resulting from Adam’s rush.
</p><br><p>"Damn! What kind of speed is that?!" Katrin exclaimed in disbelief, afraid to imagine how fast Adam was at the moment.
</p><br><p>Then, she turned to Osana.
</p><br><p>"Hey, it’s all because of your ability, isn’t it?"
</p><br><p>Osana shook her head.
</p><br><p>"It’s a combination of all three enhancements. The result is really impressive, but... he won’t be able to stay like this for too long. I’m sure the strain on his body right now is incredibly heavy..." Osana uttered with a serious expression as she looked up as if she could see Adam through the walls.
</p><br><br><p>Oskar climbed out of the rubble with a serious look.
</p><br><p>"No matter, we must hurry too. Adam’s Operator will help us find it. It’s a Thunder Demon, so it will take all our efforts to avert disaster."
</p><br><br><br><p>At the same time, while Katrin and Golden Light Squad were getting out of the Igno Ants Nest, Adam was running after Thunder Demon, gradually shortening the distance, but it was still a long way away from catching the monster.
</p><br><p>"Silvana, what the hell is this Thunder Demon? It’s different from the Essence Thunder Demon I fought in Salt Village. Is it the Top-1 of the Purple Threat Level?" Adam asked with slight concern.
</p><br><p>He wasn’t certain if he was ready to fight Top-1 right now. Sure, he’d beaten Top-2, but he’d heard too much about Top-1, even Magnus had thrown in a few words, so Adam realized that this was a whole other level.
</p><br><p>’No, there’s a bit of a complication here. Look, this Thunder Demon is weaker than the Essence Thunder Demon you fought against but stronger than Jade Lady.’ Silvana tried to explain.
</p><br><p>"What, what does that mean?" Adam frowned focusing on the black dot in the distance that held a massive larva king on its shoulder. Thunder Demon was quite fast, realizing that Adam was chasing him.
</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, two lizards emerged from the ground, they pointed their horns at Adam, about to pierce his chest.
</p><br><p>But... before the lizards could do anything, Adam had already rushed past them. The electric shocks running through his body noticed the threat and rained down on the lizards, tearing them apart.
</p><br><p>’Look, if it was some other monster, then it would have taken the Top-3 instead of Jade Lady, but... since it’s a variation of the Thunder Demon, it takes a position inside the Top-2 where Essene Thunder Demon is at the peak.’
</p><br><br><p>’It’s something like numbers, there’s 1, 2, 3 and so on, and there’s 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and others, like decimal numbers. Anyway, as you noticed this Thunder Demon has four horns, not two, and the protective scales are black, they cover the whole body, rather than just some parts.’
</p><br><p>Adam nodded, turning sharply as the Thunder Demon had just changed its trajectory.
</p><br><p>’Anyway, this is a Prime Thunder Demon and among all Thunder Demons, he’s the second strongest. That is to say, technically its rank is Top-2.1. Prime Thunder Demon surpasses Jade Lady Top-3 in terms of power, but is slightly inferior to Essence Thunder Demon.’
</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam nodded deeply when he finally realized what was going on here, "It only works for monsters of the same species, and if their power levels are almost equal, right?"
</p><br><p>’Sure, you got that right. By the way, all other Jade Ladies except Conqueror Type are much weaker than Top-3, so... to some extent, the situation with Thunder Demons is pretty rare but real.’ Silvana sighed slightly, hoping that Adam understood her.
</p><br><br><p>"Hah, Prime Thunder Demon, interesting..." Adam muttered, stalking the black dot in the distance that was gradually getting closer, "He can use lightning too, right? I mean, it’s part of his name."
</p><br><p>’Of course, all Thunder Demons actively use electricity in battle, but Prime Thunder Demon’s electricity is not at all as powerful as Essence One’s. In terms of energy capabilities, they are on completely different levels.’
</p><br><p>’Prime Thunder Demon isn’t capable of giving out even 10% of the energy power that Essence One possessed.’ Silvana finished.
</p><br><p>Adam grinned widely, feeling that he was getting faster and faster and Thunder Demon could no longer run away from him. The distance between them was rapidly shrinking.
</p><br><p>’Well, despite that he’s a Top-2.1, almost as strong as a Top-2. That can only mean one thing...’ Adam inwardly pondered glancing at Thunder Demon’s sharp claws.
</p><br><p>’The lack of energy power he compensated by his superior physical capabilities. That’s why he’s bigger, faster, and stronger than Essence One.’
</p><br><p>Then, Adam took a deep breath.
</p><br><p>"It’s a pity that physical might is part of my power." Adam muttered remembering his Power Gene before rushing forward, finding himself right in front of Thunder Demon.</p>
