            <h4>Chapter 1131: Great Lake (Part 2)</h4><br><p>Dayra’s eyes widened as her face flushed with indignation.
</p><br><p>"WHAT? How dare you say such a thing?! What kind of monster would ask a human to kill another monster?!"
</p><br><p>Kolos looked at her with darkness and arrogance.
</p><br><p>"I don’t want to hear anything from a traitor. I can understand why he’s fighting against us, but your position is unacceptable. It doesn’t matter how you feel about Lyrod. He’s the strongest in this territory, which means we obey him! This rule applies not only to monsters but also to humans! All over the world!"
</p><br><p>Adam shook his head from side to side.
</p><br><p>In general, he agreed with Kolos. Monsters always acted on instinct and therefore chose the side of the strong.
</p><br><p>’But... The Awakened Monsters are different, especially the Elders and Lords. Kolos’s position is straightforward and understandable, but if I were in Dayra’s place... Hah, I wouldn’t want to be Kolos’s ally because next to him, your opinion is worthless unless you’re the strongest.’
</p><br><p>Kolos narrowed his eyes, staring intently at Adam.
</p><br><p>"What do you say, Phantom?"
</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head with a doubtful expression.
</p><br><p>"Look, this all seems rather strange. Let’s say I agree to let you kill her, and... what happens next? You attack her and kill her, and then you fight me? Moreover, there are problems with your logic."
</p><br><p>Koros said nothing, but his irritation was evident on his sullen face.
</p><br><p>"If the monster’s power is so important to you, then by killing Dayra, you will only put Lyrod and your entire territory in a difficult position. Instead of trying to kill her, you should have tried to negotiate with her and attack me together, and then resolve your differences."
</p><br><p>Dayra gulped. She didn’t know what was stranger to her, that Koros’s veins were bulging with anger, or that Adam’s words were essentially a plan that could have worked, but no longer could.
</p><br><p>"Tsk. Dayra isn’t the only Elder at the Tarnished Lands! But there are far fewer monsters that have fallen into the dark dream! It’s a sign that a Lord will soon appear on our land! Moreover, I don’t know how it works with humans, but I don’t work with traitors!"
</p><br><br><p>Adam’s frame shook as he appeared right in front of Kolos, who seemed ready to shower Dayra with curses for eternity.
</p><br><p>Kolos’s expression froze as his gaze dropped lower to meet Adam’s calm eyes.
</p><br><p>"Well, I have an answer for you."
</p><br><p>Adam clenched his fist tightly.
</p><br><p>"We don’t like traitors either, but if it’s necessary to achieve our goals, we’ll do anything, form alliances with anyone, and stoop as low as we need to."
</p><br><p>Kolos crossed his arms in front of him as Adam’s fist slammed into his block with full force.
</p><br><p>The shockwave passed through Kolos’s body, causing his scales to tremble, but he was able to remain standing.
</p><br><p>"In that case...!" Kolos exclaimed as his tail began to move. "I have no choice but to kill you both! My mission is true! Neither traitors nor humans dare stand in the way of monsters!"
</p><br><br><p>The tail swept over Adam’s head, who had anticipated Kolos’s attack and dodged it. A trail of green flame remained in the air before being cut by the wide blade of the first needle.
</p><br><p>Blood gushed from Kolos’s right shoulder, flooding the dark ground ahead.
</p><br><p>"No! It won’t end so quickly!"
</p><br><p>Flames surrounded Kolos when a great sword appeared in his hand, surpassing even Adam’s first needle in size.
</p><br><p>"Oh, what a large weapon. Aren’t you afraid you won’t be fast enough?"
</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Kolos gripped the hilt tightly with both hands as his contemptuous gaze fell upon Adam.
</p><br><p>"Shut your filthy mouth!" Kolos growled, and a stream of trembling flames shot out of his sword, reaching for the heavens.
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam did not continue his series of attacks. He was wary of the flames at Kolos’s feet and his tail, which could deliver a critical blow to Adam if struck successfully.
</p><br><p>"If he’s the type who fights by putting all his strength into one attack, then I’m ready to accept those conditions!"
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The space trembled from Kolos’s power. A little more and he would be ready to destroy everything in front of him, including Adam, leaving hardly even a handful of ashes.
</p><br><p>Dayra shook her head fearfully from side to side as she stepped forward.
</p><br><br><p>Adam’s low voice stopped her.
</p><br><p>"Maybe I won’t let him break our agreement, but this is a battle I must fight alone. I don’t need your help to defeat some delusional Elder who is obsessed with following stupid rules."
</p><br><p>Before Dayra could respond, something silenced her.
</p><br><p>A powerful aura, a force beyond her comprehension, emanated from Adam.
</p><br><p>Instinctively, Dayra took a few steps back so as not to accidentally get caught in the blast zone, even though she didn’t even know what she was waiting for.
</p><br><p>"This... Wait... What is this?" Dayra thought.
</p><br><p>For a brief moment, she thought she saw someone next to Adam, which couldn’t be true because he was alone there.
</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.
</p><br><p>His needle shattered into fragments as his hand moved smoothly forward, remaining below.
</p><br><p>On the other side, Kolos had reached the limit of his power — flames erupted from his sword like magma from an active volcano.
</p><br><p>"DIE!" Kolos shouted in anger, slamming his sword into the ground.
</p><br><p>A torrent of flames destroyed everything in its path, stones flying in all directions as cracks ran across the surface.
</p><br><p>Adam’s lips trembled once.
</p><br><br><p>’Sure. You just have to say the word and I’ll be with you anytime, anywhere. All we need is our imagination and willpower!’
</p><br><p>There was no panic in Adam’s eyes despite the approaching flames because he knew that they were no obstacle to him.
</p><br><p>A smirk was about to appear on Kolos’s face when...
</p><br><br><p>A click sounded as the scissors closed.
</p><br><p>A line faster than the speed of sound ran from Adam to Kolos and much further, dividing everything in its path in two.
</p><br><p>Dayra’s eyes fluttered as she watched Kolos’s severed body, but then she looked toward the lake.
</p><br><br><p>The great lake was split in two, causing acid to flow actively to hide the exposed bottom.</p>
