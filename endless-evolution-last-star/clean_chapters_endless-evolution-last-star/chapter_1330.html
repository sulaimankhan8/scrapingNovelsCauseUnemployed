            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1330: My energy hasn’t run out yet</strong></p><br><p>Despite the fact that Pokko was supposed to be a serious threat to Adam, on the same level as Narica, the poor teddy bear couldn’t even last a full round.</p><br><p>Adam’s attack was supposed to destroy Pokko, but Misty didn’t let that happen. Sure, Pokko wouldn’t have died, because he was essentially one of Misty’s abilities, but she didn’t treat him like a tool.</p><br><p>If she could protect her favorite teddy bear, she would do so, even if the opponent was a K4-Phantom who was halfway to reaching his actual power after a strong setback.</p><br><br><p>Sparks flew before Misty’s eyes as she swung her umbrella, throwing Adam aside.</p><br><p>She controlled her power because her task was to train him, not kill him. However, perhaps Misty should have increased her power a little, at least this time.</p><br><p>Adam didn’t even hit the ground before he created a ball of energy behind him, easily bouncing off it with explosive force.</p><br><p>This technique was often used by stronger beings who could easily stand in the air to fight. Someone like Misty, for example.</p><br><br><p>She stepped forward, blocking Adam’s next lunge. All she had to do was swing her umbrella, throwing Adam aside, but that couldn’t stop him. He did the same thing, attacking Misty again, who was now the center of his attention, while Pokko was able to move away to the side.</p><br><p>The next minute, Adam was wasting his energy on constant jumps in the air and attacks, while Misty stood in the air and blocked all his attacks from different sides.</p><br><p>Pokko, who was watching from the sidelines, was no longer able to see all of Adam’s actions, who had become too fast for Pokko’s eyes. The difference between their levels became increasingly obvious and continued to grow.</p><br><p>All the dark bear could see were white flashes that repeatedly crashed into his mistress, who calmly blocked all of Adam’s attacks with just one hand.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Adam’s aura continued to grow with each heartbeat, a new pulse of energy running through the Energy Axis, causing the threads to weave together, essentially increasing his progress by a percentage every few seconds.</p><br><p>In fact, what was happening was caused not only by Adam’s will or desire, but essentially by his confidence in his own abilities.</p><br><p>He knew he couldn’t defeat Misty, she was a Lord, but he believed that what he was demonstrating was not his limit.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, but in this position it was impossible to make a mistake, because the Energy Axis not only protected him from overload, but also blocked his full power for his own safety.</p><br><p>But everything had its limits.</p><br><br><p>A vein on Adam’s forearm burst as blood gushed out. It didn’t make him stop, but it helped Misty realize that it was time to end their fight.</p><br><p>“About 60-65%, right?” she thought as Adam lunged at her again. “Not bad, I’m sure he’ll complain about this result too, but it looks like it’s time to end it. He believes he is capable of more, but his body has not yet had time to adapt.”</p><br><p>This time, Misty didn’t use her umbrella. She let go of the handle, leaving the umbrella floating in the air next to her.</p><br><p>Then, she stepped forward and appeared to the right of Adam like a ghost.</p><br><p>All he felt was a light tap on his chest before several circles floated above Misty’s hand, coming together to release a single powerful blast.</p><br><p>The impact threw Adam to the other end of the hall, causing his back to crash into the wall with such force that he sank several meters into it.</p><br><p>Considering that this was Norax’s mill and every brick here had enough energy to be a weapon even against the Lords, let alone ordinary people, it was more serious than it might seem at first glance.</p><br><br><p>Misty slowly landed on the ground, confident that Adam would not get up anytime soon after such an attack.</p><br><br><p>“Hmm?” Misty narrowed her eyes as she saw a figure emerging from the smoke screen.</p><br><p>Adam climbed out of the rubble and limped forward, struggling to hold his sword.</p><br><p>“Agh… Agh… Agh…” His heavy breathing spread throughout the hall, while energy wandered through his body.</p><br><br><p>He fell to one knee as Misty nodded weakly. He had lasted longer than she thought, but overall, everything had gone differently than she had expected.</p><br><p>“Enough, Adam. Even if your Energy Axis completely trusts you and continues to increase your energy usage limit, that doesn’t mean your body can withstand it.”</p><br><p>Adam frowned, trying to get up on his feet, but he couldn’t.</p><br><p>“Tsk… Can’t I just strengthen my body with my energy?”</p><br><p>Misty nodded. “Of course you can, but you’re already doing that right now, aren’t you? You don’t have enough energy to do everything you want to do. Right now, you just need to rest, and we’ll continue later.”</p><br><p>She was about to leave, confident that Adam would pass out from exhaustion in a few seconds.</p><br><br><p>A female voice stopped Misty as she turned to see Silvana, who had appeared behind Adam.</p><br><p>“He has access to my energy, too, doesn’t he? That will be enough.”</p><br><p>Misty was about to argue with her because the Operator’s energy came from the Phantom’s Evolution Tree, and all monsters of her level knew how it worked. It was like borrowing money from yourself.</p><br><p>However, when a bright white flash shone in Adam’s chest, Misty froze in place.</p><br><p>Adam’s energy was not depleted from the limits, but was quickly recovering, at a speed sufficient for Adam to gradually get back on his feet and his Energy Axis to continue rebuilding itself according to his will.</p><br><p>“What do you say?” Adam grinned as he glanced at Silvana. “Am I ready for round two? More accurately, are we ready?”</p><br><p>For a moment, the corners of Misty’s lips turned up in a fleeting smirk.</p><br><p>“Don’t complain later, kid.”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes flashed as his aura burst forth in a powerful stream.</p><br><p>“When did that happen? I’m always ready to fight, even if defeat awaits me!”</p>
