            <br><p>The same memory flashed over and over in Silvana's pale face. She watched Sand Hounds tear Kai apart while Adam just watched from afar.</p><br><p>Moreover, in the end, he didn't even take Kai to a safe place to bury him. He just took the pendant and turned around, letting the Sand Hounds finish what they started.</p><br><p>If Adam was here right now, Silvana would probably yell at him and demand an explanation, but... right now she was here alone.</p><br><p>"Wait... There must be some reason for this... I can't call Adam the kindest person in the world as well as myself, but... he's not a cold-blooded killer." Silvana muttered grabbing her hair.</p><br><p>Watching this memory a few more times, Silvana noticed that Adam's look didn't fit the situation.</p><br><p>If he wanted to kill Kai, he would have either enjoyed the sight like a sadist, or his gaze would be stern and serious like that of an assassin who needed to do his job.</p><br><p>Instead, Silvana saw something else-</p><br><p>"Disappointment...? Is it disappointment? Why is watching the monsters tear Kai apart in Adam's eyes only deep disappointment? How can this be...?" Silvana whispered lowering her gaze downward.</p><br><p>Realizing that the final scene wasn't enough to understand the whole situation, Silvana went back to the very moment Adam and Kai had met.</p><br><p>She could see that Adam just wanted to hand over the pendant and go home, but... a few words were enough for Kai's keen mind to pick up on the inconsistencies and, under threat of suicide, force Adam to reveal the secret way to become a Phantom.</p><br><p>No talent was needed for this, in the appearance of the Spark, yet it was a challenging task since Kai was required to kill the monster as Adam did once before.</p><br><p>Then, they traveled to the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>Even though Silvana was floating in the air, she squatted down, pulled her knees together, and squeezed her shoulders, immersing herself in every second of Adam's memories.</p><br><p>She couldn't hide the fact that seeing Kai's death scene for the first time shook her faith in Adam, however, it was a crack that could disappear as quickly as it appeared.</p><br><p>It was something else.</p><br><br><p>The Sand Hounds killed Kai once more, as Silvana's eyes moved to Adam.</p><br><p>"Is it a misunderstanding or are we too different...?"</p><br><br><p>It was unknown how long Silvana had spent watching the same moment. She saw every detail of that fragment, memorized every word from Adam and Kai, but... she still couldn't find the answer to her question.</p><br><p>She tried to take control of the anxiety growing deep inside her, but gradually it grew bigger and stronger.</p><br><p>"Why...? Why is there disappointment in your gaze? And... why didn't you help him? You're not the kind of person who would just stand by and watch another, innocent person die, right?"</p><br><p>After a few minutes, Silvana's eyes went wide when she had an idea - she decided to take the memories back a few months, going all the way to the moment when Adam became the Phantom.</p><br><p>'Right, their situations were different, but they needed to do the same action to become a Natural Phantom...' Silvana thought for a moment.</p><br><p>She hoped that if she compared the two scenes, Adam and Kai, she would understand why Adam didn't feel compassion for Kai, even though their situations had similarities.</p><br><br><p>A silver thread ran through the man's neck, Phantom's head fell in front of Adam as he faced a one-on-one battle against Silver Weaver.</p><br><p>Unwilling to die, with a fiery gaze full of fear and determination, Adam raised the man's spear and managed to pierce Silver Weaver's chest in his single attack.</p><br><p>Silvana frowned slightly. The first time she saw this memory she didn't pay much attention to it, but... there was something she didn't understand.</p><br><p>"How...? How did you do that?"</p><br><p>However, she wasn't talking about how Adam overcame his fear to fight, but how he was able to lift the Phantom's weapon.</p><br><p>Rubbing her chin thoughtfully, Silvana made an assumption:</p><br><p>"Hmm... That man was already dead, so as soon as his head hit the ground then the energy contact stopped. However, even if there's no energy in this spear, it should still weigh a lot since it's made of genes..."</p><br><p>Silvana realized that Adam had somehow become for a brief period much stronger, and it wasn't just the release of a huge amount of adrenaline, she could feel it.</p><br><p>"Shit... That's not what I should be thinking about at all. I never got to see anything noteworthy."</p><br><br><p>For a long time, Silvana paced from side to side, floating in the air like a ghost. Then, with a heavy sigh, she made a decision not easy for her at all.</p><br><p>"This will probably be a big mistake, but I have no other choice..." Silvana scratched the back of her head, an irritated grimace on her face.</p><br><p>Whoooooooooooosh. Your journey continues with My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Memories came flooding back the moment Adam walked into Kai's house, starting over, but... that was the last time.</p><br><p>"If I can't understand the reason for your disappointment now, then... it means... I'm simply unable to understand how you think and what lurks in your mind."</p><br><p>Her voice was calm, but trembled slightly, showing how nervous she was. She realized that if she couldn't resolve the misunderstanding, Gene Diffusion would most likely fail.</p><br><p>Like all the previous times, Silvana remained attentive, but she already heard every word dozens of times, this was nothing new to her here.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>The monster's claws and fangs dug into Kai's flesh, blood gushing outward bringing his death closer, as well as endless pleas for help.</p><br><p>"Adam! Please help me! I... I was wrong!" Kai exclaimed, unable to get out from under Sand Hound's paws.</p><br><p>"I don't want to be a Phantom! Living one year is better than dying now! Please, Adam!"</p><br><p>"I want to live!" Kai screamed with all his might, the voice coming from the depths of his soul.</p><br><p>Adam slowly turned his head as their gazes met. Then, the monster gave Kai a fatal wound, ending his life in an instant.</p><br><p>Suddenly, Silvana's eyes went wide and her empty pupils grew deeper, filling with meaning.</p><br><p>"Wait... Before the monsters showed up, Kai himself asked Adam not to help him no matter what happened. And... once things got out of control, Kai decided to throw everything away, his dreams, desires, and goal of becoming a Phantom for the sake of surviving..."</p><br><p>Not knowing if she could find the answer or if it was just an illusion, Silvana's gaze went to Adam.</p><br><p>"Tell me... You're not stupid, you realized that he would probably die..."</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip, afraid to continue speaking, but she had already gone too far.</p><br><p>"What would you do if he had continued to fight like you did? What would happen if, instead of pleading for help and giving up his dream, he thrust his teeth like a wild beast into the monster's paw knowing there was no chance of victory?"</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam, who should have walked up to Kai and taken the pendant as he did many times before, raised his head up, staring directly at Silvana.</p><br><p>Her eyes went wide in confusion.</p><br><p>'Agh... Is he looking at me?</p><br><br><p>Adam's cold voice echoed around, making Silvana flinch.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam disappeared, showing up right next to Silvana, memories stopped and the world turned gray, leaving bright colors just for the two of them.</p><br><br><p>Silvana jumped aside, embarrassment reflected on her face.</p><br><p>"Did you see and hear what I was saying the whole time? I thought I was the only one watching your memories!"</p><br><p>In response, Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"This is my space, you know? Of course, I know what goes on here."</p><br><p>Then, he pointed at Kai.</p><br><p>"I thought I couldn't wait for you to finally notice it."</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head as her gaze grew darker. She looked at Adam uncertainly:</p><br><p>"So... Will you answer my other questions? What would you do if he continued to fight?"</p><br><p>With a nonchalant look, Adam just shrugged.</p><br><p>"Sure, I'd save him. You know all about it yourself. He forced me to do it himself and asked me not to help him. Instead of fighting to the last to become a Phantom and forget about this nightmare, he just gave up."</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip as she nodded slightly.</p><br><p>"I get it... That's why you were disappointed."</p><br><p>Adam wanted to ask his question, but... he got his answer before he could even say anything.</p><br><br><p>With a relieved sigh, Silvana smiled weakly, her eyes shining brightly and her face no longer pale like a real ghost.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, space shuddered, shattering everything into a thousand fragments, letting in the vast darkness.</p><br><p>With a bright flash, came the voice of the Evolution Tree:</p><br><p>[Good... You've fully seen and accepted Adam's memories... It's not about what memories... but whether they're suitable for you...]</p><br><p>That was definitely praise and it couldn't help but cause a pleasant warmth in Silvana's chest.</p><br><p>[Now... It's time for part two... Adam isn't the only one with memory crystal...]</p><br><p>For a long time, Silvana completely forgot that after Adam it would be her turn when he would know everything about her as she did to him.</p><br><p>She exclaimed stretching her hand forward:</p><br><p>"Wait! Let us at least talk!"</p><br><p>However... the Evolution Tree had no intention of granting her request. Within seconds, waves of darkness completely engulfed them, causing their minds to fall asleep.</p><br><p>The next time Adam opened his eyes he was standing in the middle of a white hallway, people in the same white robes were walking by in a hurry.</p><br><p>"Oh... Here comes the first difference..."</p><br><p>Adam muttered realizing that he was in a city hospital, in a labor ward.</p>
