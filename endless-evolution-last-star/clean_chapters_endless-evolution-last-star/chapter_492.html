            <br><p>Just now, Adam finished one of the most difficult challenges of his life, even though it had nothing to do with the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>"Damn... I didn't even realize it was so hard! Do I have such crooked hands that even with the instructions and prepared parts I could barely manage it?" Adam muttered, grasping his hands on his head irritably.</p><br><p>He hadn't rested once since he started assembling the bracelet, as he was fully engaged in the process.</p><br><p>Sure, his stamina was too high to make his body tired from such a thing, but mentally it was quite difficult, as at some points he was failing a lot.</p><br><p>But... despite all the struggles, there was a satisfied smile on Adam's face, he was happy with the result.</p><br><p>"Well, well, maybe some artist or craftsman would have made something more impressive out of these details, but that's the point, right? Imperfection creates uniqueness."</p><br><p>Adam smirked, looking at the bracelet and slowly rotating it in his hands.</p><br><p>Adam concentrated all his efforts on the main part of the bracelet, or rather on the pattern in the middle that he gathered from many parts.</p><br><p>It was a snow-white wave, it passed to the center of the bracelet before breaking into many white, gray, and black particles.</p><br><p>Thus, the left side of the wave was smooth and simple, while the right side was shattered and sharp, creating a contrast not only in the color palette between white and black but also between the wave types.</p><br><p>Then, Adam looked at the time.</p><br><p>He didn't know when Silvana was due back, but it was already quite late.</p><br><p>'Hah, I'm lucky Silvana decided to be late today, otherwise I wouldn't finish in time. That would be a failure!' Adam smiled, thinking that it was luck.</p><br><p>Although, Silvana had purposely sat in the spectator room for as long as possible.</p><br><p>Step. Step. Step. Enjoy new stories from empire</p><br><p>A few minutes later, unnaturally loud footsteps sounded down the hallway, as if whoever was heading for the room wanted to be heard clearly.</p><br><p>Adam didn't pay much attention to this oddity, as he could only think of one thing at that moment: 'Oh, it's Silvana! Right, I've got everything ready, so the important thing is to get it right.' Adam gathered his thoughts and quickly hid all the tools in a box and placed the box under the table, in the very corner.</p><br><p>He left only the bracelet, which he hid behind his back, holding it tightly with both hands like a most valuable treasure.</p><br><p>Sure, Silvana already knew what awaited her, but she wasn't going to pretend that she had any idea about it.</p><br><p>It was going to be a surprise, it wasn't Adam's fault that she decided to come back here in the middle of the day though that wasn't in her plans.</p><br><p>"Hello, are you still awake?" Silvana said, walking leisurely into the room.</p><br><p>Then, she waved her palm over her forehead demonstratively, as if she was wiping off sweat after a long workout.</p><br><p>Well, she had actually been practicing with Riska, but they spent most of their time discussing how Silvana should behave tonight.</p><br><p>It was important to her, she couldn't help it and brought it up time after time.</p><br><p>"No, I wanted to lie down a little later. I had a pretty free day today, so I'm not too tired." Adam shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>Silvana looked at him, then her gaze moved to his hands clasped behind his back.</p><br><p>A plan of action immediately appeared in her mind.</p><br><p>"Oh, what is it you're hiding in there? Something important?" Silvana smirked as she bit her pinky finger.</p><br><p>She narrowed her eyes and tried to look cool, but it was only an outer mask.</p><br><p>'Damn it! What did I just say? Doesn't it show that I know he has something prepared for me? God! How stupid am I!'</p><br><p>Adam got an embarrassed look on his face. He too, was dealing with an internal monologue similar to what Silvana was experiencing right now.</p><br><p>'Hah, I probably should hide the bracelet instead of holding it with both hands like a fool... Well, I don't have any other choice anymore anyway. I have to say everything right now.'</p><br><p>Then, Adam nodded slightly with a shy smile on his face.</p><br><p>"Yeah, you got me... Anyway, I want to give you something."</p><br><p>Adam gulped as he took a step forward and displayed the bracelet, on his palms in front of Silvana's gaze.</p><br><p>"Hmm... How interesting, is it a bracelet?" Silvana said in an arrogant voice, evaluating Adam's gift.</p><br><p>Her face remained calm and cold, but inside her raged a true flame.</p><br><p>'Argh! Of course, it's a bracelet! What kind of stupid questions are you asking? Stop acting like an arrogant bitch!'</p><br><p>Adam wanted to say something, but before the first words came off his lips, Silvana took a step forward.</p><br><p>At the same time, her mask shattered into tiny shards as a kind smile passed across her face, quickly filling with bright emotions.</p><br><p>"Oh, what an unusual pattern... Where did you buy such an unusual bracelet?" Silvana muttered, though she already knew the answer to that question.</p><br><p>She slowly slipped the bracelet onto her hand, looking at her wrist with a gentle gaze.</p><br><p>Adam smiled weakly, scratching the back of his head, he replied: "Well, don't worry about it. I just saw it and decided to buy it, no big deal. Hahaha. It seemed like it would suit your style."</p><br><p>The awkwardness of both of them could be felt directly, they were both acting weird but trying to keep it sincere.</p><br><p>Adam tried not to talk about the price or the difficulty of assembly and Silvana about the fact that it wasn't a surprise to her because she knew about it beforehand.</p><br><p>Adam's main goal was to please Silvana and to see her sincere joy. Silvana didn't want to upset Adam, because she realized he was working hard and doing it only for her.</p><br><p>The first one to give up was Silvana...</p><br><br><p>Warm tears flowed down her delicate skin, falling from her cheek one by one, crashing on the metal bracelet whose value was not at all in its high price.</p><br><p>Adam shuddered, goosebumps running down his body.</p><br><p>He saw Silvana's tears before, but this situation was different.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry... I ruined everything..." Silvana whispered as the tears rushed from her eyes with renewed force.</p><br><p>Adam didn't understand what to do or how he felt.</p><br><p>Silvana's tears... they were unique just like the bracelet on her wrist, her tears combined both genuine happiness and regret at the same time.</p>
