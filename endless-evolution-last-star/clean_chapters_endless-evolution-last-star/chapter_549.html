            <br><p>Mariel felt better than ever, her mind at peace, her child was back and not angry at her.
</p><br><p>She wanted this moment to last forever, to rest her head on Baren’s shoulder, her eyes closed and breathing slowly.
</p><br><p>But, Mariel realized that a few short seconds was all she could afford in the current situation.
</p><br><p>After all, Baren showed up at the most complicated moment. Adam’s appearance, Gladius’s reveal, and his defense of Adam, then Istrid’s attack and the way Baren’s fly-in stopped her.
</p><br><p>None of this made the situation any easier, and no matter what happened, they as nobles couldn’t ignore The Rule of Power, especially when Osana already supported Adam. Their intentions were clear.
</p><br><p>"What...? What did you say? You came here to save Osana?" Mariel gasped, taking a step back from shock. Explore more stories at Freewebnovel
</p><br><p>Baren nodded deeply before turning to Osana and waving at her as if they had just met on the street and he was calling her to him.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, I found out she’s having a wedding today and decided that it’s definitely not what Osana would want, she has a spunky and challenging personality, doesn’t she? Hahaha!"
</p><br><p>Baren laughed briefly.
</p><br><p>’Well... who’s to say...’
</p><br><p>Mariel inwardly took a deep breath.
</p><br><p>Zarot’s eyes were running from side to side, the guests were looking at each other since they didn’t understand what was going on there.
</p><br><p>Baren voiced his intentions, but that was not the point.
</p><br><p>Even though Baren came out of nowhere, destroying the banquet hall, he behaved comfortably and naturally, as if everything was meant to be that way.
</p><br><p>The guests felt like they were the extra ones here, not Baren, their minds had a hard time accepting that.
</p><br><br><p>Zarot stepped forward, his gaze becoming menacing, he realized it was time to take control of the situation.
</p><br><p>"I’m afraid that’s impossible."
</p><br><p>Baren turned around, with a kind expression on his face, he asked: "Why not? As far as I can see they haven’t exchanged rings as well as vows yet, which means they are not husband and wife." Baren spread his hands apart.
</p><br><p>Zarot narrowed his eyes, clenching his fists tightly.
</p><br><p>"No, you’re too late. And... are you going to accomplish your goal by force?"
</p><br><p>Toward the end, Zarot’s voice grew darker.
</p><br><p>Baren turned around, about to reply something.
</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, an explosion of darkness erupted behind him, rocks flying off to the sides, some hitting the guests, making their faces contort in vivid pain.
</p><br><p>"Fuck... Nirosh, you’re really out of luck..." Istrid muttered, climbing out from under the pieces of metal from the main chandelier.
</p><br><p>Crystal dust flew down her shoulders while she slowly stood up, lifting part of the deformed chandelier on her shoulders.
</p><br><br><p>Istrid swung her arm sharply, pushing the multi-ton chandelier aside, the metal hoops sinking into the ground, leaving deep marks on the stone floor.
</p><br><p>"Baren De Rouzet, or should I call you Baren Haltz?"
</p><br><p>In response, Baren only shrugged nonchalantly.
</p><br><p>"As you wish, I’m not one to take offense at such trivialities."
</p><br><p>A trickle of blood flowed from Istrid’s mouth corner, she closed her lips before spitting out a clot of dark blood on the ground and wiping the bloody mark on her face.
</p><br><p>"Why? Why did you decide to protect that bastard?!" Istrid exclaimed pointing at Adam, who was still standing in the same spot a few meters away from her.
</p><br><p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.
</p><br><p>Baren scratched the back of his head, with a bemused expression, it was clear from his look that he didn’t understand what Istrid was talking about.
</p><br><p>"Damn, why does everyone have so many questions for me? Didn’t I already tell you why I came here? I don’t even know who this young man is. The fact that I saved him is just a coincidence."
</p><br><p>Then, Baren blinked a few times and tilted his head.
</p><br><p>"Wait... Why did you attack him during the wedding ceremony? Now that’s interesting."
</p><br><p>Oddly enough, it wasn’t Istrid who decided to answer his question.
</p><br><p>Osana stepped forward, staring intently at her brother, her posture was calm and confident.
</p><br><p>"Brother, this young man’s name is Adam Vinter, and he came here as my fiancé."
</p><br><p>Baren’s eyes instantly traveled to Adam’s right hand, seeing the wedding ring on his finger.
</p><br><p>He didn’t jump to any premature conclusions, but in his mind, a picture of what was happening here was slowly forming.
</p><br><br><p>’No, something’s wrong.’ Baren internally muttered, ’From the looks of it, he’s not a high noble, he’s not a noble at all, he’s just an ordinary Phantom. Even if they were actually going to get married, it’s not enough for the elders in the families to cancel a wedding between two high nobles.’
</p><br><p>Baren rubbed his chin thoughtfully.
</p><br><p>’Something is missing, some important detail...’
</p><br><p>Osana’s corners of her lips went up slightly, she seemed to understand what Baren was thinking and that was to her advantage.
</p><br><p>"Istrid attacked Adam because he used The Rule of Power. It was the only way to save me from the captivity of the Marzo Family. Istrid wanted to kill him, but you showed up at just the right moment."
</p><br><p>Then, Osana cast a cold glance at Gladius, her eyes were as sharp as blades.
</p><br><p>Gladius gave a silly smile, unlike her, he knew that nothing would happen to Adam.
</p><br><p>"Oh, The Rule of Power... So that’s why Zarot said I was late. Hah, looks like that’s true." Baren chuckled, realizing that he didn’t have time to save his sister because Adam already did it.
</p><br><br><p>Baren stepped forward and glanced at Istrid.
</p><br><p>"So... now it’s my time to ask questions. Are you still going to kill him? Do you want to kill Adam Vinter so he can’t use The Rule of Power?"
</p><br><p>Istrid frowned, staring intently at Baren.
</p><br><br><p>Baren shrugged with a calm look.
</p><br><p>"Well, then I’ll have to help my sister’s future husband a little. I’ll show him that the traditions and ancient laws of the higher nobles must be honored, absolutely everyone must do it."
</p><br><p>Istrid blinked, her eyes going wide since Baren was already standing right in front of her.
</p><br><p>His hand was covered in thick, pink energy, heading straight for her in the shortest trajectory possible like a deadly blade.
</p><br><p>Istrid instinctively stepped back, she had to get out of striking range.
</p><br><br><p>Streams of blood rushed from her left arm, no... from the open wound on her shoulder left after Baren’s palm sliced off her arm.
</p><br><br><p>Baren grabbed Istrid’s left arm by the wrist and threw it to the side with all his might, the arm slamming into the wall at breakneck speed, shattering into a bloody mess.</p>
