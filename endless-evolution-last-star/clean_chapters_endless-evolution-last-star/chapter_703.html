            <br><p>The Blind Commander hoped to get back into the fight with his leaps, but his opponent was ready for it.</p><br><p>Moreover, Adam wasn't going to let The Blind Commander back onto the platform, he was going to win right here and now.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The crimson energy flowed through his body, while purple flames ran through the two rings.</p><br><p>Neither Silvana, nor Blind Commander, knew what Adam's new Nexus was about, what its rings possessed, yet it was no great secret to the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>[Oh... The crimson rings bring destructive power to your hands.... but... things are a little different now... isn't it?]</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes sparkled as his hands headed forward directly towards the Blind Commander who was still in the air.</p><br><p>He aimed to grab the Blind Commander's legs, but at the last moment, the Blind Commander created a wall of ice between them, not to protect himself but to use it as a base for retreat.</p><br><p>Without wasting a second, the Blind Commander leaped forward, flying right over Adam, soon finding himself in the center of the platform.</p><br><p>His ice sword was still in his hand, in a tight grip, emitting streams of cold, frosty vapor.</p><br><p>The monster stared intently at Adam, sensing a natural menace from him despite his heavy wounds.</p><br><br><p>Clots of dark blood crashed to the ground, dripping off the Blind Commander's bandages around his head.</p><br><p>Silvana thought that after a direct blow to the head, the Blind Commander had already lost, but that didn't happen. However, it didn't change the fact that Adam's punch was really powerful.</p><br><p>Trying to think of a plan of action, the Blind Commander glanced around, but soon returned his gaze to Adam, afraid that he would attack again.</p><br><p>However, for some reason, Adam was still standing on the platform's edge, as if he didn't need to get too close to his opponent.</p><br><p>Soon, echoed Adam's menacing voice:</p><br><p>"Hey, I don't know what you're thinking, but I want only victory." Stomp.</p><br><p>With full confidence, Adam stepped forward like a shadow soon finding himself in front of Blind Commander.</p><br><p>Nothing seemed to change, Adam was still as fast as ever, but the Blind Commander wasn't naive enough to believe it.</p><br><p>He felt that the purple flames on the rings would get him into a lot of trouble.</p><br><br><p>A tightly clenched fist headed towards the Blind Commander's chest. Immediately, the monster put his sword out in front of him, going to block Adam's attack just as he had done dozens of times before.</p><br><p>Yet, something was different now.</p><br><p>Instead of Adam's fist becoming more powerful to maximize the impact, it slowly unfolded itself.</p><br><p>Before the Blind Commander could realize anything, Adam's fist turned into a palm held forward like a sharp blade.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam's expression changed from an excited one to a calm one, as if he was following the mode of his new Nexus.</p><br><p>In the second mode, he didn't have to fight like a savage warrior and destroy everything in his path.</p><br><p>It was a more elegant, no... more professional if he was a real weaver.</p><br><p>A bright purple flash reflected on the Blind Commander's face as a tiny star appeared on the tip of Adam's middle finger.</p><br><p>Then, the energy from the star covered the tips of the rest of his fingers, turning into a dense, bright line of white energy with a purple hue.</p><br><p>Adam's cold eyes went upward, looking at the monster's tattered bandages, as if believing that somewhere behind them were hidden eyes as well.</p><br><p>"I have only your legs left to strike, but.... how could I resist such an opportunity?" Whoooooooosh.</p><br><p>Adam swung his palm sharply from top to bottom, despite the lightning speed his movements seemed smooth and even slow, as if he was in no hurry.</p><br><p>A white line with purple edges radiating like mist arose in front of the Blind Commander, floating serenely in the air.</p><br><br><p>The cold vapor came out of Adam's mouth as his two rings shone brightly.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the white line shuddered before shrinking to a complete disappearance.</p><br><br><p>Thick streams of blood rushed from the right side of the Blind Commander's body.</p><br><p>A perfectly even cut, as if made not on his flesh but on space, appeared on his shoulder, arm, torso, and leg, all on one side.</p><br><p>It wasn't some quick, weak attack that couldn't be dodged, it carried serious damage.</p><br><p>The white line couldn't cut the Blind Commander's bones, but it made them crack, and everything in the way, flesh and blood were separated, revealing a view of the snow-white bones.</p><br><p>Apparently, at that point, Adam passed the Blind Commander's challenge, as part of the cut landed on the monster's leg, which was the last of the three strikes.</p><br><p>Yet, Adam wasn't going to stop there. He was going to show everything he was capable of with his new Nexus. Experience tales at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><br><p>With full confidence in his actions in his gaze, Adam jumped back when his rings shook again.</p><br><p>His energy was coming to an end, even considering that he was no longer a true K2W0-Phantom but a much stronger one, his Nexus was of an even higher level.</p><br><p>This was both his reward and punishment for what his desires did with the Two Walls.</p><br><p>'Even if it's my last attack, with the help of runes and fortress, I'll be able to recover. I don't know what the Blind Commander will do now, but I can't take any chances. I have to pass on right now.'</p><br><p>Earlier, the Blind Commander had already tried to kill Adam. Actually, Adam didn't believe that the Blind Commander would change his mind, but the monster didn't expect to be injured so seriously.</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..."</p><br><p>The Blind Commander breathed heavily before raising his head and looking at Adam standing ten meters away from him, not far from a powerful stream of blue flame.</p><br><p>For some reason, Adam's rings now had two different colors, as well as the veil waves running down his body.</p><br><p>Images of Adam's past attacks quickly appeared in the Blind Commander's mind, trying to figure out what awaited him this time.</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree knew the answer, reading it from Adam's gaze.</p><br><p>[Well... well... He's finally getting closer to where he started... The Phantom's path is changing me... and all the components of his powers force... but... it works both ways...]</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Initial Gene sitting at the center of the Evolution Tree trembled slightly as if to confirm its words.</p><br><p>[Yeah... It's unlikely that Adam will ever follow the path of his first monster.... but... his desires aren't much different.]</p><br><p>The evolution Tree, Silvana, and the Blind Commander surely realized one thing about Adam's new Nexus: While his rings were in crimson flame, his melee attacks received a powerful destructive force, not only physical but energy as well. His first attack created an explosion that left a serious wound on the Blind Commander's stomach.</p><br><p>The crimson rings were in aggressive mode.</p><br><p>While his rings were in purple flame, the hard and brutal attacks changed to precise but deadly cuts, they possessed even more piercing power than Adam's needle but required more time, the right conditions, and energy.</p><br><p>The purple rings were a calm mode.</p><br><p>But, what was supposed to happen when Adam activated the two powers at the same time?</p><br><p>Was it possible to combine them at all?</p><br><br><p>Staring intently at the Blind Commander, Adam put his hands out in front of him, the purple ring at the top, while the crimson one was at the bottom.</p><br><p>His arms were tightly locked together down to his wrists, his palms spread slightly apart like an open beast's jaw, picking its target to devour.</p><br><br><p>A powerful stream of energy traveled down Adam's arms, causing crimson blobs of energy next to the confused Blind Commander.</p><br><p>Realizing that he was surrounded and that a powerful blast was likely waiting for him, the Blind Commander thrust his sword into the ground, channeling down the cold energy.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The platform shuddered as massive blocks of ice appeared around the Blind Commander, trying to protect him from any impending threat.</p><br><p>It was not a lone wall, but a dome protecting its master on all sides.</p><br><p>Well, something the Blind Commander was wrong about, Adam wasn't going to blow him up, that wasn't the point of his abilities and never was.</p><br><p>At high speed, the crimson clots dispersed into a vast cloud surrounding the Blind Commander, as if the weather decided to unleash its wrath on him alone.</p><br><p>Then, Adam's eyes flashed purple, and similar particles appeared in the cloud.</p><br><p>Compared to the crimson cloud, they were very few, just a tiny fraction, but they represented a major force.</p><br><p>Slash. Slash. Slash.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, each purple particle turned into a white blade, rapidly increasing in size and descending upon the Blind Commander.</p><br><p>Back then, no one believed that the ice was capable of protecting the monster, not Adam, not Silvana, not Blind Commander himself.</p><br><p>He just watched as hundreds of blades sliced apart everything in their path.</p>
