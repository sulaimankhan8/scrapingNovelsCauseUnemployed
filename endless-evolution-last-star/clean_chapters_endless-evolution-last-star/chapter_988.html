            <br><br><p>Risha's fists rained down on Adam in a dangerous hail of blows. He easily dodged each attack, he could see her movements.</p><br><p>In fact, they were both moving rather slowly.</p><br><p>An experienced military man would have been able to keep track of their moves and even block some of the blows.</p><br><p>But how was that possible?</p><br><p>Well, as Adam suggested, the last three days they spent almost all their time fighting against each other in the dark field.</p><br><p>The intense pressure kept them from moving too fast, but it was great progress.</p><br><p>The first time Risha was at the Magma Plateau, she couldn't even reach the center where Adam was lying.</p><br><p>It was also a difficult task for Adam. With only three gates open, it would be a big challenge for him to stand up straight without feeling pain.</p><br><p>Yet, Risha was doing it, her legs shaking, but her hands were clenched tightly into fists.</p><br><p>She was trying to hit Adam, though he had a strong advantage, he was much stronger.</p><br><p>Apparently, their goal was to help Risha open the fourth lesser gate, but they couldn't make any progress.</p><br><p>"FUCK!!!!" Risha exclaimed furiously when an axe appeared in her hand.</p><br><p>In a wide swing, she brought the massive weapon down directly on Adam, throwing all her anger at him.</p><br><br><p>Adam pulled his hand up, stopping Risha's axe halfway through. Energy filled his hand, while the tightly woven threads offered protection.</p><br><p>"Alright, that's enough for today. We have two more days before the Light Legion arrives and Heret's plan goes into effect," Adam said calmly, though he realized it couldn't please Risha.</p><br><p>Risha gritted her teeth. "No! Adam, there is no way I can defeat Kreyna at this rate! You stopped my attack with one hand! Kreyna is not weaker than you! She'll just kill me if I don't open the fourth lesser gates."</p><br><br><p>Adam didn't know what to say to her.</p><br><p>Sure, he had opened the fourth lesser gates, but they had different situations. The ways that worked for him could be disastrous for Risha.</p><br><p>"Shit, let's fight seriously! Attack me! Use your abilities like you did against Heret and Vorx! Don't stop hitting me while I can breathe!" she clenched her fist, warlike flames blazing in her gaze.</p><br><p>However... Adam only shook his head.</p><br><p>"No, we don't have time for you to recover from something like that. What's more, it won't help you."</p><br><p>Risha was outraged. "WHY? Vorx and Heret practically killed you! Then, you got up and easily dealt with both of them!"</p><br><p>"Well, I just felt like it would get me to the right place. Then, I heard my Evolution Tree and figured out what the point of my fourth lesser gates was.</p><br><p>"Over these three days, I've asked you many times what your plan is. Until now, you didn't appear to have an answer, did you?"</p><br><p>A shiver ran through Risha, causing her to take a step back.</p><br><p>"You don't know what your fourth lesser gates want. You don't know what you want."</p><br><p>Then, Adam turned around, leaving the dark field.</p><br><p>His hand fell on her shoulder, reassuringly.</p><br><p>"Our sparring has lost its original effectiveness. Now, you have only two choices. Either deal with the essence of your gate now or do it during the fight against Kreyna. You like to fight, so... it might work."</p><br><p>Even though Adam did the same thing against Vorx, there was no confidence in his voice.</p><br><p>Adam walked out of the Magma Plateau, leaving Risha alone, alone with her thoughts. She wanted to chase him down and make him fight on, but she realized it was pointless.</p><br><p>"Damn it! Why does everyone else get it right and I don't?!" she exclaimed, throwing her arms out to the sides.</p><br><p>Risha walked out of the dark field, just walking in a circle. She mumbled something under her breath with great grimace, the stream of complaints seemed to be endless.</p><br><p>"He went to battle and won! Two needles? Pffft!" Risha snorted, kicking a stone. "If I had such a cool first order, I could easily do it too. You'd pick two different needles when you have one!"</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage's calm voice echoed in her mind.</p><br><p>'Well, it's always easy to talk when the event has already happened. Instead of complaining, you should listen to his words and your desires. What would you wish for from your fourth lesser gates?'</p><br><p>"Shut up! How would I know? If I knew, I would have done it a long time ago!" Risha waved her hand irritably, sitting down on the rock. "Or what are you suggesting I do? Instead of three claws, should I get four? Or maybe I want to roar like a beast because that's what all my abilities are related to?"</p><br><p>Radiant Mirage nodded as he opened his mouth. He liked one of the ideas.</p><br><p>"No. It's all bullshit!" Risha shouted, leaving Radiant Mirage speechless.</p><br><br><p>'Fuck... She's hopeless,' he gulped in genuine fear. 'Who did I choose to be my partner? She's going to kill us both!'</p><br><p>Risha couldn't calm down, this whole situation irritated her to the core.</p><br><p>"Adam..." she wheezed. "He helped me, I'm grateful to him, but... at times like this, I just want to take my fist and smash it right into his face to erase his smirk!"</p><br><p>Then, she raised the stone, piercing it with her gaze like a mortal enemy.</p><br><p>"And, that Kreyna... I haven't even seen her once, but she's already become my biggest problem! I swear, when I see her, no matter how strong she is, I'll just tear that bitch apart! I'll crush her at all costs!" she roared, clutching the rock tightly.</p><br><p>The debris flew off to the sides while dust passed through her fingers.</p><br><p>One move, and it was over.</p><br><p>"Wait..." Risha muttered. "Claws? An axe? Why do I need all this...? If I want to crush her in one swipe, I need something faster and more powerful... Grip into her throat like a bear with its jaw..."</p><br><p>A gleam passed through Risha's eyes.</p><br><p>Not right away, but an idea came to her, the first one.</p>
