            <h4>Chapter 1520: Blood Bite</h4><br><p>Silvana was not as reckless as Adam. She preferred to prepare for missions and follow a plan rather than take risks at every turn.
</p><br><p>There was nothing wrong with that. The Phantom and Operator did not have to be clones of each other. They could be different people and even have opposing opinions on many issues.
</p><br><p>But one thing always remained true: the Phantom paved the way, while his Operator supported him.
</p><br><p>It is unknown what would have happened if Adam and Silvana had switched places. Perhaps Adam would have become a calmer and more pragmatic person. Who knows?
</p><br><p>Now, Silvana was getting closer and closer to what Adam was like at the beginning of his path. When he first became a Phantom, he was not yet accustomed to bloody battles and the risks on which everything often depended, but he felt pleasure from the battles, from the victories, and from the slight recklessness that had grown significantly since then.
</p><br><p>Sure, Silvana was still far from the Adam she knew now. It was unlikely that she would ever reach that level, but there was no need for that.
</p><br><p>All that had happened now was that they had both taken the next step forward.
</p><br><p>Adam took another risk and was proven right.
</p><br><p>He got the Ancient Flux, and Silvana couldn’t deny that this power, this risk they both took, made her heart beat faster than ever.
</p><br><p>"You defeated that golem, didn’t you?" Silvana licked her lips after a deep kiss.
</p><br><br><p>"Of course I am." He turned to the Evolution Tree. "I don’t know what was going on here, but I’m sure you were panicking. Hahaha!"
</p><br><p>Silvana didn’t answer. Instead, she turned Adam’s gaze to herself and kissed him again without warning.
</p><br><p>However, instead of pleasure, Adam’s face reflected a mixture of sharp pain and surprise.
</p><br><br><p>He jerked his head back, looking at Silvana. The corner of her mouth was now bloody, while a trickle of blood flowed from Adam’s mouth.
</p><br><p>"What are you..." Adam was caught off guard. He had never seen Silvana like this before.
</p><br><p>In response, she just smirked.
</p><br><p>"Tsk, I wanted to bite a piece out of you. That’s for making me so nervous! The Evolution Tree almost broke!"
</p><br><p>Adam brushed his mouth as he glanced to the side.
</p><br><p>"Well, even if everything is as you say, everything is fine now, isn’t it?"
</p><br><p>Silvana sighed deeply. She couldn’t deny it.
</p><br><p>"Yeah... Something like that, but I’m still mad at you, okay?"
</p><br><p>"Hah, I already noticed that. If you had said that before biting off half my lip, I would have dodged in time."
</p><br><p>Silvana puffed out her cheeks. "Hey! I just bit you lightly! Damn, why can’t you just enjoy the moment and play along?"
</p><br><p>"Oh, I am enjoying the moment. Do you really think I’m teasing you for no reason?"
</p><br><p>Pure fury filled Silvana’s eyes as she lunged at Adam, ready to show him that he shouldn’t mess with her.
</p><br><p>But, at the last moment, Adam’s frame disappeared as he found himself high above, right in front of the Ancient Flux.
</p><br><p>Silvana took a deep breath, shook her head, and headed toward him. Playtime was over, they had to move on, but first, they both had to look at the Ancient Flux, at the new part of their power.
</p><br><br><p>She appeared behind Adam, putting her hand on his shoulder as their eyes momentarily stared at the purple rift full of ancient energy.
</p><br><p>"So now you have two energy types, right?"
</p><br><p>Adam nodded, staring at the gray-purple energy as if spellbound. He had seen it before, but his encounter with the Head Golem had lasted only a fraction of a second. Now, he had time to contemplate its majesty.
</p><br><p>"Yes. I’ve already used it, but I don’t know what else this power is capable of. Probably a lot, but..."
</p><br><br><p>In response, Adam pointed to the Ancient Flux.
</p><br><p>"Look, it’s empty. I’m sure when it first appeared, not only the edges glowed brightly, right?"
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam was right.
</p><br><p>"Wait." Silvana blinked. "Are you saying that you only had enough energy to create one barrier that lasted only a few moments?"
</p><br><p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.
</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head. For some reason, he felt awkward admitting it.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, something like that. I don’t feel weak, but it’s like when I first became a Phantom and was ready to shut down if I used my Nexus more than twice in a row.
</p><br><p>"The ancient energy is a powerful tool, but it’s quite limited, at least for now."
</p><br><p>A few moments later, Silvana buried her nose in his back, looking over his shoulder at the Ancient Flux.
</p><br><p>"It’s time to do this, right? It’s time for you to move on, but we need to learn more about this."
</p><br><p>Adam nodded. He knew what she was talking about as the next moment they both stepped forward, reaching out their hands to the Ancient Flux.
</p><br><p>The rift trembled but did not resist, and the gray-purple flows ran through their fingers, making their eyes shine brightly.
</p><br><br><p>The source of the ancient energy that is now part of your Evolution Tree, your path. You can use it as you wish, just like the star energy, but be vigilant... it is a power that even monsters who have lived for several hundred years are not always able to withstand. This is energy that has its own will, unlike a simple echo from the collision of two great stars.]
</p><br><p>It was not much, but it allowed Adam to learn more about the ancient energy. When he returns to the Citadel, he will ask Damien many questions and try to learn as much as possible about this power.
</p><br><p>"Hey, I have to go back. I still need to destroy the barrier." Adam turned to Silvana as his face froze.
</p><br><p>Silvana’s eyes were wide open as the ancient energy enveloped her, slowly filling her mind.
</p><br><p>This time, the changes would affect not only Adam but also his companion.</p>
