            <h4>Chapter 1062: Good Offer?</h4><br><p>As always, the time of jokes and pleasant chats around the table was coming to an end. Though, in this case, they didn’t get to the main course yet.
</p><br><p>Saegar treated them to wine, and after a few irrelevant questions, asked what was important.
</p><br><p>"This... I ended up at the Dark Shore not by my will. I think it’s obvious to everyone here that a creature of my level has no place here," Adam said a little worriedly.
</p><br><p>"Hmm, yeah, you’re right about that. No offense, Adam, but Kenward and I could crush you to the ground with one finger like a worm."
</p><br><p>Silvana, who was listening intently to their conversation, frowned heavily.
</p><br><p>Sure, Kenward wasted no opportunity to show how big the difference in their strength was, but Saegar was doing it in a much more aggressive way.
</p><br><br><p>Saegar clapped his hands as three maids stepped forward, placing a dish in front of each.
</p><br><p>In Adam’s case he was greeted by a large piece of meat, juicy with a toasted crust. For Saegar it was a bunch of grapes and for Kenward... it was a chocolate dessert.
</p><br><p>"Help yourself. I’m sure after you went through the black flash, you lost a lot of energy, didn’t you?"
</p><br><p>Adam flinched. He didn’t mention the black flash, though it was no surprise that Saegar guessed it right.
</p><br><p>"So..." Saegar popped a grape into his mouth as he glanced at Kenward. "You helped him through the dark route, and you ended up on my territory. It’s kind of a shame."
</p><br><p>Saegar leaned on his arm, looking off into the distance.
</p><br><p>"There was a Twilight Crystal on my lands for a while, and I didn’t know about it. Damn! Adam, you’re making me jealous."
</p><br><br><p>Kenward tapped a tiny spoon on the edge of his plate.
</p><br><p>"Stop torturing him. You figured it out a long time ago. I’m sure you’ve already got some decent offers in your head."
</p><br><p>Then, Kenward’s eyes narrowed, piercing Saegar’s smirk with his sharp gaze.
</p><br><p>"You’re not just going to kill him, are you?"
</p><br><br><p>Saegar theatrically put his palm to his chest, looking up.
</p><br><p>"How could you think I was capable of such a savage act? Furthermore..." his tone became lower. "If I kill him now, my men won’t be able to find the Twilight Crystal in time, it will simply disappear. That would be a great loss."
</p><br><p>Then, the corners of his lips curved upward.
</p><br><p>"Just kidding! Adam, I won’t kill you for another reason. Only subordinates of the Befallen Crown are capable of killing humans for no reason, without even trying to make a profit from it. You know, you’re lucky the Twilight Crystal is in my territory, I’m open to negotiation."
</p><br><br><p>He couldn’t tell when Saegar was joking and when he was serious. Attempts to follow Saegar’s facial expressions and movements were unsuccessful.
</p><br><p>"And... What possible benefit to you in this?" Adam asked.
</p><br><p>Saegar leaned forward, his fingertips touching each other in a cunning posture.
</p><br><p>"Well... I get the show. The mid-sized Twilight Crystal will be of no use to me, unlike my subordinates. You know." Saegar waved his hand, pointing to the maids and Valdris. "I’m trying to be a good leader. So, we’ll make a contest out of your Twilight Crystal! The trial with the top prize!"
</p><br><p>Did Adam like that offer?
</p><br><p>He didn’t know all the details yet, but he certainly wasn’t surprised. A few minutes with Saegar were enough to expect something like this from him.
</p><br><p>Noticing Adam’s pale face, Saegar rolled his eyes. "Come on. It’s a lot better than if I just kill you. Let’s approach this matter fairly. The Twilight Crystal is yours, but it’s on my territory so I’m entitled to a piece of it.
</p><br><p>"But, sharing the Twilight Crystal won’t work, so you and my men will compete for it. The Twilight Crystal will go to the strongest! Simple as that!"
</p><br><br><p>Kenward tapped the plate again. "Bring some more. That one was delicious. You’re right, Saegar, your maids are quite good, unlike you."
</p><br><br><p>Adam turned to Kenward.
</p><br><p>"What do you think?"
</p><br><br><p>"I hate to say it, but it’s actually not a bad offer. You won’t get a better one."
</p><br><p>"Of course!" Saegar crossed his arms over his chest. "I’m an honorable Lord!"
</p><br><p>"But..." Adam stammered as he glanced at Valdris. "What chance do I have against a monster of his level? If it’s a trial, I’ll just die in the first minute..."
</p><br><p>In response, Saegar gave him a wide grin.
</p><br><p>"Hah, Adam, do you think I would try to trick you in such a cheap way? Surely neither Valdris nor any other monsters close to his level will be competing with you. What will come out against you is the younger generation, just like you!"
</p><br><p>After saying that, Saegar stood up and walked to the balcony of his temple. He had a view of the Soaring Chain Islands, where only a small portion of the monsters were equal to the wing warriors.
</p><br><p>The monsters that led Valdris met Kenward and Adam at the entrance were the elite. They were among the strongest.
</p><br><p>"Let’s say..." Saegar rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "I think I can recruit twenty fighters who are at the same level as you. Hm, you Phantoms refer to that level as the Red Threat."
</p><br><p>’I have to admit, this deal is getting better and better by the minute.’ Silvana’s voice broke out in Adam’s head.
</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly.
</p><br><p>’Yeah. I’d love it if the Twilight Crystal would show up on Kenward’s lands, but I have to play my best card. If the crystal were at the Sacrificial Waterfalls, the plan would be over.’
</p><br><p>"What do you say, Adam?" Saegar turned around.
</p><br><p>Adam bit his lip, mulling over his options.
</p><br><p>"I only have one question."
</p><br><br><p>"It’s going to be a trial. Your monsters and I will be hunting for the Twilight Crystal. Thus, do I have the right to kill them?"
</p><br><p>Saegar’s eyes narrowed into slits as darkness covered his frame leaving only the light from his amber eyes visible along with a devious smirk.
</p><br><p>"Sure. If they die at the hands of a pathetic, lost K3-Phantom, they deserve it."</p>
