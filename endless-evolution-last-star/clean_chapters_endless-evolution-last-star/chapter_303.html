            <br><p>A multitude of threads gathered in a silver sphere between Adam's hands, under his calm gaze, somewhat pensive and somewhat serene.</p><br><p>He had to concentrate on killing the Thunder Demon, but since the others needed time to prepare, he could allow his thoughts some freedom.</p><br><p>Oskar looked at Adam's silver orb with a serious look before stepping forward.</p><br><p>His eyes sparkled as his left hand flashed with golden flame - not hot at all, for its source was not fire but the light that was Oskar's main power.</p><br><p>Then, Oskar put his left hand to his sword, making it burst with golden light and making the blade much larger.</p><br><p>"Not bad, but are you going to throw your sword straight into a volcano? I'm afraid even a Nexus that big won't be able to withstand the damage if it finds itself in the midst of powerful attacks." Katrin smirked, looking at Oskar's sword.</p><br><p>Oskar shook his head.</p><br><p>"That won't be necessary. Moreover, I'm going to make not just one attack, but several. Fortunately, Lero's magic circle allows me to amplify six attacks. There are only three of us, so... I'll make four attacks." Oskar said confidently.</p><br><p>Katrin tilted her head in confusion.</p><br><p>She didn't understand how Oskar was going to do this, because even if he had enough time to do it, he simply didn't have the strength.</p><br><p>No K1-Phantom was capable of using its Second Order four times in a row, and after the second time could be fatally exhausted.</p><br><p>Sure, the Phantoms had various limits, but the difference in stamina couldn't be that great. Even the Phantom's body had a limit, because as their bodies grew stronger, so did the power of their abilities, and thus the pressure coming from the abilities on their bodies.</p><br><p>It was like the caliber of a gun. The larger the caliber, the stronger the weapon needed to be, and the greater the recoil.</p><br><p>Oskar smirked, feeling Katrin's puzzled look on his face. Then, powerful currents of wind appeared around his left arm where there recently was a golden flame.</p><br><p>Quite quickly, the wind turned into a massive gauntlet covering Oskar's entire arm. The gauntlet had five long claws like a beast and three long sharp blades on the outer part.</p><br><p>"Oh... An artifact with a powerful ability, isn't it?" Katrin asked with mild interest.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah, something like that."</p><br><p>Then, he turned to Erla.</p><br><p>"Are you alright, ready?" Oskar asked, concern evident in his gaze. He worried that the recent conflict with Adam might have affected Erla more than they thought.</p><br><p>In response, Erla only nodded and gave a thumbs-up. Sure, Adam's words were like a dagger thrust into her mind, but she had already recovered from the incident.</p><br><p>She had an important task in front of her now and she was going to do her best.</p><br><br><p>Erla pointed her massive sniper rifle at the volcano, as her eyes shone brightly. The sniper rifle began to shake violently as if it was going to explode, but soon the trembling stopped.</p><br><p>Then, a light began to gather in the muzzle of the weapon that grew more powerful with each passing second.</p><br><p>"I'll be ready in ten seconds." Erla said confidently, keeping her finger on the trigger.</p><br><p>"Alright, then attack right after me." Oskar said standing on the edge of the volcano, "I don't know how deep Thunder Demon has gone, but when we destroy this volcano, there will be nothing left of it!"</p><br><p>Adam glanced at Oskar, then he looked down and closed his eyes.</p><br><p>He couldn't see through the layer of lava what Thunder Demon was doing, but he could try to hear something other than the bubbling lava.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, after a few seconds, Adam managed to do so. He heard the sound of claws digging into the larva's flesh as Thunder Demon's jaw ripped the larva king apart and actively devoured it.</p><br><p>Well, this was good news for them.</p><br><p>'I see... Thunder Demon is smart and cunning, so he decided to dive as deep as possible to defend against our attacks.</p><br><p>Hmm, that's not a bad plan, but we've prepared too well. When an entire squad of Phantoms are working together and gearing up to launch a powerful attack, it can bring about some really gruesome destruction.' Adam pondered for a moment before stepping forward.</p><br><br><br><p>At the same moment, Oskar swung his sword, releasing a golden beam of energy through the tip. Then, swung his left arm three times, releasing forward wind blades, each was fast and sharp, capable of cutting through even the strongest armor.</p><br><p>Erla took a deep breath and pulled the trigger, firing a powerful shot with a heavy, slow but devastating projectile.</p><br><p>The specialty of this projectile was that when it collided with its target it exploded, tearing the enemy apart. This ability had many flaws, but if the projectile hit its target, Erla could be sure that her opponent was finished.</p><br><p>Adam nodded approvingly before swinging his arms, throwing out his sphere of hundreds of silver threads.</p><br><p>Soon, all of their attacks passed through Lero's magic circle and were covered in a scarlet veil, becoming much more powerful and deadly.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the sphere, golden beam, wind blades, and massive projectile reached the lava plunging inward and approaching the Thunder Demon, who was sure to be hidden from interference.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide as he abruptly bounced back. Instinctively, he lifted Katrin into his arms and ran away as fast as he could.</p><br><p>The first shiver as the harbinger of a devastating explosion was more than enough for him to realize what was about to happen. One way or another, he had to save Katrin, for she was his teammate.</p><br><p>Normally, Katrin would have become indignant, but now she kept quiet and hoped Adam would run as fast as possible.</p><br><p>What about the others?</p><br><p>Well, it was time for Osana to act.</p><br><p>"Let's run guys!" Osana exclaimed summoning with her staff the wind currents that created wings on their feet. They weren't as big and powerful as Adam's, but they still made them much faster.</p><br><p>"Damn! This is going to be dangerous!" Oskar exclaimed before leaping forward.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same moment, the volcano exploded, raising a wave of lava that was more like a tsunami several dozen meters high.</p>
