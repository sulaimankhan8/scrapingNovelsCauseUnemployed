            <h4>Chapter 1417: Black Threads</h4><br><p>Twitch. Twitch. Twitch.
</p><br><p>Anelez tried to get up from the ground, but she was too weak to resist Erada, who was in her peak form.
</p><br><p>Moreover, Erada didn’t even pay her any attention. Like Anelez, after she used the Solar Form, her focus was only on Adam. Nothing else on this battlefield interested her except Adam.
</p><br><p>"You didn’t want to fight me," she said confidently. "It seems you’ve changed your mind now after this failure..." Erada glanced at Anelez. "She couldn’t do anything against you, could she?"
</p><br><p>"This..." Adam faltered. "Now I feel it."
</p><br><p>That wasn’t an answer to Erada’s question as she frowned.
</p><br><p>"What does that mean? What exactly do you feel? What are you talking about?"
</p><br><p>However, Adam didn’t answer that question either. His gaze showed that at that moment, he was thinking only about one thing—how to continue the fight.
</p><br><br><p>He vanished, and in the next moment, he appeared before Erada. Her eyes widened; she hadn’t expected him to lunge at her so suddenly.
</p><br><br><p>Blood spurted in front of her, but it wasn’t a serious wound. Her eyes looked down to see the cut on her palm and how Adam had grabbed her wrist tightly.
</p><br><p>"Come on, if we don’t use the Rule of Blood, we won’t be able to achieve the goals of this battle, right?" Adam squeezed her wrist tighter as their blood mixed.
</p><br><p>Confused, Erada froze for a moment. When she was preparing her plan to intervene in his and Anelez’s fight, she had imagined it differently.
</p><br><br><p>’This is even better!’ Erada exclaimed inwardly as her serious expression disappeared, replaced by a wide, almost maniacal grin.
</p><br><p>"Alright! The Rule of Blood, I agree!"
</p><br><p>She responded to his handshake as their auras collided with each other.
</p><br><p>[The Rule of Blood was concluded...]
</p><br><p>For a moment, an ancient voice rang out in their heads, but they paid no attention to it. All they needed was the tremor in their energy to understand that now they could no longer hold back.
</p><br><br><p>Without hesitation, Erada’s fist plunged deep into Adam’s stomach. Blood spurted from his mouth right onto her chest, but they both responded with only broad grins.
</p><br><p>"Looks like you have lightning abilities, right?" Erada raised her head arrogantly. "In that case, I have to show you that it’s useless against me!"
</p><br><br><p>She jumped high into the air, cutting through the wind currents. In a few moments, she and Adam were level with the gray clouds.
</p><br><p>"Get out of here!" Erada threw Adam aside as they both hovered in the air.
</p><br><p>They didn’t need a command or words to understand what was about to happen. They could see it in their opponent’s eyes.
</p><br><p>At the same time, Erada drew her hand back as the lightning bolts turned into a massive spear that could easily surpass Adam’s white spear in both size and destructive power.
</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam summoned the Dual Demon Sword, and they both attacked.
</p><br><p>The black lightning strike collided with the blue spear as a bright flash covered the silent expanse.
</p><br><p>Several spectators, both at the edge of the territory and in the arenas, grinned and nodded with satisfaction. This was the spectacle they had come here for. This was what they had expected from this battle in the first place.
</p><br><br><p>A gust of wind blew the black and blue cloud aside, revealing Adam and Erada, who were standing in the air with the help of energy. They slowly fell, but for their level, it was a respectable result.
</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh..." Adam was breathing heavily. He had already used many abilities and was wounded, the fifth ring being particularly difficult for his endurance.
</p><br><p>At the same time, Erada just stretched her neck.
</p><br><p>"What? Is that all you’ve got?" Erada cracked her knuckles with a broad grin.
</p><br><p>In an instant, she noticed Adam’s bloodied left shoulder as her gaze changed dramatically.
</p><br><p>"Hah, you know, you’re the second Hybrid I’ll have to defeat today." Adam smiled bitterly.
</p><br><p>Suddenly, his eyes widened when Erada’s hand came into motion.
</p><br><br><p>Her long claws dug into his left shoulder. Her face didn’t even flinch, and her eyes were full of determination.
</p><br><p>Adam was baffled, but soon he understood what had happened.
</p><br><p>"Oh, how nice of you."
</p><br><p>Erada waved her hand, and an arc of blood streaked across the sky.
</p><br><p>"It’ll be fairer this way. I knew Anelez couldn’t defeat you. However, she did inflict several wounds on you. After all, she’s not weak."
</p><br><p>"Yeah, she’s definitely not weak." Adam looked up at the white moon. "Hah, if you had shown this side of yourself from the beginning, maybe we would have fought at the Red Eye Arena."
</p><br><p>"This..." Erada faltered. "It’s not as simple as you think."
</p><br><p>"I see." Adam’s lips curved upward. "It’s all about the Solar Form, right?"
</p><br><p>She didn’t answer, but he understood everything from her dark glare.
</p><br><p>"Well, you just need to—!"
</p><br><br><p>Erada grabbed him by the neck, her claws piercing his skin, causing bloody trickles.
</p><br><p>"Shut up. I didn’t come here to talk. When I found out you had arrived at Izardo, I immediately wanted to fight you. Rest assured, unlike Anelez, who is unable to abandon his strategy, I am willing to do anything to defeat you."
</p><br><p>She leaned in as their foreheads touched.
</p><br><p>"You will lose, Adam Vinter!"
</p><br><p>With all her strength, Erada threw Adam down.
</p><br><p>His coat fluttered in the wind as he broke through the layer of gray clouds and crashed into the ground. His energy control couldn’t help him stop as Erada’s throw was too strong.
</p><br><p>By the time Adam got up from the ground and the cloud of dust cleared, Erada was already standing in front of him, steady and confident. In the end, Adam couldn’t inflict another wound on her.
</p><br><p>Crack. Crack. Crack.
</p><br><p>Adam’s Nexus shattered into pieces as he ran his bloodied hands through his hair.
</p><br><p>"Alright... I want to win too. So, I hope you’re ready!"
</p><br><p>Erada narrowed her eyes as a multitude of white threads appeared around Adam, but among them were now several black ones. The aura emanating from the tiny threads sent a chill down her spine, causing her to be on guard for the first time in their fight.</p>
