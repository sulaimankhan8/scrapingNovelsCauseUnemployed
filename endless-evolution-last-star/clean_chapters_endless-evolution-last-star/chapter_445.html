            <br><br><p>In the battle against the Plague Reaper, Osana saved Adam by using her unusual ability.</p><br><p>This was risky because even though she knew she could survive with her artifact, it was only an option if Adam and Katrin defeated the Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>Well, Osana turned out to be right and they all survived, including her.</p><br><p>A few weeks had passed since then, everyone was back to normal and going about their business.</p><br><p>Osana didn't immediately ask Adam to fulfill her three wishes, but that moment had come.</p><br><p>"She wants to meet this evening? Agh...I guess I just don't have any other choice, right?" Adam scratched the back of his head before replying to Osana's message.</p><br><p>Less than a minute later, he got the address and time. Osana seemed to be waiting for him to reply.</p><br><p>"Damn, I don't know why, but I have a feeling this isn't going to be easy at all. Though... She's already spent one wish of her own in her own words, right?"</p><br><p>For the next few hours, into the evening, Adam just walked here and there, he had no time or desire to do anything, he just wanted to wait until it was late evening and they would meet.</p><br><p>Osana was a cunning and calculating person, it alarmed Adam, but he felt a slight curiosity.</p><br><p>A lot had happened since they returned to the Citadel, so he completely forgot that he was supposed to fulfill Osana's three wishes.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam could refuse and do nothing, he could call it just bullshit and ignore her. But... Adam couldn't help but recognize the fact that Osana indeed saved his life.</p><br><p>'If she hadn't appeared in front of me then...' Adam internally muttered remembering the Plague Reaper's attack, 'Then he definitely would have killed me. His fist would have blown me up like a piece of meat.'</p><br><p>A slight shiver ran through Adam's body. Then, death was closer to him than ever.</p><br><p>Time passed and it wasn't long before, Adam was standing on an ordinary street next to a high lamp illuminating his tall silhouette.</p><br><p>It wasn't some restaurant or popular meeting point, just a random street where people rarely passed by at this late hour.</p><br><p>Adam arrived a few minutes early, so he didn't complain that Osana hadn't shown up yet. He didn't know why she chose this place, but he was just honoring her wishes.</p><br><p>At exactly the appointed time, a black car appeared from around the corner. It was different from those used by the military or government employees, as it was an expensive sports car, looking as exquisite as it was expensive.</p><br><p>The window rolled down as a hand and long pink hair came out.</p><br><p>"Hey handsome, who are you waiting for?"</p><br><p>Osana smirked, glancing at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"If you're in a car, why must I come to this deserted place? Couldn't you have just picked me up?"</p><br><p>Adam looked slightly indignant before walking over and opening the door, sitting on the front seat next to Osana.</p><br><p>"So... Did I just fulfill your first wish?" Adam asked, unsure.</p><br><p>Osana nodded with a kind smile on her face.</p><br><p>"Yes, now I only have two wishes left. Don't worry, I won't ask you for something strange, impossible, or immoral."</p><br><p>Adam cast a quick glance at her. He didn't know Osana very well, since the same person in the Dead Lands and in the Citadel could behave very differently. But, something still confused him, though he couldn't quite figure out what it was.</p><br><p>"In that case, what's your second wish?" Adam asked as he shook his hand.</p><br><p>Osana shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"You'll find out soon enough. I'm sure you'll love it. For now, just enjoy the ride since I'm going to speed up!"</p><br><p>Osana uttered before pushing down on the pedal with force, causing the car to rapidly accelerate several times.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment as he was sharply pressed into the seat, he never was in such fast cars but it only took him a few seconds to come to his senses.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, they were headed for the First Ring, so it took them quite a while to get there.</p><br><p>However, even once in the First Ring, Osana did not go to the center or to areas where there were restaurants, nightclubs, and other entertainment places.</p><br><p>Instead, they went to the far side of the First Ring, one of the few places where it was quiet now, and there were many abandoned and unfinished buildings that for various reasons hadn't yet been torn down or renovated.</p><br><p>The lights were working properly, but were sparse and dim, as people rarely came here. This neighborhood was like where poor people were supposed to live, but no one lived there since there weren't such poor people in the First Ring.</p><br><p>So... why did Osana need to come here with a car worth several hundred thousand credits?</p><br><br><p>Osana opened the door and before Adam could do anything she was at his door, opening a passage for him.</p><br><p>"Let's go, I think it should be ready by now."</p><br><p>Adam nodded. He felt a little strange as Osana treated him as if he was an important guest or she was his escort.</p><br><p>Following Osana, they turned into an alley, completely dark and uninviting, then, they descended an old staircase finding themselves in front of a heavy iron door.</p><br><p>Unlike everything else, the door looked new and clean. The stairs were stone, covered in a thick layer of dust and cracks, as was the brick paving around it, but time seemed to have spared this door.</p><br><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p><br><p>Osana knocked three times, but there was no response from the other side. Then, she did it a few more tries, varying the time between knocks and the number of knocks as if it were a secret code.</p><br><br><p>The door finally opened, revealing a medium-sized room like some old-fashioned but luxurious restaurant. There were no screens, no robots, no metal or other details that modern restaurants used in their design and for comfort.</p><br><p>Just a large round wooden table, chandeliers with soft lighting, oak cabinets with showcases behind which were hidden sets and expensive bottles of wine.</p><br><p>On the table was a large candle, slowly burning among two trays covered with a lid. Forks and knives were already in place.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, there was no one in the room. There was another door at the far end, where one could get out before Osana and Adam went in.</p><br><br><p>With a confident gait, Osana moved forward, pushing one chair back, but did not sit down. Instead, she waved her hand indicating the empty seat.</p><br><p>"Go ahead and take a seat." Osana said with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>Adam nodded slowly as the door closed behind him, despite its size it happened quietly and almost unnoticed.</p><br><p>He didn't know why Osana was acting this way, but he didn't resist. It was her wish after all.</p><br><p>When Adam sat down, Osana smiled and took the second seat across from him.</p><br><p>"Now it's time to tell you about my second wish." Osana uttered as a sly smile appeared on her face.</p><br><p>Adam listened to her intently.</p><br><p>"I want you to share this dinner with me. I'm sure you'll love it." Osana smirked before lifting the lid revealing the dish.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>It was half a heart, which was quite a lot like a human heart.</p><br><p>And... for some reason, that heart seemed familiar to him.
