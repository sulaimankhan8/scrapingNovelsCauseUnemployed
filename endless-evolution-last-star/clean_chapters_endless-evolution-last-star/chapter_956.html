            <br><p>Baffled, but the Inferno Serpent was going to listen to Adam. Somehow, his original goal was to find a Phantom strong enough to fix his dire situation.</p><br><p>With a shiver running through the lava lake, the Inferno Serpent slowly turned around, moving towards the river in the distance - the only way forward and out of the lake.</p><br><br><p>Risha's shout reached their ears, yet the Inferno Serpent did not stop, only Adam turned around.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Go back to Orel. I'm sure your big brother is worried about you. We're all like that..." his gaze deepened. "I realize you don't want to come with me, so I won't force you. You'd better leave now before the monsters come back. Many ran away from our battle, I'm sure of it."</p><br><p>There was no reply. Risha gritted her teeth clenching her fists tightly.</p><br><p>She realized that Adam was right. The best thing for her to do was to go back and think about her next steps.</p><br><br><p>Risha didn't know the ins and outs of the Upper Ring, but she knew that the Phantoms at the Lower Ring progressed much faster. However, her speed and Adam's was no comparison.</p><br><br><p>Pushing all thoughts away, Risha leapt forward bouncing away from the only island.</p><br><p>"Fuck! I said wait!" Risha shouted, struggling to grab onto the Inferno Serpent's tail.</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent glanced over, a smirk showing on his face, insidious and kind at the same time.</p><br><p>"Hah... girl, looks like you're not as cowardly as I thought. But are you sure about your decision? It's not too late to go back."</p><br><p>Risha didn't say anything, she just looked down at the broken scales of the serpent.</p><br><br><p>The Inferno Serpent stopped abruptly at the slope, and Risha fell over in shock.</p><br><p>"I'm serious," the serpent wheezed. "It's all clear with that young man. He chose one path to power - through battles against stronger opponents. That's what almost all monsters and many Phantoms do. However, it is not a path for everyone, dangerous and bloody.</p><br><p>"You are no match for me. Against an S5 monster, you don't stand a chance much less. If you want to go to the castle to achieve your goals, fine. But, if it's just your stupid whim then you better go back or you'll only face a nameless and meaningless death."</p><br><br><br><p>"Stop being so dramatic. You're even worse than my brother! I'm not going to fight against your master, I'll leave that task to that psycho," she nodded her head in Adam's direction. "I just don't see the point of going home."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"Agh..." Risha sighed heavily. "Look, I went here to show you the Cave Grid, and what did I end up accomplishing? I shamefully lost to some S3 monster and with my mouth open, shivering with fear watched you fight against an S4 monster."</p><br><p>With a brief pause, she leaned forward, caressing the Inferno Serpent on his scales.</p><br><p>"You grew stronger before my eyes - I remained just as weak. If I return home I will not become stronger, I am not satisfied as a resident of the Lower Ring and the Red Bears member."</p><br><p>Adam and the Inferno Serpent exchanged a glance. At that moment, they looked like two old friends, if only for a second.</p><br><p>"Hah, that's your business," Adam waved his hand, patting the spot next to him. "Have a seat. We have a long road ahead of us and hopefully a very interesting story."</p><br><p>The Inferno Serpent was partially submerged in the lava, only the top of his head poking out.</p><br><p>"You won't be disappointed... Adam Vinter... You guessed a lot of things though. Not only do I have to serve a stronger monster, but my folk..."</p><br><p>A wave of shock passed over Adam and Risha's faces, and a surge of lava rushed over the edge as their descent down the river began.</p><br><p>The Fallen Ring Castle was farther away than they could have imagined. If they were at the Dead Lands, they would have to travel to the far side of the Wild Lands, more than an hour's flight in the fastest fighter.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, another cookie broke in Orel's hand.</p><br><p>Hygon grinned widely. "Hahaha! Orel, did you see that? Lorana, you owe me now! I told you they would both agree to his offer!"</p><br><p>Lorana rolled her eyes and touched Hygon's NEP. The screens flashed as a hundred thousand came into Hygon's account.</p><br><p>"You'd think something would change in your life from that money."</p><br><p>"Hah, of course not!" Hygon slapped the table. "The money is just a nice bonus! The most important thing was to be right!"</p><br><p>Watching Adam and Risha, Orel nodded slightly. "Well, I have to admit that I was wrong too. I thought only Adam would agree. I didn't expect that from my sister. It was a reckless decision and rather stupid."</p><br><p>"Hehehe..." Hygon leaned forward, a dangerous gleam running across his eyes. "Isn't that our slogan? I'd do the exact same thing if I were them. No! I wouldn't even hesitate and go straight to punching that S5 monster's face!"</p><br><p>"Oh, god..." Lorana shook her head disapprovingly. "Do you even hear what you? How are you even still alive?"</p><br><p>Not about to stop, Hygon turned to her, but Orel beat him to it.</p><br><p>'Hygon..." he muttered. "Can you do me a favor?"</p><br><p>Suddenly, Hygon became serious. He changed completely in the blink of an eye.</p><br><p>"You want me to keep an eye on them?"</p><br><p>Orel leaned on his arm. "Something like that. Only for my sister. Adam Vinter's fate is in his hands."</p><br><p>Lorana frowned. "I thought you trusted your sister. Do you think they can't handle it? I'm sure at the right moment Risha will open the third lesser gates."</p><br><p>"That's not the point... We've all heard that serpent, and I don't know what S5 monster we're talking about. The Fallen Ring Castle... Aren't the serpent folk ruling there? I don't like it... I don't like it when I don't know something."</p><br><p>"I wouldn't want to be your sister. Too much control," Lorana lit a cigarette.</p><br><p>"Shut up. I just love her. I'm her brother after all."</p>
