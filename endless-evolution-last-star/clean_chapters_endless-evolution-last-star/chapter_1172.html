            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1172: To be alive or not? (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>Once again, Adam’s companion left before him, leaving him alone with a half-empty bottle of wine and half-melted ice cream.</p><br><p>Adam had neither thirst nor appetite. Mariam had made him think about many things, although he wasn’t sure that was what he wanted.</p><br><p>‘Shit, even if it’s Silvana. Am I ready for a family? Maybe I’m thinking about this too soon, the World Wipe is still seven years away. Then again, maybe Mariam is right, and I won’t even notice the years passing?</p><br><p>A few moments later, Adam shook his head and quickly finished his ice cream before it melted completely.</p><br><p>He didn’t know the bill, and he didn’t really care. What was the point of money if it no longer had any value to him?</p><br><br><p>The massive wooden doors opened as Adam stepped outside.</p><br><p>The cold night wind greeted him, rushing through the narrow streets of the densely populated First Ring.</p><br><p>He was about to return home when something caught his eye.</p><br><p>Not far from the entrance, a tall girl stood against the wall. She wore a simple jacket and black pants, and her gaze was fixed on Adam.</p><br><p>Her black hair fluttered in the wind, and her green eyes were as deep as ancient emeralds.</p><br><p>“S-Silvana…?” Adam stammered, shocked.</p><br><p>After he returned to the Citadel, and up until that moment, they had not been in contact. They could use shared voice or shared sight at any time, but that didn’t mean they had to watch each other’s every move.</p><br><p>She nodded slightly and moved away from the wall, keeping her hands in her pockets.</p><br><p>“How did your conversation go?” Silvana asked calmly. It was impossible to tell from her expression what emotions she was feeling at that moment.</p><br><p>Adam didn’t know what to say. He didn’t understand how Silvana had ended up here, or more precisely, why she had waited for him for so long when she could have gone inside much earlier.</p><br><p>“How do you know that? I mean… I didn’t sense you here.”</p><br><br><p>“Sure, because before she went to get you, Mariam had a long talk with me.”</p><br><p>“So…” Adam stammered.</p><br><p>“Yeah. I know what you talked about. I found out before you did. Mariam… I wasn’t expecting to see her, but she made me think about a lot of things.”</p><br><br><p>Silvana moved closer to Adam until their foreheads were almost touching.</p><br><p>“I had some time to think about what she said. I decided not to rush into anything and give you a chance to do the same. That’s why I waited for you here, at the entrance to the restaurant…”</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly as his eyes trembled a little.</p><br><p>“So… What do you think about it?”</p><br><p>“What?” Adam asked quickly, the words flying out of his mouth.</p><br><p>“About the children. Because… It’s not just your family that will disappear in seven years, but mine too. It will just be you and me, and maybe our children.”</p><br><p>A multitude of emotions flashed across Adam’s face. He had thought about how he would have this conversation with Silvana, but he had expected it to happen in a few months or even years!</p><br><p>But not only did it happen much faster, Silvana had initiated the conversation and seemed to know even more than he did.</p><br><p>“Silvana, do you want us to have a family?” Adam asked firmly.</p><br><p>Despite Silvana’s cold stare, her cheeks grew redder and redder.</p><br><p>“Yes… Maybe the World Wipe will be a big blow for both of us, but we can’t let it break us. We have to remember our families and take care of what we create.</p><br><p>“Sure, it’s too early to talk about it, but it’s Mariam’s fault. Seven years is nothing to her, but for us it’s a huge amount of time. However, given the situation, there’s nothing wrong with thinking about it now. Sooner or later, that day will come.”</p><br><p>Adam didn’t say anything for a while. Deep down, he felt relieved that Silvana didn’t mind.</p><br><p>“Hah, you’re right. Mariam set us up. She doesn’t even realize that we haven’t come to terms with the fact that the World Wipe will destroy everything.”</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip.</p><br><p>“What about you, Adam? Would you like to start a family with me?”</p><br><p>Adam smiled faintly.</p><br><p>“There can be no doubt about that. All these events have happened too quickly for me to make any promises about timing, but if I were to start a family, it would only be with you.”</p><br><p>Silvana didn’t answer. She had expected that response, although her chest still felt warmer and her heart was beating faster.</p><br><p>“But… Silvana, you know what Mariam was talking to me about, right? She didn’t just mention starting a family, she offered herself as a candidate and…”</p><br><p>Silvana interrupted him. “And other female Hybrids from the Crimson Path. Yes, I know that too.”</p><br><p>“And? Don’t you have anything to say about that?”</p><br><p>“Well…” Silvana glanced away. “I won’t hide that I want you to belong only to me, that you, your heart, and your genes are only mine. But… If you do this with them without love, just so that they too can have hope for a family, then…”</p><br><p>Before Silvana could finish, Adam grabbed her wrist and spun her around to face the wall.</p><br><p>Silvana gasped when Adam kissed her powerfully and aggressively.</p><br><p>“Come on. You can be more open about your desires. I wouldn’t want anyone else to get a treasure like you. We share the desire to possess each other.”</p><br><p>Silvana didn’t say a word, only breathing heavily and intermittently.</p><br><p>“Let’s go home. Right now…”</p><br><br><p>“You’re not going to take Mariam’s advice right now, are you?”</p><br><p>“No, in seven years, then we’ll start a new life… Everything from scratch, and we won’t let our children go through what we did.”</p><br><p>Adam had nothing more to say. He lifted her into his arms as his frame trembled, disappearing into the shadows.</p><br><p>Perhaps for someone else like Mariam, children were just a way to avoid being alone for the next 250 years, but Adam and Silvana couldn’t be that heartless.</p><br><p>Still, while Silvana’s eyes sparkled, a deep darkness lurked within Adam. His desire to have everything, both his family and his future family with Silvana, grew stronger with every passing moment.</p>
