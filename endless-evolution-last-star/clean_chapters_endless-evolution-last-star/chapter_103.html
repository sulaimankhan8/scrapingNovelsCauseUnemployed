            <br><p>The terrifying roar was heard by everyone. Not only the Phantoms and Military but the residents of Bastion as well.</p><br><p>Sure, ordinary people had nothing to worry about, or rather... nothing depended on them. They could only hope that the Phantoms would fulfill their task, as always.</p><br><p>Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.</p><br><p>After just a few minutes, hundreds of shadows appeared in the distance, moving straight at them with tremendous speed.</p><br><p>There were many monsters, but their auras were stable and moderately strong. Enough to be a threat to K1-Squad, but for the sake of victory, they would have to try hard.</p><br><p>The monsters targeted opponents with the right level of strength. Roughly speaking, the Left North Squad won't face a monster whose threat level is higher than the purple one. However, it was unlikely they would encounter green ones, and they definitely wouldn't face white threat-level monsters.</p><br><p>"Who's that?" Adam asked, staring intently at the running monsters. The light had already gotten on them, thus Adam could get a closer look at them.</p><br><p>'It's Snow Imots, Blue Threat Level, White Book.' Silvana replied calmly.</p><br><p>Snow Imots had a muscular build with broad chests and chunky paws. They moved like gorillas, using their powerful hind paws and shaking the ground with their front ones.</p><br><p>They were protected from the cold by a thick hide, not every blade could cut through it, but only a particularly sharp one. An additional defense was the dense white fur.</p><br><p>Snow Imots didn't have claws, but they had something better - powerful jaws with two long fangs extending beyond their maws.</p><br><p>Adam stepped forward, intending to be one of the first to face the Snow Imots. He didn't run from challenges and was ready to fight the monsters for as long as it took.</p><br><br><p>However, Silvana's voice stopped him.</p><br><p>'Don't be in a hurry. The eclipse will last for quite a while, until sunrise, meaning you should save your energy for the whole night. There's no point in wasting energy, much less abilities, on such weak monsters. If one of them comes up, kill it, but with simple attacks.' Silvana said confidently.</p><br><p>She knew what Adam was capable of as well as Snow Imots, and it was obvious to her that Snow Imots were too weak.</p><br><p>After all, although everyone in the Left North Squad was K1-Phantoms, they were not equal. Some had just revealed their Lock, while others were at the peak of their strength and would soon be ready to create a First Key.</p><br><p>Adam cast a glance at Alexia. Unlike the other Phantoms, she was in no hurry to join the fight. She nodded from time to time as she listened to her Operator.</p><br><p>"Come on! What are you waiting for? The monsters are right in front of us!" A man with a long spear exclaimed, rushing into battle like a mad warrior.</p><br><p>"ROOOAAAAARR!!!" Snow Imot roared furiously, lunging at the man, extending his powerful paws, heavy as hammers, towards him.</p><br><p>The man smirked, took a step forward, and swung his spear, ending up behind Snow Imot and leaving a long cut on the monster's chest.</p><br><p>Then, the man continued to attack until Snow Imot helplessly fell to the ground.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, that was easy!" The man laughed confidently.</p><br><br><p>A massive paw threw the man aside, causing his eyes to go wide with bright pain. The man rolled over the snow, unable to stop, while Snow Imot stepped forward, but... that one was a little different.</p><br><p>Instead of two long fangs, it had four, and the blue runes on its powerful paws shone brightly. It was Fury Snow Imot - Blue Threat Level, Red Book.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Fury Imot did not attack the man further, instead, the monster headed towards a stronger opponent - Alexia.</p><br><p>However, Alexia wasn't paying attention to Fury Imot at all, she just looked away with a thoughtful gaze. It seemed that Fury Imot was not worthy of her concern.</p><br><br><p>The monster sensed this, going into a rage at such neglect towards itself. Fury Imot ran at Alexia, shaking the ground beneath it.</p><br><p>"Look out!" Someone shouted, but... Alexia didn't react in any way.</p><br><br><p>The monster's fist came down on her face, plunging her into the ground, into the depths of the high snow. Blood spurted from her nose, and her gaze finally stopped being hazy.</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" Alexia raised an eyebrow in confusion, "You decided to fight me? Are you serious? Damn, I can't believe it. Have your instincts snapped?"</p><br><p>It seemed that not only Phantoms but also Fury Imot was puzzled, for Alexia was looking at him like a harmless animal. Even if she was stronger, the reactions were too careless.</p><br><p>"Alright, you decided to do it yourself." Alexia shrugged before stepping forward.</p><br><br><p>In a dash, whizzing across the snow and slippery ice, Alexia found herself right in front of Fury Imot. She jumped slightly, just enough to bring her fist down on Fury Imot's head, from top to bottom, diagonally.</p><br><p>Vibrations went through the monster's thick hide, like ground from an earthquake, then the impact, nailed Fury Imot's to the earth, and the momentum from the impact exploded the monster's head.</p><br><br><p>Alexia yawned, stretching, it seemed as easy for her as killing a mosquito.</p><br><p>The phantoms looked at her in surprise for a while, then they smiled and went back to fighting. It was important for them to see what their leader was capable of. It greatly increased their fighting spirit!</p><br><p>'Oh, that was strong...' Adam pondered while being impressed.</p><br><p>He looked at his fist with a deep gaze.</p><br><p>'Hmm... I might be able to kill that monster with one punch, but would I be able to blow its head off? Well, I'll find out soon. I haven't tested my new powers in battle yet!'</p><br><p>Soon, the Snow Imots became much less, it seemed that the Left North Squad had dealt with the first wave of monsters.</p><br><p>However, someone special soon appeared in the distance. It was a single Snow Imot, with others following behind, and gradually, more and more of them appeared.</p><br><p>This Snow Imot did not have extra fangs or protective plates on its body, nor was it a Crown or Essence Type.</p><br><p>But, there was one detail that distinguished this Snow Imot from all the others - a visible blue aura around it, an icy crown on its head, and cross-shaped pupils as if signaling an unshakable order.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Snow Imot opened its maw wide, letting out a roar that spread for hundreds of meters around.</p><br><p>However, there was no rage or malice in its roar - only the majesty and warlike spirit of a military chief of a formidable army.</p><br><p>As the roar passed, the bodies of the other Snow Imots were covered in the same layer of blue energy, and their pupils turned golden.</p><br><p>With the arrival of this unusual Snow Imot, and especially after its roar, all the Phantoms became wary. No one was smiling anymore, only serious faces and the mood for a bloody battle.</p><br><p>It was easy to understand their reactions because the monster in front of them was one of the Conqueror Type!</p>
