            <br><p>In most cases, weddings were crowded and large-scale events where dozens or even hundreds of people of different statuses and power gathered.</p><br><p>However, although a wedding, especially a noble one, would often have very rich and powerful people in attendance, none of them were the main center of attention.</p><br><p>Everyone knew what weddings were for, and the culmination of each wedding was the engagement of the bride and groom so that they could become husband and wife.</p><br><p>So, although the bride and groom had not yet appeared, everyone realized that the actual wedding had not yet begun.</p><br><p>And... there was not much time left to wait as the sun was heading towards the horizon, it was already evening time, but in summer, darkness came much later than usual.</p><br><br><p>There were light, quiet footsteps radiating anticipation before the end of the day.</p><br><p>It seemed to be one more guest among many others, but as soon as people saw the figure entering the banquet hall, they abruptly fell silent.</p><br><p>"Oh, there he is..." Mariel gasped, her eyes sparkling.</p><br><p>Looking around with a joyful smile on his face, greeting the guests with a wave of his hand, a tall young man with a lean build walked forward. He was wearing a tight, black groom's suit as he was Nirosh Marzo. Your journey continues on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Hey. I'm glad to see all of you here! Thank you for coming!" Nirosh said with a glowing look of joy.</p><br><p>Nirosh had thick, curly brown hair just like his father and sister, hazel eyes, and a sharp chin.</p><br><p>Zarot smiled widely, clapping his hands together a few times.</p><br><p>"Good, it's about time. If the groom is already here, then the bride is coming soon!"</p><br><p>Reinal cast a glance at Nirosh, then looked at the rest of the guests.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Now I can't feel anything again. I don't see Nirosh being threatened by anyone or anything. In any case, I must remain vigilant. I don't believe Osana will just accept her fate, it's an unrealistic outcome.'</p><br><p>Nirosh was worthy of more than just Reinal's attention as his sister was also looking at him with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>'Just look at his satisfied expression.'</p><br><p>Istrid inwardly uttered, holding three fingers on her cheek with a thoughtful look.</p><br><p>'I understand him, though. He was able to win such a rare tribute as Osana De Rouzet. To subdue a rebellious girl, hah, it seems I've overreacted before. Seeing my brother so happy was worth coming here.'</p><br><p>Then, a sharp glint passed across her deep eyes.</p><br><p>'But... is all I have to do is watch them become husband and wife while eating appetizers? Well, that would be too boring anyway.'</p><br><br><p>Nirosh walked on before reaching Mariel and Zarot.</p><br><p>"So, are you ready?" Zarot smiled broadly, patting Nirosh on the shoulder, "Pretty soon you will no longer be a single man, and Osana De Rouzet will be your main wife!"</p><br><p>Nirosh nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Sure, I guess I should thank fate that our origins as Phantoms are different, otherwise I wouldn't be able to get consent from a lady like her."</p><br><p>Slowly, Nirosh looked at Mariel.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry to take your daughter away, but I just can't help myself."</p><br><p>Mariel blushed slightly and shook her head, showing that he shouldn't apologize for such a thing.</p><br><p>"I'm actually grateful to you. I don't know what would happen to my sweet little angel if she continued to be a rebel. But, with you, she'll be framed with love and care."</p><br><p>Istrid standing in the distance let out a heavy sigh, she nodded slightly.</p><br><p>'Yeah... Mariel is right, except that for Osana it will be a golden cage. People like her value freedom above all else, so I doubt she's as excited about this wedding as Nirosh is. Although, there's nothing she can do as Artificial Phantom.'</p><br><p>Nirosh, Mariel, and Zarot continued to chat.</p><br><p>The groom had already arrived, which meant that the bride would be coming soon, everyone understood that.</p><br><p>Silvana gulped as she glanced at her watch.</p><br><p>'Damn, even though everything is going strictly on schedule, I'm still nervous.'</p><br><p>Silvana glared at Gladius who was calm, occasionally stealing olives from the tables while no one saw.</p><br><p>Then, Silvana turned to Franz, Nelya, and Rosalind, about to ask them something.</p><br><p>But, before she could say anything, her eyes went wide for a moment.</p><br><p>'What? Where did Rosalind disappear to?' Silvana was baffled, looking at Franz and Nelya chatting, left without their faithful servant.</p><br><p>Silvana searched around but Rosalind was nowhere to be found, it was as if she disappeared from the banquet hall like a ghost, and her destination was unknown.</p><br><br><p>Under the amber rays of the sun going into the sunset, Rosalind slowly stepped forward.</p><br><p>Besides her, some of the guests also decided to leave the banquet hall for some fresh air, but unlike them, Rosalind did not go to the spacious garden in front of the massive gate where the guests could rest and quickly return to the banquet.</p><br><p>She headed for one of the side exits from the Rouzet Family Palace. There were guards at all exits and entrances, they were mere humans, but they had enough ways to report intruders to the powerful Phantoms among the Rouzet Family.</p><br><p>Rosalind saw the guards in the distance standing in front of the black iron gates with sharp pikes, two men in dark military-like uniforms, their hands folded behind their backs and their gazes sharp.</p><br><br><p>Rosalind glanced away and sat down on the nearest expensive redwood bench. She looked at the sun, then at her watch, and nodded deeply.</p><br><p>Since the sun was on the horizon line, every minute could significantly change the perception of the current day phase.</p><br><p>After only ten minutes it became considerably darker, and when another fifteen minutes passed and the sun was almost gone, Rosalind finally rose.</p><br><p>Then, in the distance beyond the black gate amidst the darkness of the approaching night, appeared a shadow, waiting for this moment for a long time, perhaps too long.</p>
