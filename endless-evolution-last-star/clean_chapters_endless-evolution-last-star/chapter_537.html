            <br><p>Zarot's gaze was directed at Nelya for a while, then he took a moment to Franz, who was walking behind her with a wide smile on his face before slowly turning around.</p><br><p>"Mariel... Did something happen that I don't know about? Why is Franz Balo here? Why is the Balo Family doing this? And... why did they bring Nelya Balo here?" Zarot narrowed his eyes, clenching his fists tighter.</p><br><br><p>Mariel, with trembling fingers, gnawed her nails with great grimace. There was no trace left of her easy smile and calm expression.</p><br><p>"No, no, no... I don't know what's going on here, but I don't like it. The wedding has to be perfect, everything has to go flawlessly!" Mariel didn't stop, as soon as she dealt with the first nail, the next one came in line.</p><br><p>Zarot nodded deeply, as he walked over to Mariel and grabbed her wrist, stopping her nail-biting.</p><br><p>"Calm down. We just need to keep an eye on us. Most of all, no one else from the Balo Family showed up, so... apparently, it was Franz's decision. There are too many powerful people here to let them interfere in any way."</p><br><p>Then, Zarot's eyes narrowed, stopping at Nelya.</p><br><p>"Though I must admit I don't see why she's here. They'll probably have some complaints about me, but that's fine, as long as it doesn't affect the wedding in any way."</p><br><p>Mariel gulped as she nodded deeply, calming down slightly.</p><br><p>Zarot waved his hand, heading off down the aisle.</p><br><p>"Istrid, come on, it's time to visit the banquet hall. I'm sure we'll find many interesting things waiting for us there."</p><br><p>With a look full of nonchalance, Istrid shrugged and followed her father.</p><br><br><p>Reinal walked slowly to the window, leaning with both hands on the ledge. His gaze wasn't looking anywhere in particular, since his mind was busy thinking.</p><br><p>'Hmm... Can Franz Balo, without the support of his family somehow prevent the wedding from happening? No, it's physically and technically impossible.'</p><br><p>Reinal scratched the back of his head before raising his gaze, looking at the spacious garden in the front yard of their palace, just outside the massive gate.</p><br><p>'Bur... Then why does this strange feeling never leave me? It's as if a real monster has crept in here, amongst the common people and nobles... This invisible tension is frightening...'</p><br><br><br><p>Flying under the bright light, a large seedless olive ended up in Gladius's mouth. Unlike the other waiters, he wasn't shy about sampling appetizers or alcohol, he did it as naturally as if he were the main guest.</p><br><p>"Damn it! What are you doing? You ate more olives than all the guests combined!" Silvana exclaimed irritably, holding the empty tray under her shoulder.</p><br><p>Gladius spread his hand apart with a confused face.</p><br><p>"What? It's not my fault no one eats them!"</p><br><p>Gladius uttered with a sincere expression before picking up another olive from the plate. He clasped it between his fingers, examining it intently.</p><br><p>"And why do so few people like olives? They're delicious, they're like sunflower seeds aren't they?" Gladius suggested as he swallowed the olive.</p><br><p>Silvana sighed heavily shaking her head.</p><br><p>'Fuck... What's wrong with him? How are we not in trouble yet due to his willful actions?'</p><br><p>While Silvana tried to calm herself down and deal with the situation, Gladius's eyes traveled all around the banquet hall.</p><br><p>'Almost all the guests are gathered by now, most of the seats are taken and the sun is moving towards the horizon, about to go into the sunset... It's about time. All the figures are in their seats except for the main two.'</p><br><p>At the same moment, one of the previously closed doors opened as Mariel, Reinal, Zarot, and Istrid entered the banquet hall.</p><br><p>All the guests immediately took notice of them and several waiters approached so that each of them could take a glass of wine.</p><br><p>However... before either of them could say anything, three more silhouettes came in through the main passage, taking some of the attention for themselves. Read exclusive content at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><br><p>Undeterred, Gladius grabbed Silvana's hand and headed forward. They were the first waiters that approached the three silhouettes.</p><br><p>"Welcome." Gladius said with a slight smile casting a quick glance at Franz and Rosalind before stopping at Nelya.</p><br><p>"Oh, I didn't expect to see someone so beautiful and lovely among the guests..."</p><br><p>Gladius muttered and waved his hand, stopping the tray in front of Nelya.</p><br><p>"Young lady, is there anything you would like? Alcohol, cheese, jerky, nuts, maybe... a few olives?"</p><br><p>At this time Silvana approached Rosalind and Franz, trying to look as natural as possible.</p><br><p>Nelya nodded slightly before taking a glass of champagne, slowly and carefully. She didn't know who Gladius was and wouldn't be able to recognize him through his disguise.</p><br><p>Franz and Rosalind glanced over, then they turned to Silvana and took a glass each from her tray.</p><br><p>Silence fell in the hall, no one said anything, and everyone just looked from one side to the other, not knowing how the members of the great families would behave.</p><br><br><p>Mariel walked forward, she was alone, the others remained in their places. After all, she was in charge here now. Mariel was not the head of the Rouzet family, but she had the highest status here.</p><br><p>She was the one who organized this wedding, sent out the invitations, and was actively involved in any other matters related to Osana and Nirosh.</p><br><p>"Franz Balo and Nelya Balo... I won't hide it, seeing you here is a surprise, a pleasant surprise." Mariel smiled forcefully, trying to appear sincere.</p><br><p>Well, Franz and Nelya were nobles for too long to pay attention to fake smiles and compliments. In the society of nobles, as well as politics, words or smiles could not be trusted. It was one of the first rules the nobles learned.</p><br><br><p>Franz raised his glass demonstratively.</p><br><p>"I'm glad we were well received, but where are the bride and groom? I'm sure everyone is here just to see these two become a happy family!"</p><br><p>Franz said with excitement, his voice gradually becoming quieter until a sly grin appeared on his face that he was unable to contain.</p><br><p>All the while, Reinal stared intently in their direction, trying to make sense of his feelings.</p>
