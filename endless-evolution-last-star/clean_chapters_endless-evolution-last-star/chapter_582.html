            <br><p>When Phantoms summoned their Spirits and released their auras, all eyes were on their embodiments.
</p><br><p>It was only natural, as the next stage of the battle depended on it.
</p><br><p>However... no one forbade a fighter from going straight to the next stage if they had the opportunity.
</p><br><p>Fromund decided to do just that.
</p><br><br><p>Adam gasped rolling over the dusty ground a few times before stopping. Instinctively, to avoid being in a vulnerable position, Adam got down on one knee, regaining his balance.
</p><br><p>He raised his arms ready to block Fromund’s next attack. He didn’t think Fromund was going to stop there.
</p><br><br><p>Streams of blood gushed from Fromund’s mouth as he hesitantly stepped back, seemingly ready to fall from the sharp pain, his legs trembling.
</p><br><p>Trying to realize what had happened, Adam looked up and his eyes went wide for a moment.
</p><br><p>The flame warrior was holding onto his left shoulder, blood running down his large hand. The Ghost Tailor stood not far away, his left palm covered in the warrior’s blood, crimson droplets running down the amber threads like dew along a spider’s web.
</p><br><p>In the wake of Adam’s Spirit, the flame warrior took damage, and for Fromund, that could only mean one thing: an internal wound.
</p><br><p>Well, he managed to take advantage of the moment when Adam was distracted and inflicted an equally significant wound on his opponent.
</p><br><p>"Damn, I thought my Spirit would just nail yours to the ground or explode on a direct hit, but... Its needle was stronger, and the threads I thought were defense were weapons... Not bad, not bad at all."
</p><br><p>Fromund sighed heavily, spitting out a clot of blood and stretching his shoulders. He was ready to continue, the flaming warrior hovering above him began to slowly dissipate. Only the metallic taste in his mouth reminded him of the wound he received.
</p><br><p>Adam frowned but took his time.
</p><br><p>Glancing at the ghostly tailor who soon disappeared, Adam wiped a trickle of blood from the corner of his mouth and slowly, rose holding a hand on his knee.
</p><br><p>"Your Nexus. Don’t you think it’s time to show it?"
</p><br><p>Adam said in a firm voice before extending his arm to the side.
</p><br><p>"Since I’m not going to wait any longer. We’ve been through the battle of our Spirits, and this is more than enough to warm us up..."
</p><br><p>A bright light filled Adam’s eyes, the energy traveled down his arm transforming into a long needle with two sharp blades and a recess in the middle.
</p><br><p>Fromund ran his gaze over Adam’s weapon, nodded deeply, and turned around. He wouldn’t do that in the Dead Lands, it was too dangerous, but he didn’t believe Adam would attack him from behind.
</p><br><p>That was behavior unworthy of a true warrior.
</p><br><br><p>Feeling a dull ache in his stomach, Fromund smiled bitterly as he walked towards his stone case.
</p><br><p>At this time, the arena was filled with whispers, quiet conversations appearing faster and faster as they realized that once Fromund returned to the battle, they would lose their chance.
</p><br><p>The higher places were no exception.
</p><br><p>"What do you think? Who turned out to be stronger?"
</p><br><p>Osana turned to Baren, her tone was calm, but it was only a fake to hide how nervous she really was.
</p><br><p>"I know you’ve always been good at judging the abilities of others. You... you see everything..."
</p><br><p>After a few seconds, Baren leaned over, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
</p><br><p>"One of them suffered an external wound due to a physical blow, the other didn’t follow the enemy Spirit and is now suffering from an internal injury. The internal one is much worse, anyone who mastered the aura to any degree realizes that."
</p><br><p>Then, he sighed heavily, shaking his head.
</p><br><p>"But... If I were in Adam’s place, I’d be wary, no, more like scared that I didn’t notice how my enemy got in front of me, considering that Fromund though strong, is not that fast."
</p><br><p>This was not good news for Osana, but she realized that it was too early to draw conclusions.
</p><br><br><p>Gladius smirked, standing in the distance, his gaze shifting to Osana who flinched at Baren’s response.
</p><br><p>’You can be calm, you can be nervous, or you can not care, it doesn’t affect anything. Hahaha, you can only watch.’
</p><br><p>A predatory glint traveled across his eyes, heading to another part of the arena.
</p><br><br><p>Zarot and Mariel sat next to each other. Mariel was calm, she was more often looking at Osana than at the fighters, but Zarot was completely focused on the fight.
</p><br><p>A satisfied smirk was on his face for a long time, his arms crossed on his chest. His opinion was similar to Baren’s.
</p><br><p>"Well, well, looks like we made the right choice. What a quick dash... Impressive."
</p><br><br><p>With a sweep of his hand, Fromund opened his stone case, the heavy lid slightly warm due to the morning sun flying off to the side, sinking into the ground with its sharp angle.
</p><br><p>Then, Fromund grabbed onto something, it seemed the object was heavy and massive as he struggled to lift his Nexus.
</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam flinched, the scene of the Plague Reaper pulling his scythe out of the ominous coffin appearing in his mind.
</p><br><p>Sure, Fromund had a case and not a coffin, though not the most conventional and he wasn’t a monster, and also... his weapon wasn’t a scythe.
</p><br><p>"Ugh, sometimes I wonder why my Nexus is so heavy."
</p><br><p>Fromund sighed heavily, slinging the massive stone hammer onto his shoulder.
</p><br><p>Dark veins ran between the stones, they looked like withered lava, ready to return to its original state at any moment when the heat was powerful enough.
</p><br><p>The handle of the hammer was thick and sturdy, Fromund’s hand barely gripped the cold rod, there was no comfortable handle for his weapon.
</p><br><p>The top of the hammer was huge and double-edged, the size of Fromund’s torso. It was obvious to everyone, even a child, what kind of power a direct strike with such a weapon possessed.
</p><br><p>"Hahaha..." Adam let out a short laugh.
</p><br><br><p>This confused Fromund, his eyebrow raised with a questioning look.
</p><br><p>"So... a small needle against a huge hammer more like a cooled piece of rock ejected from an active volcano than a weapon. I see..." Enjoy new stories from Freewebnovel
</p><br><p>Then, he swung the needle, slicing through the air in front of him.
</p><br><p>"I haven’t fought such an opponent yet. Go ahead, attack!"</p>
