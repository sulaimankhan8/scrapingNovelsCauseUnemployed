            <br><br><p>Nirosh's scream echoed through the arena, his wide-open eyes clearly showing how terrified he was, that single emotion overriding all the pain he was now feeling.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Energy surged through Nirosh, his eyes glowing brightly as the silhouette of a massive blue flower appeared behind him. The tips of the petals trembled, swaying from side to side, bright dots showing at the edges as if before a powerful explosion.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes narrowed.</p><br><br><br><p>At the same moment, Nirosh's head sank deeper into the wall, shattering his concentration and preventing him from finishing what he'd started.</p><br><p>The silhouette of the flower shuddered, dissipating in quick clots of energy, unable to find its use.</p><br><p>"What happened? Did you think I would wait quietly while you rained down all your powers on me?"</p><br><p>His grip remained just as powerful, Nirosh wanted to escape, attacking Adam with one hand in his stomach, he tried to loosen Adam's grip, but... Nirosh didn't have the strength to damage Adam's Nexus.</p><br><p>In his desperate attempts, he cut his fingers on the strings on the gauntlets, blood trickled down his arm, reaching his elbow where they fell to the ground in the same spot.</p><br><br><p>Beneath Nirosh, a dark pool of blood quickly formed, joining the larger one - flowing out of the open wound from his severed arm, touching Adam's black boots.</p><br><p>"And? That's it?" Adam asked, it wasn't mocking, it was sincere.</p><br><br><p>With a sweep of his arm, Adam tossed Nirosh aside, his back crashing against the hard surface, sinking into a thick layer of dust. Read new chapters at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Before Nirosh could do anything, Adam arrived in front of him like a specter of death.</p><br><br><p>A wide crimson blade slid into Nirosh's left leg, slicing through the flesh, passing through his bone and the ground beneath him like a massive nail on the lid of his soon-to-be coffin.</p><br><p>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHH!!!!"</p><br><p>A painful scream ripped from Nirosh's throat, instilling terror in the spectators unprepared for such a gruesome sight.</p><br><p>Sure... during the battle between Adam and Fromund, each of them had received quite a few serious wounds, but they hardly ever screamed in pain, always holding back and maintaining their belligerent spirit like true warriors.</p><br><p>Nirosh... In the eyes of the onlookers, he seemed as though it was the first time in his life that he received such wounds since his reaction was vivid and genuine.</p><br><p>Lifting his head from the ground, clenching his teeth tightly, Nirosh looked forward. His gaze locked onto the long dark mark on the ground left by Adam's blood.</p><br><p>It was no secret that Adam was at his limit, the blood reminded Nirosh of that.</p><br><p>And... it gave him hope.</p><br><p>'Right... All I need to do is attack once. I can't lose to someone like him! He's a commoner, and I'm a high nobleman! We're completely different!'</p><br><br><p>Abruptly, the hilt turned, and the sword tilted back, tearing through Nirosh's flesh with its saw-like half.</p><br><p>Nirosh's veins bulged, and his muscles tensed, he tried to endure the pain to concentrate and use at least one more ability - he believed it was enough to win.</p><br><p>But, this did not go unnoticed by his opponent towering over him like a ruthless hunter over his terrified prey.</p><br><p>"You know... This whole thing started because of you. Instead of trying like all normal people to conquer Osana's heart with your actions to get her favorable through time and effort, you decided to take the easy way and take advantage of your status."</p><br><p>The sword continued to tilt slowly, cutting his leg wider and wider, Nirosh didn't react in any way, gathering energy at one point, and gradually he succeeded.</p><br><p>Then, after a few seconds, his eyes shone brightly again as the powerful energy was ready to burst out of his body.</p><br><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Adam's gaze grew darker.</p><br><p>"Fromund lost his right arm, and now you don't have one either."</p><br><p>He stared at Nirosh's wound, the blood still actively flowing outward, soaking into the ground.</p><br><p>"But... I lost something too. So it's only fair if I get compensation from you. You don't think so?"</p><br><p>Nirosh's face turned as pale as a sheet of paper, filling with horror at the meaning behind Adam's words.</p><br><br><p>Before he could use his ability, a black flash headed towards him, splitting the wind currents.</p><br><br><p>Two fingers pulled his right eye in a sharp motion, ripping out of his head as the price for Adam's one.</p><br><p>"You don't need this anymore." Adam said coldly, clenching his fist tightly.</p><br><br><p>Clots of blood spurted out through the gaps in Adam's fingers, under Nirosh's startled gaze.</p><br><br><p>Fists slammed into the barrier, trying to destroy it, blue waves traveling along the transparent walls separating the spectator seats from the arena.</p><br><p>Some of the spectators shifted their gazes to the side - to see Zarot, who with a face full of anger was trying to destroy the barrier.</p><br><p>"Stop that little bastard now! This crossed all reasonable boundaries! Nirosh isn't even a fighter! I order you!"</p><br><p>It was unlikely that he would dare to do something like this in any other situation, but... right now, his son was being torn apart, in front of his eyes.</p><br><p>"Hahahahahaha! You have no power here Zarot Mazro!"</p><br><p>Kogen's laughter, like a thunder strike, spread throughout the arena, enjoying the desperation, madness, and pure brutality he desired - he missed it throughout the fight.</p><br><p>"Stop joking around! He's going to kill him! Nirosh is a high nobleman, he's my son! If he doesn't leave this arena alive, you won't get away with it! I swear on the name of my family!"</p><br><p>His fiery speech was not finished, Zarot clearly wanted to say something else, but... as he saw Kogen's emotionless look, he fell silent.</p><br><p>There was no anger or rage in Kogen's gaze, he just didn't care, showing that his opinion as well as his son's life didn't matter.</p><br><p>"No..." Zarot muttered in a shaky voice, feeling, so helpless and pathetic for the first time.</p><br><br><p>The thick chain shuddered as Adam's fingers went wide, breaking it into links, releasing his grip on the sword.</p><br><p>"You didn't even tell Fromund that this was a lethal fight as an option... How mean, but... I was prepared to kill from the start, and it didn't matter who my target was."</p><br><p>Terror consumed Nirosh's gaze as his eye reflected Adam's hand, drawing closer to him with the sole intention - to kill.</p>
