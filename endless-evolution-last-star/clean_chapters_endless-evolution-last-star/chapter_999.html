            <br><p>Unexpectedly, Heret had to face three Light Legion warriors that neither he nor any other serpent from the resistance had encountered.</p><br><p>The three Light Goliaths stood serenely behind the golden line. They were in no hurry to attack, glaring at the tiny man and the same serpent.</p><br><p>If a Light Guardian could grab Adam and crush him with two hands because of the difference in their size, a Light Goliath could do the same by pinching Adam between two fingers.</p><br><p>Two of the three goliaths stood behind. They held great stone bows, with bright golden light coming out of the cracks. The bows were almost as large as themselves, with a small platform at the bottom, since they shot relying on the ground rather than holding on with two hands.</p><br><p>In front stood the third Light Goliath. He was no different from the other two except for his weapon, a great war hammer, half axe with a broad blade, half hammer.</p><br><p>There was something else that set the Light Goliaths apart from all the other Light Legion troops - the intense energy running through their bodies.</p><br><p>Adam noticed it almost immediately.</p><br><p>The archers had energy running through their bows, returning to their feet for more grip. Presumably, each shot had such a powerful recoil that it could throw even these huge creatures aside.</p><br><p>The warrior, in turn, possessed a powerful, calm yet threatening aura. Golden streams ran down his arm, filling the hilt of the heavy weapon with power.</p><br><p>Adam slowly turned toward Heret.</p><br><p>"What are we going to do? I use the artifact, and you turn into a serpent?"</p><br><p>After a few moments, Heret narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>Something caught his keen eye - the light was coming out from under their chest plates, almost imperceptible, but making Heret's instincts nervous.</p><br><p>"Hmm... Let me think about it. Luckily, our three big friends are giving us time for that."</p><br><p>Adam nodded, his gaze running to the dividing line.</p><br><p>"Looks like until we get into the bridge lands, then they won't act. At least for now, they have enough patience for that."</p><br><br><p>Heret rubbed his chin thoughtfully, mulling over all their options.</p><br><p>"The problem is that we can definitely beat them. Their size can be intimidating, but I'm sure you can feel it." Heret glanced at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam nodded. "Sure. They're not S5 monsters. They're very strong like S4 monsters, but not above that border. If I use my most powerful abilities, I'll crush them!"</p><br><p>"Don't be in a hurry!"</p><br><p>Heret abruptly stopped him with a wave of his hand. Adam's energy increased dangerously.</p><br><p>"That's exactly what I want to avoid."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"We don't know if we can defeat Arnoth, so to maximize our chances, we must come at Arnoth at our peak. If you use your strongest abilities now, where will that get us?</p><br><p>"Only to your exhaustion. Even if you can use your abilities one more time against Arnoth, you'll come to him at 70-80% of your strength. We need at least 95%!"</p><br><p>A grimness covered Adam's face as he bit his lip.</p><br><p>"Right, you're right, but do we have any other choice?" he looked at the three goliaths. "I doubt we can beat them with our bare fists. They're fucking huge!"</p><br><p>Then, Heret nodded deeply as green flames ran across his arms.</p><br><br><p>"Let's do it this way - we use the minimum of force. Our job is to rip the protective plate off their chests. I think there's something in there. Maybe a core, their weak spot, something like that."</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, and gradually he could see it too.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, the first needle appeared in his right hand.</p><br><p>Although the Branch Order had become one of his most powerful abilities, it didn't require much energy to activate, especially if he only used one needle. It became his trump card that he could use as a regular card in any situation.</p><br><p>Heret did a similar thing. His flames were not as dark as usual.</p><br><p>First, they should find out if their enemies had any weaknesses.</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, turning into a flash. Heret immediately followed him.</p><br><p>The warrior goliath as well as the archers, took no action.</p><br><p>Until Adam and Heret crossed the line.</p><br><br><p>In a heartbeat, the archers drew huge stone arrows from behind their backs, pulling the golden bowstrings. With each movement, the space shook as cracks traveled across the bridge from the heavy bows.</p><br><p>The warrior's eyes flashed with a cruel light as he clutched his battle hammer tightly with both hands.</p><br><p>The sharp blade rained down upon Adam, leaving a furrow on the surface.</p><br><p>Without delay, two figures ran out of the cloud of dust. The warrior missed.</p><br><p>"Well, well..." Adam muttered, running along the hilt of the hammer as he leaped at the goliath's hands. "When you're that big, it's hard to hit small targets, right? Your weapon won't cut us, it'll crush us, still, you need to hit first!"</p><br><p>Heret's eyes darted towards the archers, filling with concern. They were ready to fire, their hands trembling. As soon as Heret and Adam showed themselves from behind the warrior's back, they would release the bowstrings.</p><br><p>The warrior tried to throw Adam off with his arm, yet he was too slow.</p><br><p>They both turned into shadows, finding themselves on opposite sides of the warrior's chest. The heavy protective plate shook, releasing thick streams of light.</p><br><p>'Right, I can see it now!' Adam inwardly exclaimed, the darkness thickening around his needle.</p><br><p>In a flame surge, Heret swept in front of the plate, leaving a long trail of fire. It wasn't enough to break it, but it worked for Adam.</p><br><p>"Good, that's all I needed!" Adam's eyes flashed as he took a wide horizontal swing.</p><br><p>The dark blade traveled across the molten plate, slicing it in two like a red-hot knife through butter.</p><br><p>Pieces of metal crumbled to the ground, revealing a tiny core, smaller than the palm of his hand, at the very center of the Light Goliath's chest.</p><br><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>'All this power, all this energy is coming from that core?'</p>
