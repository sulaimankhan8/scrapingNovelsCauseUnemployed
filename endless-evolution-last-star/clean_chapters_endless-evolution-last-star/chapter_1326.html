            <h4>Chapter 1326: Loss of Effectiveness</h4><br><p>While Norax and Narica discussed plans and the situation, as well as the mysterious object that was unique to the Forgotten Mills, Adam’s patience came to an end.
</p><br><br><p>With a menacing stride, Adam climbed to the top floor and, without warning, burst onto the balcony, staring intently at them.
</p><br><p>"Oh, Adam," Norax smirked. "Shouldn’t you be continuing to rebuild your Energy Axis? As far as I know, you just ate and should be full of energy, right?"
</p><br><p>In response, Adam waved his hand.
</p><br><p>"It’s useless! I spent a month and only got 5%! Do you want me to die of old age in your mill?"
</p><br><p>Norax touched his chin thoughtfully. "Well, that would be problematic, although you wouldn’t be the first to die within these walls."
</p><br><p>Narica nodded calmly in agreement.
</p><br><p>"Hmm, and what do you suggest? I think you understand that we are already doing everything in our power to help you."
</p><br><p>Adam clenched his fist. "Just let me do the same thing I did on the first day!"
</p><br><p>"Oh." A glint flashed across Norax’s eyes. "Are you talking about how you bit my maid? Aren’t you afraid that will make me jealous?"
</p><br><p>Narica’s face turned red in an instant.
</p><br><p>"Sir! What are you saying!"
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam decided to consider this option seriously.
</p><br><p>"Agh?" He tilted his head. "Will that help? I can’t say it was pleasant, but if Narica’s blood can speed up the process, then I’m ready!"
</p><br><p>"Hahaha! Sometimes I think you forget which one of us is a monster and which one is a human. The only reason you survived last time was because your Energy Axis was fully open, and even Narica’s dense energy couldn’t reach your Evolution Tree.
</p><br><p>"However, now that 20% of your Energy Axis has been restored, the risks are much higher, and the effectiveness may not be as high as you expect. You won’t be able to make your body respond to stress the same way it did the first time."
</p><br><p>Adam crossed his arms over his chest.
</p><br><p>"Hey, I’m not going to waste any more of my time. Are you saying there’s no better way than what I’m doing now? It’s too slow!"
</p><br><p>Norax understood what Adam wanted. In fact, he had no reason to refuse him.
</p><br><p>"Fine." Norax waved his hand as he glanced at Narica. "Fight him until he can’t stand up. Increase the difficulty level gradually to keep Adam on his toes. If it helps him with the Energy Axis, you’ll keep doing it as long as it’s effective."
</p><br><p>Narica wasn’t sure it would work, because monsters usually took years or even decades to rebuild their Energy Axis. For her, it was a natural process that required time and patience.
</p><br><p>The time aspect was debatable, but they both understood that patience was not Adam’s strong suit.
</p><br><p>"Yes, sir, as you wish."
</p><br><p>Before Adam could comprehend this, Narica was standing in front of him.
</p><br><p>"You’re one of those who likes to fight, right? Well, I’m ready to satisfy your desire."
</p><br><p>Narica grabbed Adam by the wrist and deftly threw him over her shoulder, tossing him outside the Norax’s mill.
</p><br><p>Then, she bowed slightly to Norax and followed Adam.
</p><br><p>Both inside Norax’s empty mill and around it, there was enough space for two large armies to battle each other. For Adam and Narica, this was an advantage as they began their fight on the dark field among the gray grass.
</p><br><p>Norax, in turn, simply leaned on the railing and took a sip of coffee with a satisfied smile on his face.
</p><br><p>"I’m one of those who prefer to play, there’s no doubt about that, but..." He thought as Narica’s fist slammed into Adam’s face. "Sometimes it’s nice to be a simple spectator and watch from the sidelines, isn’t it?"
</p><br><br><p>Narica did everything Norax told her to do. If she wanted to, she could have killed Adam with a single blow, but now her punches were of medium strength, allowing Adam to block them and remain on his feet.
</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam was doing his best to react to her attacks and try to counterattack, but as soon as he adapted, Narica just increased her power.
</p><br><p>"Hey..." Silvana’s voice echoed in Adam’s mind as a barrage of blows rained down on him. "Maybe we should try to wear you down? I mean, we can use our most powerful abilities against Narica, even if it’s just a training fight."
</p><br><p>However, Adam had a better idea.
</p><br><p>"Nah, I’ll know there’s no threat in front of me because Narica wouldn’t dare hurt me. If I’m not in danger, I won’t progress, at least not as fast as I want to."
</p><br><p>"Hmm? What do you plan to do in that case?"
</p><br><br><p>Adam crossed his arms in front of him, blocking Narica’s punch, which threw him to the side. She immediately lunged forward, intending to knock him to the ground.
</p><br><p>"Well, I have a plan, but you have to promise not to get mad at me. I’m only doing this to rebuild my Energy Axis."
</p><br><p>Silvana raised an eyebrow in confusion. She didn’t remember Adam ever asking her for anything like this before.
</p><br><p>"Sure, I don’t think you can surprise me after everything we’ve been through. I’ve long since gotten used to my Phantom being a reckless fool."
</p><br><br><p>"Hah, remember, no one forced you to say that."
</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam dodged the blow and spun around to attack Narica from the side.
</p><br><p>"Pffft, is that all you’ve got?" She snorted, easily stopping his leg to the right of her head. She just squeezed his ankle slightly.
</p><br><br><p>"No! That’s not all!"
</p><br><p>Narica decided to give him a chance, but none of his many blows could reach their target. No matter which side Adam attacked from or how he attacked, Narica easily blocked or dodged everything until... until something terrible happened.
</p><br><br><p>Adam appeared in front of Narica, but instead of striking, he reached out and grabbed her left breast.
</p><br><p>"Oops, it was an accident!" he said with a chuckle.</p>
