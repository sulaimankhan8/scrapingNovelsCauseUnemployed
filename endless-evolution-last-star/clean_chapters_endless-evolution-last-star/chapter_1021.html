            <h4>Chapter 1021: Imaginary Cut (Part 3)</h4><br><p>A joyful smile covered Silvana’s face as she saw the many cracks on the fifth orb join together.
</p><br><p>That could only mean one thing - she achieved her goal.
</p><br><br><p>At the next strike of the Stellar Flow, the fifth orb shattered, covering Silvana’s excited expression with the bright light from the oncoming energy flow.
</p><br><p>For a moment, she forgot about the pain, her broken arm, and her bloody hand. For the last few minutes, she kept hitting an object stronger than a steel wall.
</p><br><p>If Adam had been here, one light blow would have been enough to shatter the fifth orb, but Silvana had to put her own effort, blood, and pain into it.
</p><br><p>Then, the Stellar Flow swept forward, bringing Silvana the relief she so desired.
</p><br><p>She felt she finally did what she had to do, and now it was her turn to be rewarded.
</p><br><br><p>But, as soon as she saw a few black currents amidst the flawless Stellar Flow, she realized something was wrong.
</p><br><p>Before she could figure out what was happening, the black currents pierced through her body like sharp spears. Each one aimed at the place where Adam had a wound. The more severe the wound, the coarser the spear was.
</p><br><p>At the last moment, Silvana’s eyes jerked upward to the Evolution Tree.
</p><br><p>Her mind quickly picked apart all its words as a bitter smile appeared on Silvana’s face.
</p><br><p>"I see... From the beginning, it wasn’t a necessity or a last resort because of Adam’s imminent death... I and his wounds... were always part of the condition for the final gate."
</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree said nothing, but Silvana didn’t need its words.
</p><br><p>As soon as the black spears pierced her, she realized everything.
</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.
</p><br><p>As the Stellar Flow reached the Evolution Tree, the cracks appeared in a new place - on the Crystal Gates. There were no more orbs left on them, all six were destroyed just as five gates were opened.
</p><br><p>That was the end for the Crystal Gates and the Stellar Flow - the path to the last key was clear.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>The black spears shuddered when Silvana’s eyes opened wide in vivid pain.
</p><br><p>Her physical body and energy form were taking damage at the same time, no matter what world she was in.
</p><br><p>Her right arm exploded, and the fabric from her back ripped off, leaving torn wounds as hundreds of cuts and bruises covered her torso, arms, and legs.
</p><br><p>All the wounds that Adam received during his long fight against Arnoth, Silvana had to endure in an instant.
</p><br><p>She wanted to scream in pain, yet she didn’t have the strength even for that. Her throat was on fire from the muffled cry as the bright light prevented her eyes from plunging into darkness.
</p><br><p>Beyond the Evolution Tree opened a gap to reveal something that belonged to her, her gift from the Evolution Tree - the Evolution Sprout.
</p><br><p>"What... What is it doing here?" Silvana whispered, lost.
</p><br><p>[You did a good job... Silvana...]
</p><br><p>Even the Evolution Tree couldn’t hide its praise.
</p><br><p>[Now, everything will be fine... You and Adam, you both have a chance to defeat Arnoth and Lost Light in battle... right now!]
</p><br><p>At the Evolution Tree’s exclamation, the Evolution Sprout trembled, heading towards the great tree in a bright flash.
</p><br><p>The young sprout that once should be a tree if it had been planted in a soil instead of growing amongst the darkness, was undergoing major changes.
</p><br><p>Thin branches stretched forward as well as the base, curling around the Evolution Tree’s great trunk.
</p><br><p>But, Silvana’s sprout did not become another branch.
</p><br><p>Ripple. Ripple. Ripple.
</p><br><p>As soon as the sprout joined the Evolution Tree, its branches began to pulse, white lines running back and forth in an endless circle, making the branches shake slightly like veins that pumped blood.
</p><br><p>Now, Silvana wasn’t just connected to Adam’s energy, she was part of Adam’s power.
</p><br><p>[Good... Silvana... You and Adam will soon learn the details of what just happened, right after your victory... But first... You must forget about your pain...]
</p><br><p>Silvana shuddered, struggling to get up from the ground. "What are you talking about, devious tree?"
</p><br><p>[Heh... Now, you know the same thing, Adam... Not just the memories and your feelings... No... You have become part of his new power, so it is up to you to teach it to him.]
</p><br><p>Before she could say anything, a black and white ray flew straight out of the Evolution Tree, piercing her chest.
</p><br><p>Her eyes went wide, filling with meaning.
</p><br><br><p>"Gha... Gha... Gha..."
</p><br><p>Adam’s heavy breaths rasped through the castle, his exhausted gaze watching the golden ring, the symbols were near the very center.
</p><br><p>With no doubt of his victory, Arnoth controlled the flow of energy, for him, everything was decided.
</p><br><p>"Don’t hold any anger towards me, Adam..." he muttered, directing his gaze to the young man who was struggling to stand on his feet. "As much as I wish it, under our circumstances, there is no way we can be allies, only enemies. Only one of us can survive.
</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Arnoth’s expression froze as he was unable to say another word.
</p><br><p>Something in Adam’s aura changed. Arnoth’s monster instincts told him that something was wrong.
</p><br><p>In a powerful burst, white flames engulfed Adam, giving him more energy than he had before the battle.
</p><br><p>All the power that lurked in the last part of the Stellar Flow and the Crystal Gates now belonged to him.
</p><br><p>This surprised Adam and alarmed Arnoth.
</p><br><p>But, soon enough, an emotion appeared on Arnoth’s face that he hadn’t shown once during their long fight - fear.
</p><br><p>Amidst the white flames, the outline of a girl with black hair and green eyes appeared. It was a spectral copy of her, transparent and bright from the shimmering energy, but it was obvious to everyone who it was.
</p><br><p>Then, Arnoth and Lost Light saw Adam’s Operator.
</p><br><p>Adam, in turn, met Silvana for the first time right on the battlefield.
</p><br><br><p>Silvana smiled weakly before running her single hand across his chest.
</p><br><p>Adam gasped. "Silvana... you are..."
</p><br><p>"Hush," she hissed softly, snuggling against his shoulder.
</p><br><p>Her frame shook while streams of energy fluttered her hair like a strong wind.
</p><br><p>"Never forget, I’m always with you... It’s time to do what you must - win!"
</p><br><p>Fragments of non-existent memories, silhouettes fighting against monsters, defeat and sacrifice, and clasped scissors flashed among her wide-open eyes.
</p><br><p>"In order to achieve the desired reality, we will use an imaginary story... That is our power..."</p>
