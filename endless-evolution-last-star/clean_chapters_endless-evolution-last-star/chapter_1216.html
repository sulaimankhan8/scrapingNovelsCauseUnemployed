            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1216: Lightning Threat (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Now, everything depended on Adam and Fromund.</p><br><p>Moroya was right. Help would not arrive in time, but it did not seem like any of them were rushing to call for it. Despite facing five powerful monsters, each strong enough to face an Elder in equal combat, they still believed in their victory.</p><br><p>Perhaps it wouldn’t have been a mistake if Bathild hadn’t received power from outside. Only she knew who was hiding behind the mysterious identity of the Exarch, but it was obvious to everyone that it was someone important from the Dark Shore.</p><br><p>The energy Bathild received, the mark on her chest, and the core showed that this power did not belong to her.</p><br><p>It was unknown how long Bathild could maintain this combat form, but it was clear that Adam and Fromund would have to fight for their lives every second of it.</p><br><p>“Hey, Adam…” Fromund’s voice became lower, more serious, befitting the situation. “What are we going to do? We have to decide who fights whom.”</p><br><p>However, Adam didn’t seem to hear him.</p><br><br><p>Ignoring everyone but Bathild, he strode confidently toward her, seeing many rapidly changing silhouettes behind her, led by the grinning Essence Thunder Demon.</p><br><p>He couldn’t explain it, but he felt that the Exarch, the monster that had given Bathild her power, was connected to the Thunder Demon, and possibly many other thunder monsters, considering Bathild herself.</p><br><p>Perhaps she had not yet reached her peak, where her genes could manifest themselves, or perhaps she lacked the talent to do so and therefore needed outside help to deal with Adam.</p><br><p>In any case, now not only was Adam interested in fighting and defeating her, but his Path Construct was as well.</p><br><p>“Hey, are you here?” Adam asked, looking at Bathild, whose gaze was fixed on the ground. “You’ve gotten stronger, I can feel it. Show me what you’re capable of now!”</p><br><p>Bathild looked up sharply as their eyes met. A shiver ran through Adam’s body. His instincts told him to dodge the impending attack or even run away, but he remained in his spot, waiting for her next move.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Bathild did not rush at him like a wild beast. She needed time to get used to her new power, which in the first few seconds felt like energy trying to tear her body apart.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The seal on her chest trembled as a dense stream of energy emerged from the crystal, forming into a weapon.</p><br><p>The others watched the beginning of the confrontation between Bathild and Adam. They didn’t want to interfere because they didn’t know what state Bathild was in.</p><br><p>Perhaps if Moroya and the princes had decided to interfere, Bathild would have attacked them. That would definitely not have ended well for the Queen.</p><br><br><p>Bathild gripped the hilt of her sword tightly, bright runes burning on the dark blade, while electric discharges emanated from the edged guard.</p><br><p>“Now, you have no choice but to fall by my hand, Adam Vinter.” Bathild gritted her teeth. “This is the will of the Befallen Crown, and I will carry it out at any cost.”</p><br><p>Adam’s grin widened.</p><br><p>“Hah, you’re still thinking about something other than the fight? Do someone else’s desires matter? All you should be thinking about is how to defeat me! How to kill me! And how to get the title you so…!”</p><br><p>Before Adam could finish, Bathild vanished. In her place was a lone electric discharge, and in the next instant, a sharp blade flashed before Adam’s eyes.</p><br><p>A needle raised in time saved Adam from death, otherwise, Bathild’s sword would have cut off his head by now.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>A shockwave accompanied by electric discharges erupted in the cave, throwing Adam high into the air.</p><br><p>Before his back could reach the ceiling, Bathild caught up with him and launched another attack. Gradually, they rose higher and higher until they returned to the surface, where they would have to determine who was the strongest among the meteorite debris.</p><br><p>Thus, Fromund was left alone against four. He didn’t mind fighting against a large number of opponents, it was his strong point, but…</p><br><p>‘Damn, if these are the kind of opponents, it might be difficult.’ Fromund scratched the back of his head uncertainly.</p><br><p>At the same time, Marhen stared intently at Fromund, then at Moroya with the two princes. His gaze was dark, his mind processing everything that had happened.</p><br><p>He had an important decision to make, and he had to choose something.</p><br><p>Marhen, with his intelligence, understood how important it was.</p><br><p>He couldn’t afford to make a mistake.</p><br><p>That was why he knew what he had to do.</p><br><p>After taking one last look at Moroya, he looked up and rushed toward the surface.</p><br><p>“I will help you, Miss Bathild!”</p><br><p>Even Kirani Bug, hiding around the corner, felt that this was unnecessary. If Bathild couldn’t defeat Adam in her current state, the best tactic for the monsters would be to quickly deal with Fromund.</p><br><p>In that case, even if Adam won, he would be badly injured and unable to deal with Moroya, the two princes, and Marhen on his own.</p><br><p>However, for some reason, Marhen made that decision.</p><br><p>Was it a mistake, or…?</p><br><p>“Hah, looks like he’s too worried about his boss!” Fromund smirked as he cracked his neck. “Alright, so it’s one against three, I can do this!”</p><br><p>Moroya raised an eyebrow, surprised.</p><br><p>“Young man, if your partner had said that, I might have believed you, but judging by your aura, you’re still at the beginning of the K4-Level. Well, not quite, but what are your chances against three Elders?”</p><br><p>Then, Fromund stretched out his arm, summoning his spear, while his Initial Order remained active.</p><br><p>“If you’re so confident, then attack, but I’m afraid I’ll have to do something bad to your boys!” Fromund aimed his spear at the two princes, showing Moroya only a confident smirk.</p><br><p>Moroya frowned. She hadn’t seen Fromund fight, but from his confident gaze, she knew the battle would not be easy.</p><br><p>Especially considering that Marhen had decided to leave, reducing their chances of victory.</p>
