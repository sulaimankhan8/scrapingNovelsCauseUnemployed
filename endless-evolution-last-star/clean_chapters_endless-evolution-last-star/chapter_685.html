            <br><p>Slash. Slash. Slash.
</p><br><p>Two flashes, white and crimson ones, collided time after time inside the confines of the arena. A long needle slammed into a heavy spear, a cascade of sparks flying off to the sides, only for the flashes to jump back and repeat the same scenario.
</p><br><p>The Solitary Commander and Adam moved at the same pace, with serious expressions and eyes full of the desire to tear their opponent apart.
</p><br><p>Yet, neither of them managed to inflict a serious wound on the other, a few scratches were all they achieved and Adam was not satisfied with that.
</p><br><p>’Hmm... I can’t be faster than him, I doubt I can get stronger, but... I can sacrifice one attack to end the fight quickly.’
</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam rushed forward, as did the Solitary Commander. In a heartbeat, they clashed again, but this time Adam kept his hands much lower, putting his right shoulder under the hit.
</p><br><p>It didn’t take long for an experienced fighter like the Solitary Commander to realize that this was the perfect opportunity to attack. His spear was occupied by a silver needle, but the Solitary Commander had another weapon that was always with him.
</p><br><br><p>A long tail swept forward, parting the wind currents. At the last moment, Adam tilted his shoulder, he expected it to happen, yet the sharp tip sliced through his coat, leaving a light cut.
</p><br><br><p>Adam gripped the Solitary Commander’s tail tightly, a smirk formed on his face as he threw an arrogant glare at his opponent.
</p><br><p>"Hah, you fell into such an easy trap. I received one cut, but the consequences for you will be far worse!"
</p><br><p>Without hesitation, the needle plunged into the Solitary Commander’s chest, in the center of the bud. Adam realized that his adversary had a good level of defense, but he was sure that it wouldn’t be an obstacle for his needle, especially with thrust.
</p><br><p>However... the Solitary Commander didn’t even budge. Waves of shivers ran through his body, but his armor successfully absorbed the full force of Adam’s strike.
</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam’s eyes went wide.
</p><br><p>He expected a lot from the Solitary Commander, but he was sure that there were no barriers to his needle.
</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could realize anything, the Solitary Commander spun around sharply striking Adam in the stomach with the back of his spear.
</p><br><p>The impact threw Adam to the other side of the square, causing him to fall next to the barrier.
</p><br><br><p>In the blink of an eye, the Solitary Commander was in front of Adam, bringing his spear down on him. Without falling into panic, Adam effortlessly blocked the first slash, then another and another.
</p><br><p>In fact, this unsuccessful skirmish gave him confidence, Adam became faster, the needle blade reaching its target time after time, but...
</p><br><p>’Something’s wrong... I can’t even scratch his defense plates. If this keeps up, I’ll just waste all my strength trying to break through his armor.’
</p><br><p>Absorbed in thought, Adam didn’t notice the Solitary Commander swinging his spear to the side, thrusting his left arm forward.
</p><br><br><p>Five sharp claws clenched Adam’s face, the Solitary Commander’s grip was powerful enough to hold him in place.
</p><br><p>Adam grabbed his wrist, trying to break the Solitary Commander’s clutch, but his opponent’s attack wasn’t going to be long.
</p><br><p>Without delay, the Solitary Commander threw Adam forward with all his might, leaving five deep cuts on his face from his sharp claws.
</p><br><br><p>With a thud, Adam’s back slammed into the nearest wall. Usually, because he was a Phantom and his body was strong, all obstacles would break in his path until he gradually slowed down, but not this time.
</p><br><br><p>Adam gasped, his mouth opened wide in vivid pain as did his eyes with trembling pupils. The wall cracked only slightly, becoming not a softening cushion for him, but the added stress of colliding with a solid surface.
</p><br><p>His back, muscles, and bones had to endure the unfamiliar pressure before the pain began to gradually subside.
</p><br><p>Stay tuned to NovelBin.Côm
</p><br><p>Basically, Adam felt the same as if a normal person was thrown into a wall. The only difference was that a normal person’s body would have exploded from the force of the monster’s toss, but... for Adam, this was just another stage in the battle.
</p><br><p>At that moment, Silvana was about to say something, but seeing Adam’s expression, she decided not to disobey his orders and continued to remain silent.
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, before continuing the fight, Adam canceled his First Order, the silver needle shattering into light particles slowly passing in front of his deep eyes.
</p><br><br><p>The Solitary Commander stopped at the edge of the arena, looking Adam up and down, keeping his spear pointed towards the ground - he wasn’t going to attack Adam now.
</p><br><p>"Oh... That was really nasty."
</p><br><p>Adam stood up, shaking the dust off his knees. Then, he arched his back, trying to take away the deafening pain, his bones crunched in response bringing brief relief.
</p><br><p>Directing his gaze downward, Adam looked at his left arm, it was covered in blood due to the sharp tail that flew out of his grip like a whip.
</p><br><br><p>Dark drops of blood fell onto his wounded palm from the five cuts on his face, most trickling towards his nose, coming off the tip quickly.
</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Adam closed his eyes.
</p><br><br><p>Remaining in the dark, unafraid that the Solitary Commander would take advantage of his weakness, Adam ran a hand through his hair, slicking it back.
</p><br><p>The next moment when he opened his eyes, an amber grid appeared deep in his right eye, as dense silver threads traveled down his body.
</p><br><p>Was Adam going to use a weapon? He possessed several options.
</p><br><br><p>He already had the simplest and most effective one.
</p><br><br><p>Two fists slammed into each other with such force that the threads on his gauntlets shook, a distinct ringing spreading around.
</p><br><p>"I don’t know what’s wrong, but I can’t get through your armor, at least not with my needle."
</p><br><p>Then, his calm expression vanished, replaced by a sly smirk, and his muscles swelled for the coming fight.
</p><br><p>"In that case, I’ll just break you. I’ll tear you to pieces, your flesh and bones until I win!"</p>
