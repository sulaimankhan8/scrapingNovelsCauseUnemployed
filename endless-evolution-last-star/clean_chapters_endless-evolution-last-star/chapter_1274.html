            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1274: White Threads and Goal</strong></p><br><p>Adam reached the K4-Level and remained alive until now. This meant that he won much more often than he lost, which was definitely true.</p><br><p>Sure, he had suffered many defeats as well. Fortunately for him, none of them had led to his demise, although other Phantoms in his place had not been so lucky.</p><br><p>But… never in his life had Adam lost with such pleasure, and the fire in his eyes had not been so bright in a long time.</p><br><p>He was not angry with Gareyna and did not even want to attack her to prove that he was stronger; he understood that this was not the case.</p><br><p>All he wanted was to know how Gareyna did it and if he could ever reach her level.</p><br><p>It wasn’t that Adam wanted knights and guards made of threads to fight for him, but he couldn’t deny how much Gareyna’s control surpassed his.</p><br><br><p>As soon as Gareyna waved her hand, the net and guards trembled and disintegrated into threads. They headed toward her, disappearing into her white energy as if into pure flame.</p><br><p>Without saying a word, she filled Adam’s cup and pointed to his empty chair.</p><br><p>“It’s always nice to see a young man ready to learn something new. Sit down, our conversation isn’t over yet. After all, you don’t even know which faction I belong to yet.”</p><br><p>Adam did not argue and sat down next to her.</p><br><p>“So, what you saw…” Gareyna began before taking a sip of her favorite tea. “Other members of the White Tread have abilities similar to mine. As you understand, all owners of the white mills belong to this faction, including me.</p><br><p>“Some are weaker, some are stronger, some have better control, some have worse. It’s the same as everywhere else, there’s nothing unique about it. But, I must tell you that what you saw from me is not the limit of the thread mastery.”</p><br><p>At that moment, Adam’s eyes widened.</p><br><p>“What you did… How long did you train to achieve that level of control?”</p><br><p>In response, Gareyna shook her head.</p><br><p>“It’s not just about control, but about the path I chose. It’s no coincidence that other white mill owners have abilities similar to mine; that’s how our energy and abilities work.”</p><br><br><p>“So, the other two factions also have their own distinctive abilities, right?” Adam asked.</p><br><p>He didn’t know what lay behind the gray and black mills, but from Gareyna’s words, he could guess that they couldn’t create knights and guards from white threads like she did.</p><br><p>“Yes. The gray mills belong to the Gray Needle. I’m sure you understand what those words mean.”</p><br><br><br><p>“The Black Mills.” Adam jerked his hand. “Targon warned me not to go near the black mills. Why are they so dangerous?”</p><br><p>Gareyna nodded again. “Targon was right. If you had gone to one of them, you would most likely be dead by now. They belong to the Black Cut. I won’t hide it — they are the most dangerous and strict among us. And, most of the black mills are located on lands that intersect with the Renegades’ territory.”</p><br><p>“But… Why? I mean, you accepted me and even invited me for tea. I learned and saw many new things from you, even though you are one of the mill owners, albeit from another faction. Why would the black mills kill me?”</p><br><p>“Well… I think it will be easier to answer this question if I compare what would happen in each scenario. If you decided to ignore my mill and went to another white mill, you would be greeted with friendly intentions. Perhaps you would not be offered tea, but they would not attack you and would answer your questions.”</p><br><br><p>“You already know what would happen to you in the case of the Black Cut. They don’t accept strangers, especially if it’s a human who has abilities similar to theirs. One of them would challenge you to a fair fight, which you would lose. I think after my little demonstration, you understand that.”</p><br><p>From Gareyna’s aura, he sensed that she was a Lord, but Adam understood that in this case, it didn’t matter. If she had been an Elder, the outcome of the fight between them would have been the same. Sure, it wouldn’t have been as easy for Gareyna in that case.</p><br><p>Adam would have been able to tear her threads and destroy her guards, but a few attacks and complicated moves that Adam was incapable of would have ended their battle.</p><br><p>Then, as if trying to avoid the subject, Gareyna finally mentioned the last faction.</p><br><p>“And the Gray Needle. Well, I’m afraid that if you went to their mills, nothing would happen.”</p><br><p>“Hmm? What do you mean?”</p><br><br><p>“They would just ignore you. To be honest, I last saw many of them several decades ago. Damn, I’m not even sure if they’re still alive. Although… who am I kidding? Of course they’re alive.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply as he thought.</p><br><p>Gareyna’s story about the Forgotten Mills gave him an understanding of what to expect from these lands and who his potential enemies might be.</p><br><p>‘Hmm… The Black Cut, I won’t hide it, I want to fight them more than anything, but it would be certain death. I don’t know exactly what they are capable of, but if they are on the same level as me and have greater mastery of similar abilities, then I could be in trouble…’</p><br><p>Silvana’s voice rang in his head to help him make a decision.</p><br><p>‘Maybe go to the other white mills? Obviously, you can’t defeat Gareyna. They are too strong, and attacking her after everything would be too mean.’</p><br><p>Adam shook his head internally.</p><br><p>‘No, I can’t, not now. Gareyna said that others from the White Thread would help me as well. It definitely won’t be the victory I want.’</p><br><p>As if seeing the doubt in his sullen expression, Gareyna stared at him intently and asked:</p><br><p>“Hey, Adam… You came here for the Connected Heart to kill one of us, didn’t you?”</p>
