            <br><p>"Redcore Wolf? Glara, are you sure?" Natta asked with slight concern.</p><br><br><p>"I agree with her. I would reconsider if I were you. Redcore Wolf is the strongest of them all, he's not the most protected or fastest, but because his stats are above average, you just won't be able to adapt."</p><br><p>Before they could hear Glara's reply, they felt a threatening aura behind them, as if a shadow born from the darkness had come for their souls.</p><br><br><p>Gladius's heavy hands fell on their tiny shoulders, sending shivers down their bodies along with a chill across their spines.</p><br><p>"Hey, it's not good to plunge into doubt someone who's already made up their mind, is it?"</p><br><p>Knocking their teeth from fear, Sano and Natta nodded simultaneously.</p><br><p>"S-sure... I apologize for our impertinence."</p><br><p>Glara raised an eyebrow but did not say anything. It seemed like she didn't understand what caused Sano and Natta to have such a strange reaction.</p><br><p>"So... I can proceed? I mean, I chose a monster, right?" Glara asked uncertainly while looking at Aiden.</p><br><p>Aiden nodded calmly before tossing the black case with Code D to Gladius.</p><br><br><p>Reaching forward between Sano and Natta's heads, Gladius caught the case confidently, heading for the exit.</p><br><p>"Yes, follow Gladius. You will fight in the hall where we were before. Gladius will explain everything to you and Redcore Wolf will be here soon."</p><br><p>Glara took a deep breath and did as he said.</p><br><p>When the door closed, only Aiden, Sano, and Natta were left in the room. The girls were relieved when Gladius left, then they glanced at Aiden, not feeling annoyed or threatened by him.</p><br><br><p>"Sano, Natta, come here." Aiden said calmly, no anger could be heard in his voice.</p><br><p>However... Sano and Natta instinctively felt that they shouldn't expect anything good from Aiden.</p><br><p>They obeyed and carefully approached him.</p><br><p>"If you dare to open your mouth without permission again, interfering with an important process, then..." Aiden glanced at them, "No, I will not kill you. I will rip out your tongues without anesthesia, and you can be sure it will be a long time before I decide to take pity on you and cure you."</p><br><p>Sano and Natta only gulped.</p><br><p>After such a warning, they had no desire to talk. It was becoming too dangerous.</p><br><p>"Well, let's see how she does." Aiden uttered, getting up from his chair.</p><br><br><p>"I wanted to see what it would look like, but... it's a whole mountain of groceries." Leona muttered looking at the table where they put out everything they had bought.</p><br><p>Adam smiled slightly, sitting relaxed on the couch in the hall. Gary and Trici were still on the second floor minding their business, which was good though, since Adam and Leona could take their time.</p><br><p>"Where do we start? Are we going to make lasagna right away?" Adam asked after a while, watching as Leona quickly organized the groceries in the fridge, filling it in full.</p><br><p>After thinking for a few seconds, Leona shook her head.</p><br><p>"You and I did a good job, so we need a little rest. How about we try that expensive tea and cupcakes we bought?" Leona suggested, showing a metal cylinder with black tea leaves inside.</p><br><p>Adam nodded, he liked the idea of starting with dessert. After all, everyone liked to savor a little sweetness.</p><br><p>Taking a few steps forward, Adam took the cylinder and...</p><br><br><p>He opened the metal lid that was tightly closed.</p><br><br><br><p>The mechanical doors opened as several huge drones flew in, carrying a massive cage with Redcore Wolf inside.</p><br><p>Aiden did not weaken or injure the monster in any way since Glara could not become a Natural Phantom in that case. He had already had a similar experiment with Lana Tiates when the monster was weakened, but that was a different story.</p><br><p>Redcore Wolf did not try to get out, as it knew very well that it was impossible. The protective glass walls were too strong, Redcore Wolf couldn't even leave a scratch on it even though his claws were sharp.</p><br><br><p>The drones lowered the cage with Redcore Wolf, which was like a gift box falling apart, releasing the monster.</p><br><p>Redcore Wolf glanced at Glara, who was supposed to be his opponent but did not attack since Gladius was next to her. Against him... Redcore Wolf had as many chances as the ant in front of Glara.</p><br><p>With a wave of his hand, Gladius handed the case to Glara.</p><br><p>"When you're ready, open the case and stab Code D right into your neck. Good luck!" Gladius uttered with a sly smile before jumping high up.</p><br><p>He ended up in front of Aiden who was standing on the observation deck. Natta and Sano were beside him, as well as Shiny. The Spark Seeker was needed by Aiden to keep an eye on the changes in Glara's inner space.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, next to Natta and Sano, were two massive black cases whose purpose was unknown.</p><br><p>"Well... I can take one minute to set up for the fight, can't I?" Glara muttered with a glance at the black case.</p><br><br><p>"Agh... What a scent..." Adam uttered with pleasure glancing at the cup full of hot tea.</p><br><br><p>"I agree, but it's not the same without the cupcakes." Leona said, pulling out a few.</p><br><p>However, she didn't eat them right away. Instead, Leona pulled out a bottle of liqueur from the refrigerator, as well as a culinary steel syringe.</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>"Hmm? What are you going to do?" Adam asked in confusion.</p><br><p>Leona's corners of her lips went up.</p><br><p>"Don't worry about it. I just want to improve their flavor a little. Usually, you have to wait until everything is properly soaked, but honestly, I don't have the patience for that!" Leona said filling a syringe with cream liqueur.</p><br><p>Then, without question, she stuck the syringe into the cupcake.</p><br><br><br><p>The thick needle entered Glara's neck, causing her face to contort in wild pain. She knew it wouldn't be easy, but she hadn't expected the needle to be so sharp and thick.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, she plunged that needle into her neck on her own, it was her choice, the consequences of which she was going to face.</p><br><br><p>Bright blue liquid began to quickly escape from the steel casing, traveling down the needle and sinking into Glara's body.</p><br><p>With each passing second, the pain grew worse. Glara's eyes went wide, filling with blood, and her veins swelled as if they were ready to explode. Her body trembled, trying to deal with the crisis and get rid of the foreign fluid, but... it wasn't long before Code D came into action.</p><br><p>When the syringe was completely empty, Glara tossed it aside along with the black case and took a deep breath.</p><br><p>At the same time, Aiden grabbed Shiny by his tail, staring intently at Glara through the glass crystal that could reveal the Spark.</p><br><p>It was still too early, so all Aiden could see was the thick darkness, Glara's inner space, but... something confused him.</p><br><p>'Hmm? Is it just me or did the darkness just get thicker? So her inner space is reacting to the changes in her body? But... what could this be leading to?' Aiden pondered.</p><br><br><p>Glara swung her hand, deftly pulling out her plasma shotgun from her belt, staring intently at Redcore Wolf as her victim.</p><br><p>Redcore Wolf nodded deeply, realizing that now he could finally start fighting and get a chance at freedom.</p>
