            <br><p>Although it was an unpopular opinion, nobles, even the higher ones, also had problems. Their problems were different from those faced by ordinary people, though there were similarities too.</p><br><p>After all, money, status, and influence could make life better, but it could not make life free of troubles.</p><br><p>However, there was one thing that the nobles didn't worry about, unlike the people especially those who lived in not the best neighborhoods. It wasn't money, but something more important: security.</p><br><p>It didn't matter if it was a Light Noble or a Hallow Noble, main or side branch, heir or not, and what place in the family a noble held.</p><br><p>All of them had the highest safety, especially the representatives of the Twelve Branches.</p><br><p>The reputation of the family depended on it, as everyone knew that if one harmed the highest noble, the punishment would be a hundred times more severe.</p><br><p>Naturally, the higher the nobleman's position in the family, the higher his protection. Moreover, the nobles occupying high positions were mostly powerful Phantoms, they were capable of defending themselves.</p><br><p>But... no one in this world was invulnerable, or rather almost no one...</p><br><p>And, Zarot was clearly not in that special category.</p><br><p>'How did I get here? Fuck, it doesn't matter! I have to get out of here!' Zarot exclaimed inwardly.</p><br><p>The last thing he remembered was going to bed, it was an ordinary day, no different from a thousand others.</p><br><p>Then, he found himself here - in a dark, cold room, tied by thick purple chains to a chair.</p><br><p>These were no ordinary chains, as was clear from their color and shape: the links were elongated, tiny blades protruding inward like demon teeth.</p><br><p>The chains were not only strong enough that Zarot couldn't break them, but they also blocked his energy.</p><br><p>His physical strength and body toughness went nowhere, but... he wasn't mighty enough to break the chains and because of their special effect, he couldn't use his abilities.</p><br><p>Soon, fear ignited in Zarot's heart, and to his luck, he didn't have to wait too long. Just a few minutes after he opened his eyes, a loud creaking sound rang out.</p><br><p>The iron door slowly opened, letting in a beam of white light and a tall silhouette.</p><br><p>Soon, the silhouette stopped in front of him, with a loud click, several bright white lights on the ceiling lit up.</p><br><p>Zarot gasped, as his eyes opened wide in disbelief.</p><br><br><p>A growl full of anger escaped his throat, glaring at his captor with fury.</p><br><p>"This all happened because of you!"</p><br><p>Silhouette smirked, holding his hands behind his back like a skilled butler.</p><br><p>"Oh really, what exactly did I do to provoke your anger, Mr. Zarot Marzo?"</p><br><p>A slight, mocking smirk appeared on Gladius's face, his eyes narrowed like dangerous crescents.</p><br><p>"What do you want?!! No... Let me go right now! Do you even realize what you've done?"</p><br><p>There was no reply. Gladius was silent, he seemed eager to listen to whatever Zarot wanted to tell him.</p><br><p>"Bastard! You're the reason this fucking fight happened! You ask why I'm so angry? You were the one who protected Adam Vinter when Mariel attacked him! The Moon Colosseum, ninth wing, Kogen Noukx, and hundreds of nobles betting on The Rule of Power! All of this happened because of you!"</p><br><p>Gladius tilted his head, maintaining his silence, his eyes growing a little wider, watching Zarot's reaction, his emotions, and how fear was slowly consuming his heart.</p><br><p>"Hah... You think I'm afraid?"</p><br><p>Zarot grinned arrogantly, trying to appear bold and brave.</p><br><p>"You kidnapped a Light Noble from the Marzo Family! I hold not the least position in our hierarchy! Once my family finds out about this then even you will be in trouble!"</p><br><p>Gladius's lips parted slowly, it seemed he was about to say something, to dash Zarot's hopes of salvation, but someone else did it instead:</p><br><p>"I'm afraid you don't even realize the situation you're in."</p><br><p>Suddenly, a calm, almost emotionless female voice sounded behind Gladius. Something in that voice confused Zarot, but he didn't recognize what it was.</p><br><p>Soon, a woman with long purple hair and eyes as black as the abyss entered the room. Her body was covered by a long, exquisite dark coat, leaving only her hands, neck, and legs below the ankles exposed.</p><br><p>Enjoy new tales from My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Hesitation filled Zarot's eyes, and he blinked a few times trying to figure out who the woman was.</p><br><p>As soon as he saw the purple hair he thought it was someone from the Balo Family, but he soon gave up on that idea.</p><br><p>Her eyes... her posture and aura were calm, but also deeply frightening as if Zarot was facing his natural enemy.</p><br><p>Confusion consumed his mind, wanting answers to his questions.</p><br><p>With a slight movement, the woman threw off her coat, hanging it neatly on an unremarkable hanger.</p><br><p>Zarot's gaze traveled to her body, almost naked and perfect, but... there was no interest or lust in his eyes, only animal fear.</p><br><p>Purple scales, tiny and dense passed down the woman's sides, covering the underside of her breasts like armor.</p><br><p>The same scales were on her forearms and legs, purple tattoos filled with intricate symbols came out from her shoulders, flowing down her arms, collarbone, and back.</p><br><p>"Gladius, perhaps I should show my full form? That way we'll get to the desired result faster..." The woman asked her voice remaining calm.</p><br><p>"Nah, in that case, your aura might attract unwanted guests. It will disturb the whole atmosphere. We've already taken a risk because of you being in your half-form."</p><br><p>Gladius smiled weakly.</p><br><p>"All for your comfort."</p><br><p>"I see..." Again, only an emotionless reply followed from her.</p><br><p>All this time, Zarot said nothing, he couldn't believe what he was seeing and his mind refused to accept reality.</p><br><p>Noticing his blank stare, Gladius shook his head theatrically with a guilty expression.</p><br><p>"Oh, what an oversight on my part. You two don't know each other."</p><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Gladius stood in front of the woman and bowed low, introducing her as the auctioneer.</p><br><p>"This is my Operator - Xyrea. and..."</p><br><br><p>Taking a step back, Gladius slid his hands over her scales, his fingertips running over her soft skin.</p><br><p>"As you may already realize, she's a Crown Type monster."</p>
