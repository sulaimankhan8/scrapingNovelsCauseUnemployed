            <br><br><p>Adam opened his mouth wide, taking a big bite from a three-patty burger. Silvana had decided to give him this burger since she knew that the more meat, the more satisfied Adam would be.</p><br><p>However, there was another reason why she made that choice, she wanted to eat the burger with blue cheese and extra fried bacon. To her, it was the most desirable burger of the three.</p><br><p>"What do you think?" Silvana asked, looking at Adam who with a satisfied face was eating his burger.</p><br><p>Although the main feature of this burger was the three patties, it also had cheese and sauce, and the meat itself was juicy and fatty, so this burger was definitely not dry.</p><br><p>"Good, very good. Sure, this burger isn't as good as the lasagna I had today, but... it's still very decent." Adam nodded before taking another bite.</p><br><p>Silvana smiled before tasting her burger herself.</p><br><p>She ate much more carefully than Adam, trying not to get sloppy and taking small bites so she didn't eat it all too quickly.</p><br><p>"Where did you find this place? Did someone recommend it to you?" Adam asked glancing at Silvana before glancing at his already half-eaten burger.</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head.</p><br><p>"You'd know how much time I've spent on this. I just can't pick up and order food from a place I liked the looks of." Explore new worlds at empire</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion.</p><br><p>"Hmm? Then how do you do it?"</p><br><p>Silvana smiled bitterly before answering:</p><br><p>"Well, first, I spend a few hours deciding what I want to eat. Then, I'll select a few candidates and learn as much as I can about each one: menu, reviews, history, location, and so on."</p><br><br><p>"Only if I'm satisfied with everything do I place an order."</p><br><p>Adam stared at her for a while, clearly surprised by such diligence in a seemingly simple matter.</p><br><p>"Damn, I wouldn't have the patience for that. I'd just pick the first place that attracted me with its menu and advertising. All that matters is that it tastes good, don't you think?" Adam said before taking the next bite.</p><br><br><p>"Sure, I just can't do it any other way. I want to make sure I'm sure to get good and tasty food if I order. I'm not completely immune to a mistake, but at least I'm minimizing that chance."</p><br><p>Then, Silvana took another small bite from her burger.</p><br><p>"I rarely order takeout, it's not healthy and it's pretty expensive, so I don't want this rare opportunity to go nowhere."</p><br><p>Adam listened intently to Silvana. He realized that her words made sense. Though they were talking about food, Silvana's method of choice could be applied to other aspects of life as well.</p><br><p>It depended on the person, but if there was a really important event ahead, Silvana's method was the most effective.</p><br><p>However... Adam thought that Silvana was taking the choice of food delivery too seriously and he got an idea how to ease her mind.</p><br><br><p>Adam pulled out his phone and began to rapidly flick his finger across the screen as if he were looking for something.</p><br><p>"Hmm? What are you doing?" Silvana asked, she was slightly confused.</p><br><p>Adam shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Nothing serious, it's just that in an hour or so there'll be some couriers in front of our door."</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"What...? What do you mean?"</p><br><p>Silvana had a few guesses, but she just didn't believe that Adam did, until he showed her his phone.</p><br><p>The screen was full of orders from the most popular places serving burgers, so soon they would have the best burgers from this area of the Third Ring on their table.</p><br><p>Silvana gulped, realizing that it was already inevitable. Sure, orders could still be canceled, but Adam clearly wasn't going to do that.</p><br><p>'Well... It looks like tomorrow my lying down rest must come to an end. I urgently need to go to the gym, especially after dinners like this...' Silvana muttered internally.</p><br><p>At that, she wasn't upset or against Adam's actions, she just hadn't expected it as much as wanting to know if her choice was the right one or if there were better burgers somewhere?</p><br><p>Then, a bitter smile appeared on Silvana's face as she internally shook her head: 'I chose the burgers for us and he just ordered a few dozen, leaving me no choice but to try them all. Well, this is going to be interesting.'</p><br><p>Silvana bit down on her pinky finger with a slight smirk on her face.</p><br><br><br><p>Sano and Natta jumped off the platform, in a second finding themselves next to Glara, who was confused, not knowing what to do.</p><br><p>"You...? Wait... Are you going to fight too?" Glara gulped, examining their unusual armor.</p><br><p>Sano nodded, slamming her fists against each other, a cascade of sparks going outward.</p><br><p>"Yes, we'll do Shadow of the Woods, damn, too long a name, just Shadow. You keep fighting against the Redcore Wolf. You can still become a Phantom just like your brother." Sano said confidently before rushing forward.</p><br><p>Glara's gaze darkened. She realized the hidden meaning in her words since her brother was an Artificialborn Phantom, which meant it was now her maximum.</p><br><br><p>Natta's palm fell on her shoulder.</p><br><p>"There's no need to be upset. Being a Phantom is infinitely times better than being dead, isn't it?"</p><br><p>Glara's eyes went wide when she realized that Code D was still in effect and she had very little time left.</p><br><br><p>"Go ahead, you only have 80 seconds left. Sano and I will try to get our work done in 70 and help you at the end."</p><br><p>Then, without further ado, Natta rushed forward. She and Sano had already taken a few seconds to evaluate the situation and raise Glara's morale. They couldn't waste any more time.</p><br><p>The Shadow glared at Sano and Natta moving towards him.</p><br><p>The monster didn't feel a powerful aura from them like the Phantoms, but... he could see that they were much stronger than ordinary humans.</p><br><p>Soon, the Shadow realized that it was their equipment and exoskeletons that affected their genes, interacting with them as they were partially composed of them.</p><br><p>This meant that despite their skills and attempts, Natta and Sano couldn't become Phantoms if they killed a monster using Exoskeletons and False Nexuses.</p><br><p>Sure, if they killed the monster without their equipment, where only their genes and the monster were involved, then they would become Naturalborn Phantoms.</p><br><p>But... in that case, the outcome of their battle would be unknown. Neither their skills, nor their possible use of Code D, nor their experience, gave them a guarantee that in a 1 on 1 fight, they would kill the monster and become the Phantom.</p><br><p>After all, the Exoskeletons and False Nexuses gave experienced fighters too much of an advantage.</p><br><br><p>Sano jumped towards the Shadow, bringing her powerful fists down directly on his head, which was covered in branches with sharp spikes.</p><br><p>At the same time, Natta approached the monster from behind.</p><br><p>"Right... I mustn't waste any time..." Glara muttered glaring at the Redcore Wolf who had been staring at her the whole time.</p><br><p>The Shadow had come to his aid, but Glara also had allies that joined her. This put the Redcore Wolf in a difficult situation, but he wasn't going to give up, monsters didn't do that.</p>
