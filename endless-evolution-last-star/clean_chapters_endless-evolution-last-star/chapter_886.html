            <br><p>Reinz had every right to be arrogant, after all, even among the best, he was at the top. In his case, no matter how arrogant he was, it was almost the same as pride.</p><br><p>However, when Reinz said that he would finish the fight quickly and he wouldn't need his Nexus, he was serious.</p><br><p>Those were words he believed in with a full heart. Not only because he thought he was stronger than Adam, but because Reinz was sure that he possessed something that the Phantoms at the Twilight Palace had yet to grasp - the Stellar Resonance.</p><br><p>Every K3-Phantom had The Crystal Gates, as well as five lesser gates. However, the paths to opening the lesser gates could vary greatly, as well as the time required to do so.</p><br><p>The Phantoms at the Twilight Palace had reached K3-Level no more than two months ago, Reinz was no exception to this rule.</p><br><p>Although there were no restrictions, if a nobleman decided to stay at the Twilight Palace for more than two months, the administration would simply kick him out.</p><br><p>In a way, this equalized the odds between the Phantoms. Thus, Reinz knew that once he was able to open the first lesser gates, then there was no longer a worthy opponent for him at the Twilight Palace.</p><br><p>Sure, deep inside he hoped that one of the nobles could give him a decent fight. But he was just resting in preparation for his future journey. The final battle should have been a solid reason to leave the Twilight Palace, certainly with a quick victory.</p><br><p>But... What did Reinz see in front of him now?</p><br><p>A bright star like the one in his right eye was aimed at him, showing him in the reflection.</p><br><p>Before Reinz could realize anything, he felt a muffled pain in his stomach. His eyes traveled lower, seeing Adam's fist, forearms covered in inflated veins.</p><br><p>The impact threw Reinz aside, but Adam didn't need to continue the series of attacks as Reinz easily regained his balance slipping a few meters away.</p><br><p>With a sweep of his arm, Reinz straightened up, glaring intently at Adam.</p><br><p>"Well, well... This is unexpected... the Stellar Resonance? When did that happen? You've been at the Twilight Palace for less than a week."</p><br><p>Adam smiled weakly, "You can count it as yesterday. That's a pretty cool ability, isn't it?"</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Reinz didn't bother to answer. He had no desire to talk to Adam - he had come here to fight.</p><br><p>Electric shocks ran through Reinz's right hand turning into a short spear.</p><br><p>Reinz threw the spear at Adam, but he just jerked his head to the side letting the spear disappear into the barrier.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Reinz created another spear, but something stopped him from throwing it.</p><br><p>"Hah, lightning again...?" Adam smiled bitterly, "You can throw a few hundred at me. I doubt a single spear will hit me.</p><br><p>"My past opponent was capable of much more fearsome techniques. You won't be able to defeat me with something so simple."</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Reinz simply nodded.</p><br><p>His fingers twitched as the lightning spear fluttered into particles.</p><br><p>Then, Reinz changed his fighting stance as his eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>Long gauntlets with sharp claws covered his hands from the forearm, and knee-high boots made of dense electricity completed his battle form.</p><br><p>"I see... Then I won't try to use any more tricks against you." Reinz affirmed, "You seem to be someone who is only suited for straight combat. I accept those terms."</p><br><p>Reinz leaned in as his frame shook. In a flash, he appeared in front of Adam as he swung his arms like a wild beast with his claws.</p><br><p>The silver needle repelled the attack, but Reinz wasn't about to stop.</p><br><p>With each swing, he grew faster, unleashing a hail of blows on Adam who defended himself with one hand.</p><br><p>Although Reinz's main weapon at the moment was his claws, his fighting style was not aggressive. He acted calculatingly, trying to find a weak spot in Adam's defense and gradually push him back into the barrier.</p><br><p>But, Adam understood that as well.</p><br><br><p>Upon another parry, Adam's rings shuddered with a flash of crimson light. Without a moment's hesitation, he released the needle and gripped Reinz's wrist tightly, sharp claws stopping close to his face.</p><br><p>"You're fast, but Reinz..." Adam wheezed, his eyes getting narrower, "Do you think that will be enough?"</p><br><p>Adam lifted one foot off the ground before starting to spin quickly around, continuing to hold Reinz tightly.</p><br><p>Reinz did not attempt to free himself. It was to his disadvantage. Sure, Adam grabbed his wrists, but Adam's hands were busy as well.</p><br><p>'He thinks he's winning.' Reinz muttered internally, 'But, soon he'll just let me go, I'll regain my balance, and our fight will continue.'</p><br><br><p>As Adam's grip loosened, Reinz followed the momentum and flew off to the side. Soon, his feet touched the barrier, working as an invisible wall for him to push off of.</p><br><p>Suddenly, a white light fell on Reinz's face. He raised his head, seeing a blob of energy rushing straight at him.</p><br><p>In a hurry, Reinz jumped aside, the electrical discharges staying in his path.</p><br><p>Then, the blob slammed into the wall in a fiery explosion. It was none of Adam's abilities, just a use of the Global Gene.</p><br><p>'Hmm...' Reinz mused, 'If that blob had hit me, I would have been in trouble. His energy has a very high density, just like mine.'</p><br><br><p>Reinz took a step back, in the electric shift he found himself behind, staring intently at Adam.</p><br><p>In the first minute of the fight, no one could make any progress.</p><br><p>However, that was not the case for the spectators. They realized that Adam and Reinz were at least equals.</p><br><p>For the youths, this was good news - they were expected a spectacular fight, but not for the elder nobles.</p><br><p>After all, the difference in the money at stake was 1.5x, and territories were valued much more... So, many of the older nobles were nervous, because they realized that Reinz's defeat was possible.</p><br><p>Well, some were definitely pleased.</p><br><p>"Hah..." Erik muttered, shaking his glass of whiskey, "They own billions, but they don't know how to bet. What a bunch of fools."</p>
