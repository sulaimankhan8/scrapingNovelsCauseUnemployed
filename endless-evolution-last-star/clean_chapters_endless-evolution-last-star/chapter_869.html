            <br><p>Suddenly, the whispers wandering among the crowd stopped. All of the nobles directed their gazes at the green-haired girl who appeared before Adam and Silvana.</p><br><p>If the girl was a stranger to Adam, the other nobles knew well who she was.</p><br><p>Well, she wasted no time and trying to follow etiquette, introduced herself to Adam.</p><br><p>"I am not a child! I'm as grown up as everyone here!"</p><br><p>She exclaimed, pointing at Adam with a menacing look. Then, she took a deep breath and put her palm to her chest.</p><br><p>"My name is Kenna Xeron, I am a proud member of one of the twelve great families. You, a commoner, should have realized this immediately by the color of my hair and eyes handed down to me by my family's powerful genes!"</p><br><p>Adam received a thoughtful expression.</p><br><p>'Hmm? The Xeron Family? Come to think of it... So far, I have not met any representatives of only three great families. I don't know about the other two, but one family has to be the first among the twelve.'</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Kenna noticed Adam's hazy gaze.</p><br><p>"Hey, are you even listening to me, you bastard!"</p><br><p>As soon as her words were uttered, a lone cold glint ran across Adam's eyes before quickly disappearing.</p><br><p>"Hey..." he grunted, "Either say what you want or leave. I'm not in the mood to listen to your yelling and insults. It's annoying."</p><br><p>Kenna pointed at Giselle, a few silhouettes were visible in the distance - the hotel staff was already rushing to her aid. Like observers they were watching every fight closely, to respond in time to even the most gruesome wounds.</p><br><br><p>She gritted her teeth, the muscles in her face twitching.</p><br><p>"Is it hard for you to fight honorably? You tore her apart like a wild, foul beast!"</p><br><p>With a short pause, Adam uttered.</p><br><p>"Fine, I'll answer you."</p><br><p>He lifted his chin, seeming to purposely look Kenna up and down.</p><br><p>"It was her request. She didn't want me to give up, so I had to promise her something in exchange for the fight."</p><br><br><p>Kenna blinked wide-eyed.</p><br><p>"Tell me more about that!"</p><br><br><p>With a sharp reply, Adam turned around, getting ready to move on. Kenna stayed behind, confused. She wasn't prepared for this turn of events, she didn't know how to get Adam to talk.</p><br><p>But... Suddenly someone came to her rescue.</p><br><p>A sly, familiar voice sounded from the side.</p><br><p>"Well, it's simple Ms. Kenna," observer no. 3, theatrically waved his hand, "The whole point is that Mr. Adam swore on his Operator's life that he would fight seriously."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Immediately, a powerful aura like a wild flame burst out of Adam. Slowly, he turned, piercing the seemingly unconcerned man with his gaze.</p><br><p>"You... How...? No, it's not that. You should not have said that. You weren't supposed to know about it."</p><br><p>Adam's cold voice sent shivers down Kenna's back, yet the expression on the man's face didn't change.</p><br><p>As with Giselle, he specifically mentioned details that neither he nor the general public should know.</p><br><br><p>Well, it was part of his job, to some extent.</p><br><p>While Adam was deciding whether he should act somehow, a storm of emotions came over Kenna. Every few seconds, her expression changed, her lips quivering.</p><br><p>Then, she turned around abruptly, piercing Silvana with her gaze.</p><br><p>It wasn't just a casual look, Silvana flinched with anger sent in her direction. Naturally, Adam could not miss it.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter, I thought you had a conflict with Giselle."</p><br><p>Kenna hissed, her aura growing stronger outside of her awareness.</p><br><p>"But... All this for a promise to your Operator? This is insane! Do you think that's a worthy reason to fight seriously against a high noble? By doing so, you have only humiliated yourself and her!"</p><br><p>Adam remained silent for a long time. Narrowing his eyes, his powerful voice echoed along the great passages.</p><br><p>"Kenna... You are as much a Phantom as I am. Despite having reached a K3-Level, don't you realize how important Operators are?"</p><br><p>In response, Kenna swung her hand dramatically, a horrible grimace on her face.</p><br><p>"Shut up! That's not what this is about! Operators are important, every Phantom knows that! However, your Operator is a commoner just like you!"</p><br><p>Silvana gasped, not because Kenna had insulted her, but because she thought Adam would be angry. She extended her hand going to stop him, but...</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Adam didn't move.</p><br><p>Moreover, soon everyone heard his calm voice:</p><br><p>"Yes, Silvana is a commoner just like me." Adam slowly waved his hand, "However, could there be any problem with that? What does it have to do with my promise to Giselle?"</p><br><p>Gritting her teeth, Kenna exclaimed menacingly:</p><br><p>"Direct! You proved you were strong enough, you had the right to be her opponent. But! By making such a pledge, you equated Giselle's life, the life of a high noblewoman with the life of a commoner!"</p><br><p>Without stopping, feeling genuine anger and resentment over the whole situation, Kenna stepped forward firmly as she waved her hand.</p><br><p>"Adam Vinter, you can't be so stupid as to not realize that her life," she pointed at Silvana, "Is worthless compared to the life of a supreme-"</p><br><br><p>Adam's fist smashed into her face.</p><br><p>A loud crunch from her immediately broken nose echoed through Twilight Palace, establishing complete silence.</p><br><p>Two trickles of blood rushed in front of Kenna's wide-open eyes, a disbelief similar to Giselle's reflected on her face.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, her back leaned against the ground as a menacing shadow fell over her.</p><br><p>Before Kenna could regain her senses, Adam made a second hit.</p><br><p>At full power, his fist plunged into her stomach.</p><br><p>A stream of blood rushed from Kenna's mouth, flooding everything in front of her.</p><br><p>Realizing that things were serious, Kenna jerked her right arm about to stop Adam, but he immediately pinned her wrist to the ground with his foot, preventing her from moving.</p><br><p>Then, their gazes met.</p><br><p>Adam's cold eyes, two cruel abysses knowing no mercy seemed to pierce her soul with their gaze.</p><br><p>"Who...?" he whispered, "Who decides whose life is worth something and whose isn't?"</p><br><p>White streams of energy covered Adam's fist, filling his hand with the great power of the K3-Phantom.</p><br><p>"Right now, your life is worth no more than an insect to me. So..."</p><br><p>Adam brought his fist up to his chest, building up the power in a single point.</p><br><p>"Should I just crush you?"</p>
