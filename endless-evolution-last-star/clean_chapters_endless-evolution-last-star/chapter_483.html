            <br><p>After fifty minutes of unsuccessful attempts, Adam's patience finally came to an end. In his place, sooner or later, everyone would have come to this state.</p><br><p>But... there was one significant difference between him and the other Phantoms: his Evolution Tree had not responded to any of his tries.</p><br><p>Most Phantoms would not have this difficulty. Their Evolution Tree would show them the Two Walls after ten or twenty minutes. Hardly any of them would need to get angry or come to rage.</p><br><p>It was a rare situation, neither Silvana, nor Riska, nor even Dahla or her Operator, knew why Adam needed so much time, but there was nothing they could do but keep waiting.</p><br><p>They didn't want to alarm Adam, since it was not a good idea to do so while the Phantom was trying to reveal his Two Walls.</p><br><p>But, their anxiety grew stronger with every passing second. What frightened people the most was the unknown, they didn't know what to expect or how long they had to wait.</p><br><p>Could it be another ten seconds, or could it last for hours? Who knows?</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped confidently amidst the void, heading straight for his Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>For some reason, when Adam decided to move into action, he sensed that the Two Walls were inside the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>He supposed this before, as there was only darkness and emptiness all around. The Two Walls simply had nowhere to hide except inside the massive Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>"Come on. I'm asking you one last time, show me the Two Walls!" Adam said confidently, clenching his fists tightly.</p><br><p>His words seemed to make no sense, but Adam knew that the Evolution Tree could not only hear him but respond.</p><br><p>It didn't happen often, only when it was needed.</p><br><p>Adam was sure that this was the right situation, so he decided to wait another ten seconds, but as before, there was no response.</p><br><p>Then, Adam shrugged nonchalantly and took a step forward.</p><br><p>"Fine, I don't know why you don't want to show me the way to get stronger, but I can figure it out on my own. At least now I know where the Two Walls are."</p><br><p>Without further ado, Adam brought his fist down on the snow-white bark of the Evolution Tree, sending shivers throughout the majestic tree.</p><br><br><br><p>The Evolution Tree didn't respond in any way.</p><br><p>Adam didn't hit with full force, but he thought it would be enough to get some kind of reaction.</p><br><p>There were no scratches or blood on the white bark or Adam's fists.</p><br><p>But... though things remained the same on the inside, there were some changes on the outside.</p><br><p>Silvana and Riska didn't notice anything, but Dahla flinched slightly. She felt a slight, almost imperceptible energy vibration emanating from Adam. It happened at the moment he hit the tree.</p><br><p>Beth's green eyes flashed, and she saw it too.</p><br><p>Then, she glanced at the corner of the screen, checking the time.</p><br><p>'Hmm... first burst of energy fifty-five minutes later. Well, the time isn't that interesting. What's important is that his Evolution Tree ignored him all this time, and he had to move to more drastic and active actions.' Beth pondered before popping the cheese chips into her mouth, crunching them loudly.</p><br><p>Unlike the others, Beth understood what was going on inside Adam's inner space right now. She knew that he was starting to smash his Evolution Tree to get to the Two Walls.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Beth set the timer, and the first second soon passed.</p><br><p>"Well. I'm sure in almost an hour he used every idea he had to beg it from Evolution Tree, but it didn't budge. That's already good, now let's see how long it can resist. Although... it's already a success."</p><br><br><br><p>Adam continued hitting his Evolution Tree. He hit the point that was between his Initial Gene and The Lock which was at the very bottom of the Evolution Tree, just above the root level.</p><br><p>Gradually, it had an effect.</p><br><br><p>A piece of bark cracked and flew aside in the next high-speed impact.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Adam's expression contorted with a rapid but vivid pain. It was only for a split second, but he felt as if a sharp needle had plunged into his heart.</p><br><p>"I see... This is a part of me after all. I use my powers to destroy my powers... Sounds confusing and weird, but it's not like I have any other choice, right?" Adam muttered, glancing at the flying-off piece of bark.</p><br><p>It lay in the midst of the void, being solid and whole. It wasn't going to disappear or collapse completely since its home was Adam's inner space.</p><br><p>"What's more. I hadn't thought about it before, but I'm really curious to know what's inside."</p><br><p>Adam muttered, looking at the bright white light coming from the crack. Experience more tales on empire</p><br><p>Ordinary trees had a trunk behind the bark and nothing else, but the Evolution Tree was no ordinary tree.</p><br><p>And, Adam realized that the Two Walls were there, inside, behind the bark and the thin layer of the trunk.</p><br><p>"You're still not talking, right? Well, let's get on with it then. I don't like this and maybe you have your reasons, but I can't delay. I made a promise and if I don't reach the local limit, I will certainly lose in The Rule of Power."</p><br><p>With those words, Adam gritted his teeth and struck the next blow directly into the crack where the light was coming from.</p><br><p>The ghostly needle once again pierced his heart with a bright pain.</p><br><p>After all, by attacking the Evolution Tree, he was attacking himself at the same time.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Chunks of bark flew off to the side causing more and more energy vibrations to emanate from Adam's body.</p><br><p>Soon it got to the point where Silvana and Riska felt it.</p><br><p>Then... something began to happen that made their eyes go wide, staring at Adam in disbelief.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Energy began to drain from his body, but not because he was ready to fight. It looked like he was losing his energy and in some ways, it was similar to what Katrin was going through when she removed her Initial Gene.</p><br><p>"What... What's happening?!" Silvana exclaimed in mild panic.</p><br><br><p>"I don't know. This shouldn't be happening." Dahla looked at the time, her eyes running from her NEP to Adam.</p><br><p>Soon, she sighed heavily, she made a decision she didn't like.</p><br><p>Riska cast a glance at her, she understood what Dahla was thinking, and she agreed with her.</p><br><p>Dahla stood up, staring at Adam intently.</p><br><p>"Let's wake him up. I don't know what's going on, but he shouldn't lose his energy over wanting to see the Two Walls. Something has definitely gone wrong inside. Damn, we should have figured that out when he failed in thirty minutes."</p><br><br><p>Dahla stepped forward, about to bring Adam back to the real world.</p><br><p>"Stay where you are."</p><br><p>Suddenly, a woman's voice echoed throughout the training hall, a voice that was familiar to each of them.</p><br><p>Dahla's eyes went wide as she abruptly turned around, looking into the corners of the room.</p><br><p>"Beth...? Is that you?"</p>
