            <br><p>"Hurry up, we have to figure out where the Prime Thunder Demon is going!" Oskar exclaimed as he climbed out of the Igno Ants Nest with the others.</p><br><p>He listened intently to his Operator, as did the others, before turning to the west - towards the massive volcano. Oddly enough, it was the volcano that Adam and Katrin had originally moved towards, Essence Scarlet Pyromancer had to be located there.</p><br><p>"Hm? Why is Thunder Demon carrying a larva king to the volcano? What the hell is going on here and where did Prime Thunder Demon even come from?" Katrin frowned, gritting her teeth. She didn't like what was happening at all.</p><br><p>'First, the ants, then Golden Light Squad, and now Prime Thunder Demon, who shouldn't even be here since he's not a fire monster!' Katrin exclaimed internally, not understanding why she was having such bad luck.</p><br><p>Well... the first two points were just coincidences related to each other because, without the threat of Igno King's birth, there would be no Golden Light Squad here.</p><br><p>But... Prime Thunder Demon decided to appear here for several different reasons, one of which was Adam and his nature. However, that was only one of many reasons.</p><br><p>"Hmm... Thunder Demons are rather clever and cunning monsters..." Osana muttered, tapping her foot thoughtfully on the ground with a deep gaze.</p><br><p>"Surely it realizes that Adam won't stop until it catches up with him. Moreover, Thunder Demon must be aware that Adam is stronger and in their fight, he will lose."</p><br><p>Then, Osana's eyes went wide when she revealed the monster's simple yet effective plan.</p><br><br><br><p>Adam's foot swept down on Thunder Demon's head from the right at tremendous speed, leaving an electric trail behind it.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon smirked and raised his right paw to block the attack.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Waves of shivers ran through Thunder Demon's body as the impact threw the monster a few meters away.</p><br><p>Adam wanted to continue his attack, but... Thunder Demon easily regained his balance and confidently landed on the ground. He did so holding the larva king with one paw, which was large and heavy.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon looked at his paw, at the cracked scales from Adam's kick, and licked his teeth.</p><br><p>He knew that Black Cinder Forest was not his home, it was an inhospitable place where a lightning monster like him had no room in the flame lands.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon was ready for the challenge, for his cunning plan did not involve fighting anyone, he had to steal the larva king, which he had already done. All that remained was to get to the volcano.</p><br><br><p>Thunder Demon's eyes flashed as dense electricity more like glowing plasma emerged from beneath his scales.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes. He didn't understand what Thunder Demon was doing, because during their long fight, Essence One had never used such an ability.</p><br><p>Then, Thunder Demon's black scales began to turn red from the intense heat. They were like a piece of metal just pulled out of a furnace by a blacksmith, glowing and red-hot.</p><br><p>The light streams of steam coming from Thunder Demon soon became much larger and more active, and the ash beneath his feet began shining with scarlet sparks like gunpowder ready to ignite.</p><br><p>'Adam, only Prime Thunder Demons have this ability. He heats his body with electricity, thus increasing his physical abilities to a new level.' Silvana said seriously with a sharp look.</p><br><p>She realized that although Adam had previously defeated a stronger Thunder Demon, they couldn't underestimate a Prime Thunder Demon whose strength level was almost the same.</p><br><p>Adam nodded as he narrowed his eyes preparing for the fight. He clutched his needle tightly, looking for weaknesses in Thunder Demon's body.</p><br><p>But... Thunder Demon didn't share Adam's and Silvana's thoughts at all.</p><br><p>Whoooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon smirked and without hesitation rushed towards the volcano, not intending to fight Adam and put his life in danger.</p><br><p>After the reinforcement, Thunder Demon became much faster, leaving behind him streams of steam and a trail of red-hot ash on the ground.</p><br><p>Adam blinked several times in confusion, baffled by Thunder Demon's actions. Any monster in his place would have immediately rushed into battle against Adam, rather than run away....</p><br><p>"Shit. They're really cunning and clever and have their own goals. Essence One came to Salt Village to fight and did so until the end, but this Thunder Demon has a completely different goal." Adam growled gritting his teeth before rushing after Thunder Demon. Experience tales at m v|l e'-NovelBin.net</p><br><br><p>Meanwhile, Katrin, Oskar, and the others were gradually approaching the western volcano.</p><br><p>They took a shortcut, so they needed a few more minutes to reach their target.</p><br><p>From time to time, Adam managed to catch up with Thunder Demon even though he was reinforced and attacked, trying to knock Thunder Demon off balance.</p><br><p>Because of this, Thunder Demon had to change his direction to dodge the hits, so his path to the western volcano was long.</p><br><br><p>Adam threw his needle straight at Thunder Demon, about to pierce the monster's shoulder, but Thunder Demon just grabbed the silver needle and pulled Adam towards him.</p><br><p>'Alright! He finally decided to fight!' Adam inwardly exclaimed, quickly approaching Thunder Demon.</p><br><br><br><p>Thunder Demon slapped his tail on the ground raising waves of ash around him thus throwing Adam off.</p><br><p>Adam gritted his teeth and swung his needle a few times cutting the ash cloth apart, but Thunder Demon was no longer there. The monster had reached the foot of the western volcano, hurrying towards its summit with a crazed glint in its eye.</p><br><p>"What the hell...? What's he doing?"</p><br><p>'Adam!' Silvana exclaimed, 'You have to stop him or kill him before he falls into the volcano.'</p><br><p>"Agh? Why? Won't he just burn up in the lava?" Adam was confused but continued to pursue Thunder Demon quickly running after the monsters.</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip.</p><br><p>'Considering the strength of his body, that's not enough. Moreover, the larva king won't burn either since it has good protection against fire, which is logical considering where it was born.'</p><br><p>Silvana took a deep breath.</p><br><p>'Anyway, Thunder Demon's plan is simple but dangerous. He wants to use the lava as cover from you and the others. Then, he'll eat the larva king saturated with energy from the crystals and quickly absorb it all!'</p><br><p>"And...?" Adam gulped, realizing what Silvana was getting at.</p><br><p>'Given its power and all the circumstances, there's a very good chance that it will evolve and go beyond the Purple Threat Level.' Silvana said in a low voice.</p><br><p>'Adam, this is far more dangerous than the Igno Ant King. You must do everything but kill him before he eats the larva king!' Silvana exclaimed confidently.</p><br><p>Adam slowly nodded with a deep look before stopping and heading towards Katrin, and the Golden Light Squad.</p><br><p>In that time they had already reached the volcano and were gradually climbing towards the core. They had one goal and they had to work together to prevent the coming disaster.</p><br><br><p>Adam appeared in front of them causing small rocks to fly off to the sides as he glanced at Oskar and Katrin.</p><br><p>"Hey, we need to kill Thunder Demon and we don't have a hell of a lot of time to do it. You've already come up with a plan, right?" Adam asked with a slight hope in his voice.</p><br><p>In response, all he got was Katrin's confident smirk.</p>
