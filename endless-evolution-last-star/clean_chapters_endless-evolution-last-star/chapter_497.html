            <br><p>"So, are we going to fight right here? Won't that be dangerous for Silvana and Riska?" Adam asked, looking around.</p><br><p>Tron smirked as he headed towards the middle of the wall.</p><br><p>"Don't worry. This place was made to be useful as well as sturdy. But, I know what you're talking about. Random attacks could land in the spectator room and for Silvana or Riska, it could end badly."</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a serious look. He wanted to start fighting, but Silvana's safety was above all else.</p><br><p>"Well, we have a solution for that." Tron said before waving his hand towards the spectator room, "Hey, Dahla, it's time to do this! I need your help!"</p><br><p>As soon as Dahla heard Tron's voice she abruptly turned around, coughed, and made a serious, calm expression on her face.</p><br><p>"I'm sorry girls, but it's time to get busy working so you don't get hurt."</p><br><p>Riska rested her cheek on her hand, a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>"Sure, go ahead, strong Phantom, protect us, weak Operators."</p><br><p>"Pffft shut up." Dahla snorted as she stepped forward.</p><br><p>She did the same as Tron, approaching the middle of the opposite wall.</p><br><p>Exchanging glances, they nodded and placed their palms against the wall before their eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>Adam watched their actions curiously, he didn't know what they were doing or how it was supposed to protect Silvana and Riska.</p><br><p>After all, a battle between K2 and K3 Phantoms could bring serious destruction. If Adam used all his abilities, he could eventually destroy an entire hill or at least damage it badly.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Suddenly, the stone slabs that covered the entire training hall shuddered, cracks quickly spreading across their surface like spider webs.</p><br><p>Adam looked up, for neither the floor nor the ceiling was an exception, the cracks covered the entire training hall, but that was only the beginning.</p><br><p>A bright golden light came out of the cracks as if before an explosion.</p><br><p>The light became denser and denser until it reached a state of energy. The energy soaked into the cracks before showing itself again, in the form of an amber liquid, like resin.</p><br><p>"Oh, how interesting..." Adam muttered, watching as the resin covered all the stone slabs in a thick, even layer.</p><br><p>After only five minutes, Tron and Dahla stopped channeling energy into the stone slabs and took a step back, removing their palms from the walls.</p><br><p>Tron looked around and smiled contentedly.</p><br><p>"Good, by utilizing our energy, the slabs managed to create an impenetrable barrier."</p><br><p>'Barrier...?' Adam internally muttered before turning towards the spectator room.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the resin covered the passage, creating a dense, solid layer that was able to protect Silvana and Riska from any accidental attacks.</p><br><br><p>Adam approached the wall, touching the amber resin. It was smooth, perfectly reflecting his figure like a mirror as if a master sculptor carved it out of some solid crystal.</p><br><br><p>Tron approached him, placing a hand on his shoulder.</p><br><p>Adam turned around and asked in a low voice:</p><br><p>"What is it? Is that Dahla's ability?"</p><br><p>Tron shook his head.</p><br><p>"Nah, it's all about those slabs. They, like the weights you lifted in the early days, are made of monster material, well, not the same, but you get the idea."</p><br><p>Adam nodded, wanting to know more about it. He had never seen anything like this before.</p><br><br><p>"They are made from a monster who has a unique ability, it can use enemy energy to crack its armor and cover itself with an extremely durable layer of amber resin."</p><br><p>Adam's fingertips went over the resin.</p><br><br><br><p>"So much so that Dahla needs to use her most powerful attack to create a hole the size of a door or something. Sure, a Phantom like Damien would break through them without difficulty, but for you and me, that's an impossible task."</p><br><p>Adam nodded, then he turned to Dahla, who was standing against the wall, her arms crossed over her chest.</p><br><p>"Wait... Doesn't that mean Dahla can't get out of here now? And... Riska and Silvana won't be able to come here..."</p><br><p>Tron shook his head.</p><br><p>Dahla nodded and headed straight for the spectator room.</p><br><p>"Good luck Adam, I hope I don't have to come back here too often to heal you. Tron won't hold back, that's for sure." Dahla said calmly, her voice low and measured.</p><br><p>She stood in front of the amber resin and simply stepped forward, effortlessly passing through it like jelly. Then, she sat down next to Silvana and Riska, waiting for the first battle to begin.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide when he saw this.</p><br><p>"What the hell... She just went through it."</p><br><p>Tron smirked as he turned around and headed to the other side of the room to get into his stance.</p><br><p>"That's the whole point. Silvana and Riska can get through that resin just as easily as Dahla, but only if they don't use energy. So our attacks won't be able to hurt them in any way, since the resin will block everything."</p><br><p>Then, Tron walked to the wall and easily lifted the stone slab, the resin not preventing him from doing so.</p><br><p>Behind the wall were two black cases, Adam's and Tron's Nexuses.</p><br><p>Tron smirked and picked up one case, tossing it sharply in Adam's direction.</p><br><br><p>With a quick motion of his hand, Tron closed the stone slab like a chest.</p><br><p>"What...? You're not going to use your Nexus?" Adam asked, hurriedly catching the case with his Nexus.</p><br><p>Tron smirked as he stepped forward.</p><br><p>"Not yet. Whether or not I have to use my Nexus depends solely on your success. Don't forget, you can't defeat me, but... you can definitely hurt me. A Phantom like you is capable of that, even considering you're a W0."</p><br><br><p>'Damn... On one hand, he praised me, but on the other... he's not wrong. I really don't stand a chance and if I were to be opposed by a K1-Phantom, I wouldn't take this fight seriously either.'</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, gathering his thoughts before opening his case, looking at his gauntlets waiting to rush into battle.</p><br><p>'Fine, now is not the time to win. It will come in forty days. The Rule of Power... I will lose now to win there.'</p><br><p>Adam put on his gauntlets, while Tron watched him intently.</p><br><p>'Oh, what a confident gaze. Good, he's figured out why he's here. Maybe he'll even see my Nexus.'</p>
