            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1327: Anger of Two Women</strong></p><br><p>Adam and Silvana had difficult moments on their journey, which was not as long as that of other pairs, but very intense.</p><br><p>However, the number of times Silvana was truly angry with Adam was small, and it always had to do with their work, that is, it was related to the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>It is unknown whether this case will be an exception, but for Narica, everything was clear from the very first second.</p><br><p>Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze.</p><br><p>Adam’s hand squeezed Narica’s breast without a hint of shame, with only one goal in mind: to make her so angry that she would forget Norax’s order.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam didn’t know Narica very well, except that she had a strong character and a cold temper, which is why he decided to do something so risky instead of trying to provoke her with taunts.</p><br><p>Adam was sure that a person like Narica would never be able to ignore such insolence.</p><br><br><p>While Silvana’s lips trembled and Norax’s eyes widened, Narica’s face turned red as a tomato from a wave of shame and embarrassment she hadn’t felt in decades.</p><br><br><p>She faltered, her voice trembling. Her gaze fell to Adam’s hand, which was still on the soft, lush place he should not have touched, not even in his dreams or nightmares.</p><br><br><p>Narica screamed with such force that a shockwave rippled across the ground, and Adam’s hair flew back in the gust of wind.</p><br><p>Before he could say anything, she vanished, reappearing to his right. Her foot slammed into his face, knocking out his jaw and distorting his expression.</p><br><br><p>The impact threw Adam back with such force that he bounced off the ground several times like a pebble off the surface of a lake.</p><br><p>He opened his eyes while in midair as Narica’s shadow fell over him, her hands clasped together, actively trembling with dark energy.</p><br><p>Her shame was as strong as her rage.</p><br><p>‘How dare he?!’ She screamed internally as she brought the blow down on Adam, driving him into the ground. “How dare he do this now, in front of Mr. Norax?!”</p><br><p>Under the flying debris, Adam reached forward, summoning the Dual Demon Sword. Now, he had enough energy to do so, but before he could make a single swing, Narica threw him aside and launched a house-sized lump of darkness at him.</p><br><p>‘FUCK!’ Adam’s eyes widened as he swung his sword, but it was too late.</p><br><p>The darkness engulfed him in a vicious blast, like hundreds of jaws tearing him apart in wild pain. Countless wounds instantly covered Adam’s body as he collapsed to the ground, bleeding profusely.</p><br><p>“Agh… Agh… Agh…” Narica was breathing heavily, it seemed like a little more and flames would come out of her mouth, nose, and ears.</p><br><p>Then, realization struck her—she had gone too far, she had used too much power against K4-Phantom when she should have just sparred.</p><br><p>“S-Shit!” She exclaimed, about to rush forward, but something stopped her at the last moment.</p><br><p>Particles of light gathered around Adam, who seemed not to be breathing, as Silvana’s spectral form appeared next to him.</p><br><p>Her expression was complicated, no one could understand what she was thinking at that moment.</p><br><p>When her emotions should have turned to anger, her eyes widened, and a smile unconsciously spread across her face.</p><br><p>Twitch. Twitch. Twitch.</p><br><p>Adam’s fingertips twitched as his aura burst out with new strength. White flames billowed from his body, growing with each passing moment.</p><br><p>Soon, he was able to rise from the ground while streams of blood flowed from the wounds on his body, especially from his nose.</p><br><p>“Damn!” He exclaimed, combing his hair back. “It actually worked! Who would have known it would be so effective!”</p><br><p>At that time, his eyes were not looking at Narica, Silvana, or the clouds, but at the Energy Axis in his inner space. One thread after another intertwined with each other, approaching the main line.</p><br><p>For Adam to stay alive, the Evolution Tree had to release energy arrays that were sufficient to recreate an effect similar to the first day.</p><br><p>Adam couldn’t know the exact number, but looking at the Energy Axis from the side, he could say that about 35% had been rebuilt, which was evident from his active aura.</p><br><p>Soon, the joy passed, and it was time to face the consequences of his actions as Adam turned to meet Silvana’s stern gaze.</p><br><p>“You…” She hissed. “You should thank the gods that it worked and you didn’t die, otherwise, I would have killed you myself. Don’t you dare ever do that again, do you understand me?!”</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head with an awkward smile.</p><br><p>“Hey, you promised you wouldn’t get mad!”</p><br><p>“Yes, but I didn’t know you were going to grope other women in front of me! What were you thinking?”</p><br><br><p>While they were arguing, Narica approached them, her gaze cold.</p><br><p>“Adam…” She said slowly. “If you dare do something like that again, I’ll kill you. I mean it, and…”</p><br><p>She couldn’t finish as Norax appeared behind her, who knew how to handle such situations.</p><br><br><p>His hand landed on Narica’s butt, causing her to jump in shock.</p><br><p>She covered her butt and turned around, realizing with a delay what had just happened.</p><br><p>“Sir! What… What are you doing…?” She whispered as her face quickly turned red, not from anger, but from embarrassment.</p><br><p>“Hahaha! Nothing, just testing the reaction of my favorite maid. Can’t I do that on my own property?”</p><br><p>A blush covered Narica’s cheeks as she turned away, muttering something to herself.</p><br><br><p>Norax took a sip of his coffee and turned the cup over to show that it was empty.</p><br><p>“Narica, my coffee is finished. Will you make me another one?”</p><br><p>“S-Sure! Of course, sir!” She jumped up and snatched the cup from his hands, skipping off to the kitchen.</p><br><p>Norax watched her go before turning to Adam.</p><br><p>“Hey, it worked, but seriously — don’t do that again.” He waved his hand. “She could have actually killed you. Next time, one slap on the butt won’t stop her.”</p><br><br><p>“But it worked, right?”</p><br><p>“Yeah, I guess so.” Norax waved his hands.</p><br><p>Silvana, who was standing to the side, rolled her eyes.</p><br><p>‘Just idiots, each of them, I have no words.’</p>
