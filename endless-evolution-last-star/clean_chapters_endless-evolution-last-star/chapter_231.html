            <br><p>"Magnus Zephyr... If he can help me, does he have some unique equipment better than here?" Adam muttered thoughtfully, rubbing his chin.</p><br><p>Lirla sighed heavily.</p><br><p>"Don't worry, he has great equipment, but it's more than that. He's powerful, cunning, and clever, in fact like most scientists working for themselves. I mean, it's not easy being an ordinary person to become so influential that the government and military won't control you but let you immerse yourself in experiments, regardless of their goals, only occasionally sending requests."</p><br><p>Hearing Lirla's last words, Adam's eyes grew darker, for that description was perfect for Aiden Henk: a scientist who performs gruesome experiments in his laboratory, and no one rushes to stop him.</p><br><br><p>"People like Magnus Zephyr are different from the scientists working in the departments. No one calls them scientists, though, more like researchers, engineers, or directors, depending on the position."</p><br><p>Lirla frowned, tapping her fingers on the table now and then, she seemed to have obvious envy in her gaze.</p><br><p>As an accomplished doctor, she too wished to stand so high as to be called a scientist and have her own lab with no restrictions for experimentation.</p><br><p>"Anyway, more about scientists and Magnus Zephyr you will understand when you come to see him. But, I'll warn you again, although it's open information and completely legal, his way is much more dangerous and risky. Moreover, there's no telling what he'll come up with this time. And... You can expect anything from a bastard like him..." Lirla bit her lip with a great frown.</p><br><p>Jena tilted her head, she wanted to ask about something that was bothering her.</p><br><p>"Mrs. Lirla, it was because Magnus Zephyr was an asshole that you got divorced, right?" Jena suggested.</p><br><p>"No!" Lirla replied menacingly before bringing her fist down on the table with all the anger in her gaze.</p><br><p>"That asshole dumped me, not me leaving him. His only argument was that I was too stupid! This is... This is just unimaginable!" Lirla replied, gritting her teeth.</p><br><p>Jena's eyes went wide. Adam was surprised too, but a confident smirk appeared on his face.</p><br><p>Whether Magnus did it because of his arrogance or there was some other reason, it showed that he was completely confident in his abilities and status.</p><br><p>'Hah, if for Magnus, Lirla is too dumb, then what is he capable of?' Adam pondered as he cast a glance at Lirla. She was the head of this department and oversaw Adam's treatment, but she was still nothing to Magnus.</p><br><p>It was either an indication of Magnus's genius, his arrogance, or both together.</p><br><p>"Agh, I take it asking you what you chose is useless, right?" Lirla glanced at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"Sure, but there's something I need to do before I do that..." Adam turned around as if looking for someone, then glanced at Jena.</p><br><p>"Hey... Silvana isn't here yet?"</p><br><p>Jena's face darkened, making Adam worried that something serious might have happened.</p><br><p>"I don't know, but... I think you should see her, in person. I know her pretty well, so... I'm sure she's at her house right now, waiting for you." Jena replied, rumpling her clothes with her fingers as she was nervous.</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly, not making any premature conclusions.</p><br><br><p>An hour later, after passing a few tests, Adam left the department and headed straight for Silvana's apartment.</p><br><p>He didn't want to think about it too much, but he couldn't help the fact that thoughts were literally filling his mind, and his anxiety was gradually growing.</p><br><br><p>Slowly, unhurriedly, Adam walked up the stairs, avoiding the elevator as if he wanted to delay this moment as long as possible.</p><br><p>Adam stopped in front of the door, took a deep breath, and opened it.</p><br><br><br><p>Amber liquid came out of the porcelain teapot, gradually filling three cups. A tall girl with green eyes and a long brown braid picked up the tray and headed into the hall where two men were sitting.</p><br><p>One of them had gray hair and rare amethyst eyes while the other had black hair and deep azure eyes.</p><br><p>"So... When you opened the door and saw this, right?" Tron asked with a calm look, reading some articles on the tablet.</p><br><p>"Tea's ready." Riska said, placing the cup first in front of Tron, then in front of Adam, and only then taking one for herself before sitting down modestly next to Tron, with a slight smile on her face.</p><br><p>Tron, as usual, was relaxed and serious at the same time. Well, now he had one more reason to be, for he had become a K3-Phantom, which was clear by his powerful aura.</p><br><p>"Thanks." Tron nodded slightly, shifting his gaze from Riska to Adam, "So...? Is that it?"</p><br><p>Adam gulped with a worried look.</p><br><p>"Yeah, I won't hide it, I was worried, but there's no way I could have expected this. As soon as I opened the door I saw Silvana, she must have spotted me from the cameras. I opened the door and saw her, on her knees with her forehead pressed to the ground, begging for my forgiveness...</p><br><p>Apparently, she feels extremely guilty for the way she acted at Salt Village..." Adam muttered while a slight pain echoed in his heart.</p><br><p>Tron raised an eyebrow, seeming surprised even though he was taken aback.</p><br><p>"And... After all that, you just ran away and decided to come here?"</p><br><p>Adam bit his lip, he was clearly ashamed of what he had done.</p><br><p>"Yes... I... I... I was just too damn confused. What was that all about anyway? I don't even think it was her fault, she was just worried about me, and we quickly resolved it on the battlefield.</p><br><p>But... She apologized so desperately as if she had committed the worst sin and ruined my life, it was frightening..."</p><br><p>Tron and Riska looked at each other. They hadn't been through this before, but since they knew what kind of person Silvana was, they understood the problem as the more experienced Phantom and Operator.</p><br><p>Tron sighed heavily, set the tablet aside, and put his hands together, looking intently at Adam.</p><br><p>"I see... Well, given the circumstances your reaction is understandable. Better to think things through properly than to take hasty action and make things worse, especially if you weren't expecting it." Tron said calmly, but his tone was serious.</p><br><p>"Shit. Her words are drilling my mind..." Adam clutched a hand to his face.</p><br><p>Tron nodded slightly, then leaned back on the couch, throwing one leg over the other.</p><br><p>"Well, I think we both realize that the problem is that Silvana has lost her confidence and coldness, she cares too much about you. What's more, she realizes it herself, but there's nothing she can do about making mistakes further, it's only getting worse for her."</p><br><p>Adam shook his head with a slight frown.</p><br><p>"Well..." Tron stretched out, "In that case, you have two options to solve this problem."</p><br><p>"Agh...?" Adam glanced at Tron, with hope in his gaze.</p><br><p>Adam didn't think that his and Silvana's little conflict in the ruins was worth what was happening now. After all, she wanted to protect him, nothing more.</p><br><p>"One, you two can talk things out, speak to each other, and work out this problem and your feelings in an organized routine. I won't hide it, I don't like that option." Tron narrowed his eyes.</p><br><p>"So... What's the second one?"</p><br><br><p>"Taking control, hard and uncompromising. You had a great duo, but one detail fell into the wrong place. All you need to do is forcefully get it back."</p><br><p>A gleam went across Tron's eyes.</p><br><p>"Let Silvana remember what she was like and, most importantly, remind her how strong you are! Your confidence or even arrogance should be enough for both of you! She shouldn't even have the idea that you might die in battle!"</p><br><p>Then, Tron's eyes became as cold as ice, and his voice turned low.</p><br><p>"Otherwise... If she believes that you can die in battle, then... it will definitely happen at some point."</p>
