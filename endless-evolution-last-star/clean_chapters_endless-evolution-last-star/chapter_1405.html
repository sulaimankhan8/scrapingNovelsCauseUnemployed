            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1405: Xander</strong></p><br><p>Beatra became the first opponent Adam faced after he became significantly stronger by obtaining the Desire of Beyond.</p><br><p>Sure, he didn’t take her completely seriously, as he understood that they were on different levels and there was no risk of death for either of them, which was an important factor in itself.</p><br><p>Still, thanks to his increased strength, he had the opportunity to learn something new, which he did.</p><br><p>Adam was one of those who discovered his new abilities during combat rather than through long training sessions. Only when he fought someone did he come up with ideas about how to use his abilities or energy.</p><br><p>So, even though Beatra couldn’t give him a decent fight like Ureyn or the Silver Weaver did, he should be grateful that she fought him to the end.</p><br><p>Moreover, the judge reduced all risks to zero.</p><br><br><p>The girl, the receptionist, stepped forward as she brought the energy box to her mouth to confirm the judge’s verdict:</p><br><p>“The winner of this fight is Adam Vinter! All bets will be paid out according to the rules and odds!”</p><br><p>For some of the spectators, this was joyful news, because they were the ones who had taken the risk and bet their money on the previously unknown fighter under the pseudonym A. V.</p><br><p>What about the rest?</p><br><p>Well, they had no choice but to take a deep breath and accept the situation as it was. They lost quite a lot of money, but at least they saw Adam Vinter in action and how the judge intervened. These were two rather rare events.</p><br><p>Despite the fact that Beatra lost, she didn’t feel bad. She was a little scared because Adam’s last attack could have actually killed her if it weren’t for the judge, but that just showed that it was a real fight and not a mock battle.</p><br><p>“Adam… Why did you come here?” she asked. “Actually, I want to know. You didn’t come here to fight me. I just happened to be here at the right time today, right?”</p><br><p>In response, Adam spread his arms with a slight smile.</p><br><p>“Well, what can I say? It’s just as you guessed. Even this morning, I didn’t know I would be coming to this arena, so yeah, my fight with you is just a coincidence.”</p><br><p>“Agh…” Beatra tilted her head as gloom reflected in her eyes. “I see.”</p><br><p>“But that doesn’t mean you need to be upset or that the fight wasn’t worth it. I think we both had a good time.”</p><br><p>Beatra looked up as light covered her expression. “Do you really think so?”</p><br><p>“Of course. I’m sure if I had come to this arena a year from now, the fight would have been much more difficult.”</p><br><p>“But…” She clenched her fists. “You would still be sure you would win, right?”</p><br><p>Adam smiled broadly. “Of course!”</p><br><p>“Hah…” Beatra shook her head. “There was no point in even asking.”</p><br><p>The judge stepped forward as he stared at Adam.</p><br><p>“What are you planning to do next? Will you continue fighting in the arena? I’m not sure there will be a spot for you, because apart from this short period, all the fights are scheduled until the evening.”</p><br><p>In response, Adam looked at the audience seats as he noticed several prominent auras, one of which was Erada. She had been waiting for this moment and immediately smiled when she realized what Adam wanted.</p><br><p>“I think that for the first time, one fight is more than enough for me.” Adam waved his hand, heading towards the exit. “I just want to get my reward, and I don’t mind talking to those who want to fight me later!”</p><br><p>Obviously, his last words were bait for the Hybrids, but could they ignore such an offer?</p><br><p>In the end, Adam disappeared into the dark passageway as Helasa stealthily did the same. He was gone, so she had nothing left to do here but collect her reward for the correct bet and move on to the next stage of their plan.</p><br><br><p>The judge’s firm hand patted Beatra on the shoulder encouragingly.</p><br><p>“You did great. Don’t take my intervention as a sign of weakness. I was just following the rules.”</p><br><p>“Yeah, I know. But… What was that terrifying control over energy he showed?” Beatra frowned, remembering the last moments of their fight.</p><br><p>The judge sighed. “Well, he earned that energy. The last time I heard about Adam Vinter, he definitely didn’t have that kind of power. Remember this battle, but focus on yourself and your path. That will be the best way to become stronger.”</p><br><br><p>“Good.” The judge nodded. “I hope to see you soon. It’s always interesting to watch your fights.”</p><br><p>Thus, the judge disappeared, Adam left, and the spectators began to disperse. Many remained in their seats, waiting for the next fight, which was to begin in 20 minutes with other fighters, while others hurried to find Adam and talk to him. It was an opportunity that many monsters interested in fighting did not want to miss.</p><br><p>“Tsk.” Beatra kicked a pebble on the ground. “It’s kind of a useful defeat, yeah? But I wanted to win, damn it!”</p><br><br><p>At the same time, Helasa came out of her chamber as she bumped into Adam in a dark passageway lit only by a few dim red lights.</p><br><p>“Looks like you decided to carry out our plan 110%, hm?” Helasa raised an eyebrow, looking at him judgmentally.</p><br><p>“Hey, why are you looking at me like that?” Adam chuckled, throwing on his coat. “We had to attract attention, so I did it.”</p><br><p>“Yes, it’s true, you did it, perhaps too well.”</p><br><p>It was obvious that Erada was one of those who wanted to meet Adam.</p><br><p>But someone had beaten her and everyone else to it.</p><br><p>“Ahem.” A man with long black hair coughed as he stepped out of the shadows. “Sorry to bother you, but I think we can help each other.”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Helasa was alert.</p><br><p>Adam glanced at the man. “You are?”</p><br><p>“My name is Xander. I represent the Black Fang Troupe, a group of Hybrids.”</p><br><br><p>“This is what you need, isn’t it, Adam Vinter?”</p>
