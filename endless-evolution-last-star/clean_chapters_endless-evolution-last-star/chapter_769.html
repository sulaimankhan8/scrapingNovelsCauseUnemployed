            <br><p>The First Wall was the Phantom's first step towards the K3, but as with all things, it was not a strict rule that all the Two Walls and Phantoms followed.</p><br><p>Everyone's energy, will, abilities, and path were different, and sometimes this could lead to unconventional outcomes despite expectations of something normal, predictable.</p><br><p>It was unknown how much time had passed since Adam's plunge into darkness, but soon he slowly opened his eyes.</p><br><p>He was in his inner space, but it seemed to be something deeper, a forbidden place where Lone Blaze, his Nexus, the artifact, or the Vault could not go.</p><br><p>Adam didn't even see his Evolution Tree here, though he sensed its presence, it seemed that the Evolution Tree didn't want to show itself early.</p><br><p>The only object that was in front of Adam was the Two Walls, both at once since their progress was linked, especially in Adam's case.</p><br><p>The Second Wall was lurking in the shadows, its moment hadn't arrived yet, but the First Wall was actively trembling, it was finally waiting for Adam to make the next move.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>One shard after another fell from the First Wall, sharp blades ready to plunge into the darkness, but at the last moment, something stopped them, forcing them to head for the Second Wall.</p><br><p>Adam was conscious, all his senses were under his full control, and he understood what was happening.</p><br><p>His heart was beating slowly, while his blue eyes were deeper than ever, watching the crucial event in his life.</p><br><p>Gradually, all the shards soared around the Second Wall, leaving not a piece of the First Wall, it was lost, forever.</p><br><p>The shards, like predators, watched the Second Wall, before simultaneously coming into motion.</p><br><p>Thrust. Thrust. Thrust.</p><br><p>One blade after another flew into the Second Wall, disappearing into its surface, gradually filling it with dense darkness.</p><br><p>With each blade absorbed, more and more cracks appeared in the Second Wall's surface, a little more, and it wouldn't be able to withstand the pressure.</p><br><p>This happened with the last shard that flew in.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The Second Wall trembled, trying to hold its shape, but it was no longer possible, there was no turning back, that's what Adam and the First Wall decided.</p><br><p>The Second Wall had no choice but to obey.</p><br><p>With a distortion of space, the Second Wall shrank into a black sphere, the size of a seed, then, with an active shudder, it disappeared, as if it was moved by a spatial anomaly.</p><br><p>Adam blinked several times in confusion.</p><br><p>He didn't know it, but usually, the Phantom had to go the same way as with the First Wall to destroy the Second Wall, yet for him all the work was done by his First Wall over a long time, following his path, had become too strong and impatient.</p><br><p>For a long time, nothing happened.</p><br><p>Adam stood alone in the middle of the darkness, with no concept of time, hearing and feeling nothing. It was unknown if he saw anything, as there was only darkness around him, if his eyes were closed he wouldn't have noticed the difference.</p><br><p>He didn't know what was wrong with his energy, with Silvana and with Lone Blaze, he had no information even about what was going on with his real body in the actual world.</p><br><p>Nevertheless, Adam was completely at peace, he had never in his life felt as peaceful as he did here, amidst the vast darkness and emptiness.</p><br><p>Soon, it was time for changes.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the spot where the Second Wall disappeared, the space shook again, returning in a new form.</p><br><p>Adam's mouth dropped open slightly, he was mesmerized, trying to figure out what the mysterious object's purpose was.</p><br><p>A bright white circle floated amidst the darkness, a pale blue mist filled with a myriad of glowing particles flowing in and out of its edges like the night sky holding millions of stars.</p><br><p>At the edges of the white circle were four empty cells at equal distances from each other. From each cell came out a dense white line, rapidly changing symbols covered it, heading towards the very center.</p><br><p>The center was shrouded in a thick fog, engulfing the ends of the lines.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, trying to see what was inside, but the tiny stars and fog prevented him from doing so, first, he had to fill in the four cells.</p><br><p>Suddenly, a calm, proud voice came from outside:</p><br><p>[Well... You're just trouble as always, aren't you? Even the Two Walls had to change to match you...]</p><br><p>Raising his head, Adam saw the Evolution Tree, he hadn't noticed when it revealed itself.</p><br><p>"Do you know what that is?"</p><br><p>Adam pointed to the hovering white circle, neither Silvana nor anyone else had ever mentioned that.</p><br><p>[Sure, you know it too. Just think about it, if it's known to me then it's true for you too...]</p><br><br><p>Confusion was evident on Adam's face, but before he could ask his next question, the answer appeared in his mind.</p><br><br><p>[Indeed, the Star Seal...]</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree grunted, it tried to appear serious and stern, but deep inside it was thrilled to see the Star Seal right after the destruction of the First Wall.</p><br><p>It was a series of events that most Phantoms didn't even know about, let alone count on it.</p><br><br><p>Adam took a few steps closer to the Star Seal, he wanted to see it up close.</p><br><p>"Oh, I wasn't expecting this..."</p><br><p>A bright light fell on his face, he had to raise his head to get a full view of the Star Seal, it was huge, much larger than Savage Broako, the closest comparison would be the main gate of a fortress.</p><br><p>Then, Adam's eyes traveled over the four empty cells, sadness filled his gaze.</p><br><p>"I see... I took one step forward, it took me this long, but I need to fill them all, it's going to be a long time..."</p><br><p>[Hm? What are you talking about?]</p><br><p>"What?" Adam tilted his head in confusion.</p><br><p>[You've already collected most of it... let me show you...]</p><br><p>At the same moment, space trembled as three stars appeared beside Adam.</p>
