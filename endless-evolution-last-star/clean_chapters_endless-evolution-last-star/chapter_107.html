            <br><p>The third wave, soon the fourth one, passed without notable problems or casualties. A few Phantoms were wounded, some had to leave the battlefield at the risk of death, but 80% of their squad was ready to continue fighting, and 60% still had quite a bit of energy. Only a small fraction was exhausted.</p><br><p>"Damn, I doubted the effectiveness of the military, but this is actually impressive." Adam muttered, looking at the group of monsters in the distance.</p><br><p>Snow Imots were heading towards Phantom, who was busy fighting the Horned Lizard, but he didn't need to worry about his safety.</p><br><p>Whoooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>One of the many laser turrets on the walls fired, releasing a dense beam of electromagnetic energy. The turret's battery instantly dropped to zero, quickly starting to charge from the thick wires running along the walls - to the generators inside Bastion.</p><br><p>In no time, the laser reached its target - causing a devastating explosion and ripping the flesh of the Snow Imots apart. Blobs of snow flew off to the sides, along with ice crystals for the painful roars of the monsters.</p><br><p>However, the laser turrets couldn't kill Blue Threat Level monsters, since Green Threat Level was their maximum under the right circumstances.</p><br><p>However, injuring or simply stopping the Snow Imots was more than enough for the Phantoms to take action in time.</p><br><p>Given the inhuman speed and reflexes of the Phantoms, the help of the military, and the direction of the Operators, it was all becoming a single mechanism that worked without fault.</p><br><p>Still, that was until something would interfere with the process, something formidable and breaking the established rules.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The ground shook as tall silhouettes appeared in the distance - each taller than ten meters, and it seemed to be because of the distortion, for by the obvious rumbling, they were approaching true giants!</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes, trying to get a good look at the monsters through the fast wind with thick particles of snow blowing from side to side.</p><br><p>Massive feet sank to the ground, shattering the ice under their unsupportable weight. Dense plates of ice covered the giants' entire bodies, especially their broad chests and long, sprawling arms with few joints. Sharp crystals surrounded their wrists like bracelets, carrying only death and majesty.</p><br><p>Their heads were connected to their bodies not by a neck, but by a single layer of ice going to their shoulders, covering them tightly like a hood.</p><br><p>"Someone they remind me of..." Adam muttered, remembering one of his most difficult opponents.</p><br><p>'Yes, there are indeed similarities between Artic Colossuses and Stone Goliaths. However, Artic Colossuses are much stronger because they are Purple Threat Level. Their weaknesses are the cores in their chests, but you can't see them since they're hidden by thick ice armor.' Silvana explained.</p><br><p>Adam nodded, clutching his needle tightly. He knew that the large monsters were formidable creatures. Sure, they were slow, but you had to reach them first to take advantage of that.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Artic Colossus, who walked ahead of the others, raised its massive arm, extending it forward.</p><br><p>Then, the crystals on its wrist shone brightly and rained down on the group of Phantoms not far from Adam.</p><br><p>A few seconds later, the crystals were already flying over him with powerful wind streams. Then, Adam could have done something about it, but he froze in place as fragments from the past flashed through his mind.</p><br><p>The scene of the stones thrown by Prime Stone Goliath tearing the Phantoms apart was seared into his mind. It was the first time he'd seen that even a Phantom's life could be cut short in an instant by something as simple as the throw of a sharp stone.</p><br><p>In this case, however, Adam's help was not needed. It was unlikely that he could intercept every crystal or destroy it. There was someone among the captains with the right abilities for the case.</p><br><p>"Get behind me! Huddle up!" Owen shouted, holding out a shield in front of him.</p><br><p>The phantoms reacted quickly, they knew that if it was Owen, they had nothing to worry about. Some even used the ability to get to a safe zone faster.</p><br><p>Owen smirked, raising his shield slightly and letting the ice crystals crash into it. He didn't use Order or his Nexus, for it simply wasn't necessary.</p><br><p>Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam.</p><br><p>Ice crystals shattered against Owen's shield, meeting the impenetrable defense like an unbreakable fortress.</p><br><p>But... Such a perfect defense seemed to be not enough for Owen.</p><br><p>"Tsk. This is too boring!" Owen smirked before swinging his shield to the side and clenching his fist tightly.</p><br><p>Such careless behavior was to be punished by fate, for the last crystal had not yet had time to hit the shield and was heading straight for Owen's chest.</p><br><p>However, Owen's fist proved stronger, colliding with the crystal and shattering it as solidly as glass.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide with surprise for a moment. He wasn't sure he could do the same, even after getting Power Gene and Elemental Root.</p><br><p>'Hmm, high defense, especially against ice. Moreover, unlike everyone else, he's dressed like on a forest hike, not to the northern gate.' Adam pondered, glancing at Owen, who was wearing a black leather jacket and wide pants with a large belt.</p><br><p>'Is it possible that he has Elemental Root too? His main element is ice?' Adam suggested, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.</p><br><p>The young man stepped forward and bowed low before Owen.</p><br><p>"Thank you! Those crystals looked dangerous! I don't even know what would have happened to us if you hadn't intervened!"</p><br><p>Owen smirked, lighting a cigarette.</p><br><p>"Don't sweat it. Just buy me a drink sometime, and we're even."</p><br><p>The young man raised his head as he wanted to say something.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>However, a powerful earth tremor interrupted him, drawing the attention of the other Phantoms as well.</p><br><p>The Artic Colossuses hadn't disappeared anywhere, for Owen just deflected the attack of one of them. The monsters were slowly getting closer, and in less than a minute, they would be right in front of their squad.</p><br><p>"Damn, they look formidable. It's probably because of their size though." Owen scratched the back of his head with a nonchalant look.</p><br><p>Alexia raised an eyebrow, then she turned to Fred.</p><br><p>"Hey, you can get rid of them, can't you?"</p><br><p>Fred narrowed his azure eyes while the cold wind made his gray hair slightly ripple.</p><br><p>"Suppose. But, I don't want to waste too much energy on them. There are stronger opponents ahead of us. I'd rather leave my abilities for later stages."</p><br><p>Alexia frowned slightly as her aura increased.</p><br><p>However, their clash was not destined to happen, for Bryda stepped forward.</p><br><p>"No need to fight. If Fred wants to save energy, then fine. I can deal with them instead. Either way, this night, each of us will have to use all our abilities. I don't mind being first." Bryda said sincerely, clutching the book, her Nexus, to her chest.</p><br><br><p>"Good. Just hurry up. They'll be attacking again soon. I don't want anyone to die from a little thing like these guys." Alexia nonchalantly said clearly not considering the Artic Colossuses as menacing opponents.</p><br><p>Bryda nodded silently as her eyes shone brightly and the book shook.</p>
