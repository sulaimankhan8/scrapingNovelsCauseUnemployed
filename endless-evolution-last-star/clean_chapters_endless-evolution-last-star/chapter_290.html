            <br><p>The Giant Rogoes glanced around and one of them stepped forward, pointing its open palm paw at Adam. He was going to crush Adam with his power, just turning him into a bloody blur.</p><br><p>Katrin narrowed her eyes, she didn't understand why Adam was inactive. He just waited for Giant Rogo's paw to approach him with a slight smile on his face.</p><br><p>Then, when the paw fully covered Adam, he came into motion. It wasn't some cunning plan or trap, no, Adam just wanted to check something out.</p><br><br><p>Adam's palm touched the paw of a monster that was bigger than him. Strangely enough, Adam was able to stop Giant Rogo.</p><br><p>"RGGGHHHHH!!!" Giant Rogo growled irritably, trying to crush Adam. His muscles tensed up wanting to destroy Adam and smash him to the ground, but... the results were dismal.</p><br><p>Adam's feet sank into ash, not because he was losing and was soon ready to fall under Giant Rogo's pressure, but because the ground wasn't strong enough.</p><br><p>"Oh, I see... Though I realized this quite some time ago, it's only now that I've had a chance to test it out and experience it fully." Adam smirked, while a silver needle was ready to appear in his right hand.</p><br><p>He did so for a simple reason - he had defeated a Thunder Demon that was much stronger than any Giant Rogo, the difference in strength between them was monstrous. However... the human mind did not fully understand this.</p><br><p>If a child or an ordinary person not related to Dead Lands saw a huge Giant Rogo and Thunder Demon whose size was much smaller, he would think that it was Giant Rogo who was the most dangerous and strongest monster among them.</p><br><p>The logic was very simple - the bigger and scarier the monster looked, the stronger it was. That's what a person unfamiliar with Dead Lands would think and that's what the human brain thought.</p><br><p>Sure, the Phantoms, Operators, and military realized that Thunder Demon was capable of killing Giant Rogo in seconds, but the difference in their size still caused dissonance.</p><br><p>Katrin raised an eyebrow. She wasn't worried about Adam, after all, she knew what he was capable of, but the scene in front of her still looked strange.</p><br><p>A man, just under two meters tall, had stopped the paw of a monster the size of a house with his hand. If there had been a firmer surface under Adam and not crumbly ash, it wouldn't have moved.</p><br><p>"Fine, you could say that little experiment is complete." Adam nodded slightly.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>At the very moment Adam was about to attack and cut Giant Rogo's paw apart, from outside, came a piercing whistle of wind.</p><br><p>Katrin's eyes shifted sideways when, in the sky amidst the black earth and dark smoke from the constant fire, a bright white flash appeared.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the flash slammed into Giant Rogo's head, blasting it into many pieces. Scraps of flesh flew off to the sides with strong protective scales.</p><br><p>Then, Giant Rogo's massive body crashed to the ground with a rumble, raising waves of ash. Adam and Katrin had to cover themselves with their hands to keep the ash out of their mouths and eyes.</p><br><p>"What the fuck is going on here!?" Katrin shouted irritably, looking around.</p><br><br><p>From behind, there were heavy footsteps, but not of a monster, but of a man. Katrin saw a tall shadow that quickly swept by her and jumped on the back of the decapitated Giant Rogo's.</p><br><p>Katrin narrowed her eyes examining the man with short black hair, a recently shaved beard, and a fiery gaze filled with enthusiasm.</p><br><p>In his hands was a huge two-handed sword with a silver blade sharpened on both sides and a golden stripe running down the center. The guard was massive and the hilt was long and strong enough to hold such a large weapon with two hands.</p><br><p>It was obviously his Nexus, neither Katrin nor Adam had ever seen someone's Nexus this big before.</p><br><p>The man glanced at Katrin, smiled, and leaped forward towards the second Giant Rogo.</p><br><p>Before the monster could do anything, the man was in front of the monster, holding onto the monster's massive scales with one hand like a climber on a mountain.</p><br><p>Then, there was a glint in the man's eyes as he thrust his huge sword with all his might into Giant Rogo's chest, plunging the broad blade full length.</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head, he was puzzled not understanding who this man was and why he was so confident in his abilities.</p><br><p>Yeah, that attack looked spectacular, but Giant Rogo was too big a monster to be killed by such an attack. The man's sword was broad, but the most such an attack could do was leave a deep cut in Giant Rogo's chest.</p><br><p>"Hah, you're pretty big bastards, aren't you? Good thing I have a way to deal with you quickly and efficiently!"</p><br><p>At the same moment, the man's eyes shone brightly as through the sword passed arrays of golden energy heading straight for the monster's chest.</p><br><p>"Oh, not bad." Katrin muttered as if knowing what would happen next.</p><br><p>The light began to tear the monster's chest from the inside out, cracks releasing outward golden light spreading all over the monster's chest, bringing imminent death.</p><br><p>The man smirked and pulled his sword out of the monster's flesh with a sharp movement, a few drops of dark blood flew in front of his confident eyes.</p><br><p>The movement was the catalyst for the detonation.</p><br><p>Light burst out blasting the monster's chest into small pieces. Head, paws, and legs flew off to the sides, crashing into piles of ash.</p><br><p>A huge surge of blood mixed with chunks of flesh covered the site of the explosion, seeking to soak into the black ash and pour over the bones of the long-dead monsters.</p><br><p>The blood headed towards the man, about to completely cover him like the final attack of a defeated Giant Rogo, but the man was ready for it.</p><br><p>"Hah, I won't let the monster's blood touch me!" The man exclaimed with a joyful smile before swinging his sword from bottom to top.</p><br><p>Considering his strength and the size of his sword, this swing caused active air currents that like an invisible barrier threw the drops of blood aside.</p><br><p>Adam just took a few steps back, looking at the drops of blood that fell in front of his feet, quickly disappearing into the ashes.</p><br><p>"Nice! We killed two more and saved our fellow Phantoms!" The man clenched his fist with a wide grin, rejoicing in his latest victory.</p><br><p>Adam and Katrin looked at each other in confusion.</p><br><p>They didn't understand what was going on here, but it was the man's words that caught their attention the most.</p><br><p>'Wait...? Is he talking about us? Is he saying he just saved us?' Adam and Katrin's thoughts were reflected in their eyes. They realized they were thinking the same thing without words.</p><br><br><p>Then, from the north side, avoiding collision with the other Giant Rogoes and Igno Ants, three Phantoms headed towards them. One of them was a girl with long black hair and stern green eyes.</p><br><p>She was no different from most Phantoms except for the fact that behind her back was a massive sniper rifle almost as big as herself.</p><br><p>Adam frowned slightly. He didn't have any negativity towards this girl since he had met her for the first time today.</p><br><p>But he had bad memories of sniper rifles in general. It was a shot from such a weapon by a dark Phantom that had killed two of his fellows - Barna and Sirgus.</p><br><p>Katrin gritted her teeth as she watched the approaching Phantoms. She had already realized that they would only give her a headache and nothing more.</p>
