            <br><p>A bright pain filled Adam's mind calling for panic, but after a few seconds, he realized that there was nothing to fear.</p><br><p>The energy currents left on his hand the mark of a purple four-pointed rune, from time to time it flashed showing that it was ready to activate.</p><br><br><p>Several urns to the side shattered, causing Adam to turn around. The Dark Walker fell right on them, slowly rising from the sharp ceramic shards.</p><br><p>With a short growl, the Dark Walker continued onward as before paying Adam no attention, or rather... no aggression.</p><br><p>Adam could see that the monster was staring greedily at his hand, at the four-pointed rune, but there was nothing he could do. Read exclusive chapters at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"Interesting..." Adam muttered raising his hand.</p><br><p>For some reason, he wanted to use the rune right now, that's what his instincts told him, and...</p><br><p>[Act... It's always better to know than to wander in ignorance....]</p><br><p>His Evolution Tree had the same opinion.</p><br><p>The smirk on Adam's face told Silvana what he was going to do.</p><br><p>'Wait! Adam, this could be dangerous!'</p><br><p>However, it was already too late.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes shone brightly, and his energy traveled to his hand, activating a four-pointed rune, one of many that he would encounter on his way through the fortress.</p><br><p>The rune responded to his call, releasing its energy - it flowed powerfully throughout Adam's body as well as his wounded shoulder.</p><br><p>As the rune's energy drained away, Adam's wound disappeared with it.</p><br><p>The corners of his lips went up, forming a satisfied smile.</p><br><p>"Oh, it seems the External Artifact doesn't agree with the effect of the energy here. Hah, looks like it was a mistake to use the rune so early." Adam lowered his eyes, there was nothing else on his hand.</p><br><p>He got one rune and could use it once.</p><br><p>Silvana's annoyed voice didn't take long to arrive:</p><br><p>'Damn, Adam! This could have been your only opportunity to heal your wounds! You wasted it on a few scratches!'</p><br><p>Though Adam didn't see Silvana, from her voice he could sense that her fists were tightly clenched and her cheeks puffed up with a menacing look.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, don't worry, the fortress is big, and as far as I understand it extends to the whole area. Moreover, I don't need the help of a hostile artifact."</p><br><p>With a carefree wave of his hand, Adam headed onward, following the ripples from the black particles. It wasn't in his plans to clear the fortress entirely, he didn't know if he could do that and it wasn't his goal.</p><br><br><p>Thus, a few passages later, Adam encountered the next stream of flames appearing in a random place.</p><br><p>However, this time he didn't have time to fight for it, since the fortress' External Artifact didn't create runes specifically for him, they just appeared, saturated with the energy that the monsters needed.</p><br><p>"Oh... How curious..." Adam muttered as he watched the unusual scene.</p><br><p>The Dark Walkers who ran towards the flames in hopes of consuming the rune were forced to stand aside as someone stronger, the Dark Watcher, moved in for the rune.</p><br><p>'I see... As soon as I walked a bit deeper into the fortress I met the first of them. Before that I'd only seen the exhausted Dark Walkers, there's no way they could pass as worthy opponents.'</p><br><p>Then, Adam's gaze caught on something else.</p><br><p>The rune hovering above the stream of flame wasn't four-pointed, it was a three-pointed rune, one line going down and the other two branching off to the sides.</p><br><p>As soon as the Dark Watcher's powerful hand touched the flame the same thing happened to the monster as it did to Adam.</p><br><p>However, the monster immediately absorbed all the energy and became a little stronger, it was felt by its aura, and a three-pointed rune appeared on its heavy armor, blinking slowly.</p><br><p>Adam was about to leave when a purple glow reflected in the corner of his eye. His expression changed drastically as he realized that another flame was about to appear nearby.</p><br><p>"Oh, no... Don't tell me you..."</p><br><p>His gaze went to the Dark Watcher, who, like many Shadow Walkers, stared at him with a hungry glare.</p><br><p>As if that was the artifact's intent, the glow stopped at the stone slab next to Adam, causing a bright burst of flame.</p><br><p>'Why don't you try running away?' Silvana suggested.</p><br><p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head with an unsure look.</p><br><p>"Well, I think I'll take the fight this time, there's only one Dark Watcher here, so it's a good opportunity to see what they're capable of."</p><br><p>As with the guards in front of the gate the Dark Watcher had a long spear as its main weapon and its armor was a bright purple color, different from the black armor of the guards.</p><br><p>"Fine, let's fight for another rune." Adam waved his hand, summoning his needle.</p><br><p>He expected to be attacked by the Shadow Walkers or for the Dark Watcher to point its spear at him, but instead, the monster simply pointed its hand at Adam.</p><br><br><p>Bafflement was evident in Adam's gaze, but soon his eyes went wide.</p><br><p>The three-pointed rune shone brightly releasing all its energy on the monster's hand. Before Adam could realize anything, a projectile of dense energy was flying at him, a massive purple arrow capable of piercing any obstacle with its sharp tip.</p><br><p>Active vibrations spread from the arrowhead, creating a threatening wave whose sole target was Adam.</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam wanted to use his artifact to gain acceleration from the lightning, but he quickly remembered that this ability was changed by Silvana's star.</p><br><p>However, Adam didn't hesitate, he quickly jumped aside, dodging the arrow at the last moment. The powerful energy touched the corner of his coat, tearing it apart even though the dense monster threads were stitched throughout the fabric.</p><br><p>With a somersault, Adam quickly got to his feet, looking back toward the projectile.</p><br><p>Under his mesmerized gaze, the arrow crashed into the nearest wall, for a moment illuminating part of the fortress with a bright light, the flash visible even from the top of the fighter.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Aggressive streams of purple energy, like fire, erupted from the explosion, tearing the bodies of the nearest Dark Walkers apart, chunks of flesh flying off to the sides along with dark debris from the great wall.</p><br><p>Adam gulped, staring at the hollow in the wall after the explosion, remembering that he barely scratched the gate.</p><br><p>Then, his eyes traveled to the flame stream, staring at its rune that was different from the previous two, that one being five-pointed.</p>
