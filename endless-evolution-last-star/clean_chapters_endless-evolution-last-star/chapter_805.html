            <br><p>Goosebumps went down the Crimson Monarch's body, he had not felt like this in a long time. Once again he would have to pay dearly for his desire to take Adam rather than kill him.</p><br><p>Their gazes met, for the first time only one of them was calm, while inside the other, panic was slowly building up.</p><br><p>The purple energy covered Adam's fingertips - his next, smooth sweep left a simple white line in the air, seemingly carrying no threat.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's pupils dilated, he felt genuine fear from the unknown ability that Adam left as one of his last trump cards.</p><br><p>The white line disappeared into the void of space, leaving behind only flecks of purple flame.</p><br><br><p>Streams of blood comparable to the flow of a great river gushed from the Crimson Monarch. From his shoulder to his waist, his body was cut open, neither bone nor flesh able to resist Adam's simple attack.</p><br><p>Thoughts of death filled the Crimson Monarch's mind. Even after a direct hit from Adam's gravity punch, he did not feel in such great danger.</p><br><p>But... Adam and Katrin weren't the only ones capable of becoming stronger during battle. This was not the case for the Crimson Monarch, yet this episode allowed him to remember that he was mortal.</p><br><p>He remembered what it was like to fight seriously.</p><br><p>The corners of the Crimson Monarch's lips went up as his eyes shone brightly like ghostly lanterns.</p><br><p>Under the forcefully accelerated regeneration, flesh fibers like threads flew out from the edges, connecting the two nearly separated parts of his body.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide in disbelief. He knew that aside from the thunder the Crimson Monarch possessed powerful regeneration, but this was practically Regenerative Monsters level.</p><br><p>'Shit... Unlike them, the Crimson Monarch isn't just a punching bag, he's a real monster, but...'</p><br><p>His eyes traveled forward for a moment, behind the Crimson Monarch's back. Katrin's body shook with pain, but her face was devoid of emotion.</p><br><p>'We're not far behind him.'</p><br><p>Then... everything in the serpent lands ceased to matter except the desires of three certain individuals.</p><br><p>Adam, Katrin, and the Crimson Monarch began to fight like wild beasts. Reminiscent of the endless battle between the Dormant Lord and the Blind Sinner, but on a larger scale. Now, these two were spectators instead of the center of attention.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, in the Citadel, a group of people in black clothes hurriedly moved towards a simple-looking building, home to many residents.</p><br><br><p>With a kick of his foot, a man kicked the door, holding a pistol with both hands he quickly went inside, the team followed him exploring every corner.</p><br><p>Slowly they reached the last room, realizing that they were the only ones who broke into this house uninvited.</p><br><p>The man's eyes lowered as he looked at the girl with shoulder-length black hair, blue lights reflected in the pool of blood from the many screens towering above her desk.</p><br><p>The military men had seen a lot in their careers, but some of them had to turn away at the sight of Silvana's mangled left arm. Just thinking about how much it hurt made them uncomfortable.</p><br><p>Then, the man nodded deeply, touching the earpiece in his ear.</p><br><p>"This is the captain of Squad Four. Silvana Desio was not attacked from the outside, we have not detected anything suspicious. But... she's badly injured. I'll send a photo."</p><br><p>Within seconds, the information was in the hands of the military analysts. Strangely enough, they couldn't solve the mystery quickly.</p><br><p>Someone rubbing his chin thought it might have been a monster, but... monsters simply couldn't appear in the Citadel, especially without breaking into the Operator's house.</p><br><p>"Hmm... Strange." The woman with glasses muttered, "If it was a human, what's the point of doing that to her arm? It's not even torture, it's the wrath of a wild beast, and... after something like that, the perpetrator just walked away?"</p><br><p>Soon, someone realized that her wound was identical to Adam's. Then, the young man saw that Adam no longer had such a wound.</p><br><p>His eyes went wide, joy filling his gaze. He jumped up sharply from his seat ready to tell of his find.</p><br><br><p>Before he could rise, someone's palm fell on his shoulder.</p><br><p>A man in a strict suit, with chin-length black hair looked up at him with a sly smile.</p><br><p>He slowly raised his arm, putting his index finger to his lips, black gloves covering his hands.</p><br><p>"Good work, but there's no need to shout about it."</p><br><p>The young man gulped. The man didn't say anything specific to him, but... his gut felt a threat lurking behind the calm words. His body sat back in the chair, staring at one point for a while.</p><br><br><p>Black shoes tapped on the flat floor, the man's rhythmic, steady stride echoed through the empty hallway, his arms folded neatly behind his back.</p><br><p>In the distance was a door leading to a single military man who knew more than most of the Citadel's inhabitants.</p><br><br><p>Slash. Slash. Slash.</p><br><p>Splashes of blood whipped before the Crimson Monarch, but Adam and Katrin did not escape their endless clashes unscathed.</p><br><p>However... due to Katrin's recklessness and Adam's rare but accurate white cuts, the Crimson Monarch was slowly reaching its limit.</p><br><p>He had no time to reinforce the monsters, there was no one for hundreds of meters near them. Even the strongest monsters were afraid to approach. The wrong time and place could lead them to instant death.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch's face twisted, electrical discharges filled his body as his gauntlets shone brightly.</p><br><p>"Get away from me! You two mad warriors!"</p><br><p>In a bright flash, the gauntlets exploded, throwing Adam and Katrin off with a powerful electrical blast. Thunder bolts rained down from the sky, making the area around the Crimson Monarch unapproachable.</p><br><p>Adam and Katrin glanced over. She was breathing heavily but was ready to fight on.</p><br><p>'What does he have left?' Adam narrowed his eyes, 'That's his last trump card... I can feel it.'</p><br><p>Then, with a cold face, the Crimson Monarch shoved his hand sharply into the jaw of the snake resting on his shoulder.</p><br><p>The snake's pupils narrowed as its jaw opened wider and wider, releasing a long object with a red handle.</p><br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch waved his hand sharply, drops of blood flying off the three sharp tips of his real weapon - the trident.</p><br><br><p>His voice was deep and commanding.</p><br><p>"I admit, you were not wrong about this maiden. But..."</p><br><p>With a dark look, the Crimson Monarch raised his hand, pointing the trident directly at Adam.</p><br><p>"This only proves that I will take you at any cost."</p>
