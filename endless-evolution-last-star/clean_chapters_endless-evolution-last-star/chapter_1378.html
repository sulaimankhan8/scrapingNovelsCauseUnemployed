            <h4>Chapter 1378: Order of Desire</h4><br><p>Slash. Slash. Slash.
</p><br><p>With each swing, branches and splinters flew off. Each of the Silver Weaver’s movements reverberated strongly throughout the Evolution Tree, but it was not torture, rather, it was a necessary process that had to be done as quickly as possible.
</p><br><p>Every second in the real world brought Adam closer to death, and only when he evolved thanks to the Silver Weaver’s actions, would the energy burst be powerful enough to save him even in such a situation.
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver did not destroy the top of the Evolution Tree, because all the cut branches hung in the air waiting for him to decide to use them.
</p><br><p>Why did the Silver Weaver do this?
</p><br><p>At that moment, the top of the Evolution Tree was in the crown form, where two main branches and many small branches intertwined at the front, at the base of which was the Branch Crystal.
</p><br><p>But the Branch Crystal was now useless and had been destroyed. The Silver Weaver had to rebuild his new domain in such a way that the energy would flow as efficiently as possible.
</p><br><p>This was necessary not only to save Adam, but also for the power of future abilities.
</p><br><p>Sure, the Evolution Tree would have liked to avoid this, but it was impossible, and it understood that.
</p><br><br><p>After only a few minutes, the Silver Weaver finished with one last swing.
</p><br><p>He looked around, assessing his work.
</p><br><p>The edges of the top still formed the crown shape, but inside, everything was covered with chopped branches over which fragments of crystals floated.
</p><br><p>"That will be enough." The Silver Weaver nodded before standing in the very center and raising his needle high, holding the handle with both hands. "It will hurt one last time, I promise you."
</p><br><p>Before the Evolution Tree could respond, the Silver Weaver plunged his needle into the center, just as he had pierced Adam’s chest earlier.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>At the same time, the space began to shake violently as the Silver Weaver closed his eyes.
</p><br><p>At his will, all the severed branches began to move, actively intertwining with each other, covering the surface of the top.
</p><br><p>His energy divided into four snow-white streams that quickly made their way from the edges of the top to the very center, becoming silver rivers that constantly filled the center with energy in an endless cycle.
</p><br><p>Finally, the needle of the Silver Weaver itself broke into pieces, becoming one with the fragments of the destroyed Branch Crystal.
</p><br><p>Under his watchful gaze, they took on a completely new form.
</p><br><br><p>The Silver Weaver sighed heavily before taking a few steps back.
</p><br><p>With pride in his eyes, he looked at the white orb hovering above a tiny lake of the purest energy, which surpassed even the depths of the Evolution Tree of Energy Axis in quality.
</p><br><p>In the orb, an image of the Silver Weaver appeared, the very one Adam had killed on his first day.
</p><br><p>Then... the Silver Weaver took his place in front of the orb before closing his eyes.
</p><br><p>"Good. Everything went perfectly." The Silver Weaver nodded deeply as he looked around, watching the calm darkness surrounding him and the light coming from afar.
</p><br><p>Now, he, like Lone Blaze, was inside the orb, for it had become his domain.
</p><br><p>Only one last detail remained.
</p><br><br><p>The Silver Weaver snapped his fingers as the white lake trembled, causing a blinding light to burst from the orb.
</p><br><p>The silver rivers shuddered as wave after wave of energy ran through the Evolution Tree, reaching its deepest depths where the Energy Axis was located.
</p><br><p>After the victory over Ureyn, there was now too much energy in Adam’s inner space for his body to withstand.
</p><br><p>However, since then, in addition to the Energy Axis, there was also the Silver Weaver, and all this energy had already been absorbed, so there were no negative effects.
</p><br><p>[Great... With this power, Adam will have no problem obtaining the Dark Heart... This will lead him straight to the Second Grand Star...]
</p><br><p>The Evolution Tree continued to shake violently as the energy would soon reach its peak power and burst out into the real world.
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver nodded as he stared at the Path Construct.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, although whether the battle will be easy or difficult depends entirely on which Hybrid comes out against Adam. You know, he’s not the type to look for easy opponents. It’s his curse and his blessing."
</p><br><p>[Hah... That’s true... But maybe this time it will be different? This time he practically died... And the White Spire had nothing to do with it, his power practically caused his own death...]
</p><br><p>The Silver Weaver remained silent, watching as the darkness of the inner space disappeared for a moment, as only white energy filled everything around.
</p><br><br><p>Twitch. Twitch. Twitch.
</p><br><p>Adam’s fingers twitched while blood continued to flow from his numerous wounds.
</p><br><p>Suddenly, he opened his eyes, which quickly returned from gray and lifeless to their rich blue light, full of strength and desire to move forward.
</p><br><p>The white flame engulfed him, immediately heading for his chest and heart, the most serious wounds.
</p><br><p>Like threads, the energy bound his flesh and edges together, as well as filling the hollows where rich blood had previously flowed.
</p><br><br><p>In just a minute, Adam took his first, ragged breath, and soon after, his heart began to beat again.
</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.
</p><br><p>With each heartbeat, his recovery accelerated, and energy flowed actively through his body.
</p><br><p>Sure, even this wasn’t enough to heal Adam from all the cuts, scratches, and bruises he had received during the fight, but he would definitely be able to get rid of the critical and serious wounds.
</p><br><p>The sound of waves crashing against the rocky shore reached Adam’s ears as a slight smile formed on his face.
</p><br><p>"Grh... I’m practically resurrected, aren’t I?" He rolled onto his side, struggling to get up from the ground. "Maybe I should make today my second birthday? What’s the date today?"
</p><br><p>Not immediately, but Adam got to his feet as he enjoyed the first refreshing breeze until the floating runes caught his attention.
</p><br><p>[Desire Gene was formed. Your Desire of Beyond, the Silver Weaver stands at the head of this domain.]
</p><br><p>Adam smiled as his gaze turned to the most important part.
</p><br><p>[Order of Desire was created.]</p>
