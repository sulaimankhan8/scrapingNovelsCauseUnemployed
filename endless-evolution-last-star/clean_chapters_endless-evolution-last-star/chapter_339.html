            <br><br><p>The white projectile slammed into the sword, lighting everything up with a bright flash and causing the sword to start actively spinning trying to absorb the impulse.</p><br><p>Oskar's eyes went wide as his sword came dangerously close before plunging sharply into the wall. The wide blade went deep into the cold stone, right next to Osark's face, leaving a long scratch on his cheek.</p><br><p>"F-Fucking hell..." Oskar gulped, a chill ran down his back and goosebumps covered his entire body. Never in his life had he been so close to death.</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes staring intently at Plague Reaper, who didn't bother to do anything further.</p><br><p>'I see... Considering he threw the sword and used such a move, he wanted to kill Oskar right here and now. However... he doesn't do anything, which means he doesn't have any ranged attacks in his arsenal.'</p><br><p>"Yes!" Erla exclaimed vigorously, clenching her fist tightly with a radiant smile. It may not have gone as smoothly as she had planned, but she was able to throw off the sword's trajectory and save Oskar.</p><br><p>Oskar's heart began to beat faster. He realized that even taking Erla's shot into account, the sword had practically pierced his head. That he was still alive was pure luck, as Plague Reaper's throw was flawless.</p><br><p>'No... I said it was useless, but they still managed to convince me to try this strike, and... what happened in the end? That monster just ate my arm and nailed me to the wall. I'm not even sure I can get back on my feet in my current state...'</p><br><p>Oskar's eyes went to Erla, but his gaze didn't linger on her for long, and hurried to Plague Reaper, who was staring irritatedly at the Oskar sealed into the wall.</p><br><p>'Agh... He's only one and he's already practically killed someone from Golden Light Squad, he's practically killed me...' Oskar pondered internally while his eyes filled with more and more fear, 'Yes, I have to run, as soon as I get a chance I have to get out of here. Plague Reaper... he won't leave anyone alive...'</p><br><p>"Erla! Great job!" Lero exclaimed with an excited smile.</p><br><p>But... Osnana and Katrin didn't have the same enthusiasm as these two.</p><br><p>"Shit... Besides being physically strong and being able to kill with his breath alone, his coat is a living weapon? What the hell is going on here?" Katrin frowned heavily while gritting her teeth. Then, she cast another glance at the Scarlet Pyromancer lurking above.</p><br><br><p>"Yeah... Furthermore, we still don't know what's in there." Osana said, pointing at the heavy coffin next to Fume Throne.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper had come to Fume Cathedral carrying that coffin on his back, but since he had dropped it on the floor as a heavy load, he had yet to touch his secret weapon once.</p><br><p>"Alright. Now that we've lost Oskar, you'll have to get your act together." Osana said confidently with a glance at Adam and Erla.</p><br><p>Erla and Adam glanced at each other.</p><br><p>"Attack together, as quickly and aggressively as possible. I, Lero, and Katrin will assist you. We can't boost you anymore, but... even though we're the supports, we each have at least one attack ability." Osana stretched her hand forward as her eyes shone brightly.</p><br><p>Osana had already used two of the four abilities that any K1-Phantom had, so she only had two left in her arsenal, one of which was her First Order. It was an ability she had used since the beginning of her journey.</p><br><p>It didn't matter if the Phantom was someone like Adam or Oskar, whose abilities were centered around killing enemies and dealing damage, any Phantom had to have the ability to defend themselves.</p><br><p>Katrin was an obvious example, though her two Nexus Traits were focused on helping and strengthening others, her First Order summoned a lot of roots with sharp spikes. Sure, most of the time she used roots to immobilize a target, but she could pierce some monster with sharp roots.</p><br><p>Osana was in a similar situation.</p><br><br><p>A pink-blue mist appeared in front of her palm, slowly rotating in front of her hand like a serene vortex.</p><br><p>Then, a stream of petals came out, some of them were blue, with sharp edges and elongated shapes like blades, and the pink petals were round and soft.</p><br><p>As Osana waved her hand, the pink petals came towards Adam, Erla, Lero, and Katrin, hovering near them and perched on their shoulders like miniature angels who were ready to heal their wounds if needed.</p><br><p>The blue petals soared upwards, aiming their sharp tips directly at Plague Reaper, who cast only a calm glance at Osana, assessing her ability.</p><br><p>"The pink petals can heal your wounds, but only pretty weak ones like scratches or light cuts, so don't count on them too much, it's only a bonus. The main strength of my skill is in the blue petals." Osana said confidently before dramatically lowering her palm down.</p><br><p>Dozens of petals rained down on Plague Reaper like a hail of blades.</p><br><p>Although it was only Osana's First Order, given her energy level, the petals were strong enough to wound Plague Reaper or even seriously injure him if any petal sliced his neck or tendon.</p><br><p>Plague Reaper glared at her, perceiving her as a worthy threat, but, he didn't even bother to dodge.</p><br><br><p>Instead of trying to avoid the damage, Plague Reaper swung his coat, completely covering the space in front of him.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle. </p><br><p>The blue petals crashed into Plague Reaper's coat and bounced off as if from a steel wall that they were unable to overcome.</p><br><p>However, only a sly smile appeared on Osana's face.</p><br><p>'Good. As I thought, he is quite vulnerable and mortal. However... I shouldn't ignore the fact that he easily defeated Oskar and ripped off his arm. If we make even one mistake, one of us will die, that's for sure. If that happens, then with a squad even smaller than the current one, we'll hardly be able to counter him.'</p><br><p>Osana pondered, biting her lip. This was the first time Adam and Katrin had seen such emotion on Osana's face.</p><br><p>'Oh, looks like now she's finally starting to reveal what she's actually capable of, right?' Adam internally muttered before nodding.</p><br><p>'Well, that's definitely good news. There's five of us now, but... if Erla and I can do this right, we'll put Plague Reaper in a difficult situation.'</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward, turning into a lightning flash.</p><br><p>He still didn't have all the information about their enemy, but what Adam knew was more than enough to believe in their victory.</p><br><p>"Erla, attack!" Osana said, realizing that Adam had sprung into action.</p><br><p>Erla nodded, as her eyes shone brightly. In her hand appeared a snow-white sphere of energy that was actively shaking.</p><br><p>She could use the sphere like that, but she could also channel it into her sniper rifle, into her Nexus, which she did in the next second.</p><br><p>The sphere entered the weapon, traveling down the sniper rifle in white lines before Erla pulled the trigger and fired a shot.</p><br><p>The projectile that flew out of the muzzle was larger than usual, and... after flying only a few meters, it split into dozens of faster and deadlier projectiles.</p><br><p>They shook vigorously, containing explosive power, as soon as they crashed into Plague Reaper, as he would be engulfed in a white flaming inferno.</p>
