            <br><p>'Is he dead...?' Silvana asked uncertainly, looking at the thick flowing blood from above.</p><br><p>In response, Adam narrowed his eyes as two amber flashes appeared behind the dust veil.</p><br><p>"I doubt it. He's surely wounded, but even very solid rocks aren't enough to kill him. He's too big and strong to fall from external damage."</p><br><p>"ROOOOOOAAAARRR!!!!"</p><br><p>A furious roar answered Silvana's question as a large shadow jumped out of the dust cloud. No more roars came from the Mighty Commander, he lost this game twice already and he wasn't going to be a fool anymore.</p><br><br><p>In an amber star, the Mighty Commander charged at Adam, but his speed wasn't even enough against Adam's usual reaction let alone the fact that his Second Order was now active.</p><br><br><p>Fully in control of the situation, Adam took a few steps back, moving out of the explosion's epicenter.</p><br><p>Sharp shards flew towards him, but he only had to tilt his shoulders slightly to dodge each one, no unnecessary movement.</p><br><p>"RRRRRRRRGGGGGHHH!!!"</p><br><p>A less bright but still irritated growl erupted from the Mighty Commander, meeting Adam's calm eyes.</p><br><p>His fingertips trembled slightly after the two gravity blows, but unlike when he first acquired this ability, his body was much sturdier now.</p><br><p>Moreover, the blows themselves were not only stronger but also had a less harsh recoil, not because the ability was better but because Adam mastered the Energy Control.</p><br><p>Thus, by channeling a large amount of energy into his arms during his punches, he made them stronger.</p><br><p>He wouldn't be able to use his Elemental Root's ability again anytime soon, but his hands were on full alert.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The two stone bracelets that were nothing more than heavy jewelry before now shone vibrantly, amber waves of energy like lightning passing through the cracks from one edge to the other to repeat their circle once more.</p><br><p>"And... What is that attribute?" Adam raised an eyebrow curiously looking at his opponent.</p><br><p>For obvious reasons, Adam expected every monster in the fortress to possess powerful flames, but so far that was only partially true.</p><br><p>'The Solitary Commander and the Dark Watchers take advantage of the Irregular Energy, but... it has nothing to do with Stone Mimics or Shadow Walkers.'</p><br><br><p>The Mighty Commander raised his paws high before he started pounding them on the ground like a madman.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide for a moment, at first he thought that the Mighty Commander wanted to cause an earthquake with his power, but... he soon realized that his opponent was not so simple.</p><br><p>Thrust. Thrust. Thrust.</p><br><p>One by one, stone spikes appeared all over the cave, above and below, left and right. Oddly enough, the peaks were not aimed at Adam, they grew in random places and had no sharp tips.</p><br><p>The peaks were quite large and dense, with blunt, regular edges. Amber straight lines of dense energy ran along each stone peak caused by the trembling.</p><br><p>"So... So earth, right? But..." Adam looked around slightly puzzled, "Why do you need all this?"</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, a shadow fell over Adam. Unlike last time, the Mighty Commander wasn't going to hesitate and was already attacking.</p><br><p>Adam didn't expect it, but he reacted in time and summoned the needle, cradling the weapon to his side.</p><br><br><p>A heavy fist slammed into the broad blade, throwing Adam upwards.</p><br><p>"Hmm? That wasn't as strong as I expected, though... considering all the damage was split along the threads and I blocked the strike it's no surprise."</p><br><p>Adam watched Mighty Commander closely, he expected the monster to jump and try to bring him to the ground with an overhead smash.</p><br><p>'Well, this is his best opportunity to take advantage of my helplessness in the air, but... If he decides to do that it would be a big mistake for him.'</p><br><p>A dangerous gleam traveled down the silver blade, ready to sink into the Mighty Commander's paw as soon as he made his move.</p><br><p>And... as Adam expected, the Mighty Commander jumped high up.</p><br><p>A confident smirk appeared on Adam's face, only to disappear the next second.</p><br><p>Discover more stories at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>The stone bracelets shuddered releasing a dense amber light like threads heading for the nearest stone peak.</p><br><p>Despite the fact that the Mighty Commander was in the air, due to his mass he should have hit the ground even sooner than Adam, but it didn't happen.</p><br><p>Instead, like a bright flash, the Mighty Commander found himself on the stone peak, gripping it tightly with all four limbs before leaping to the next one.</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" Adam's eyes went wide as a chill ran down his back.</p><br><p>Whoooosh. Whooosh. Whooosh.</p><br><p>The Mighty Commander zipped rapidly from one stone peak to the next, becoming faster and stronger with each leap.</p><br><p>His trajectory was complex and unpredictable, even with the Second Order in mind, it was hard for Adam to keep track and figure out what the Mighty Commander was going to do next.</p><br><p>'Fuck... If he's attacking me at this speed, then...'</p><br><br><p>Before Adam could finish his thought, two powerful legs slammed into his back, the ring of wind from the powerful momentum splitting apart as the massive muscles quivered.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Adam found himself in another part of the cave, plunging into a shallow layer of water with a high splash, yet it hardly softened his crash.</p><br><br><p>The Mighty Commander's satisfied laughter echoed through the cave as he landed on the round platform, grinning contentedly at his opponent.</p><br><p>A silhouette half hidden in the shadows slowly rose from the ground, trickles of blood streaming from Adam's head, running down his shoulder and the fingertips of his left hand.</p><br><p>If it wasn't for the layer of water, he would pass out from the violent blow to his head.</p><br><p>"You..." Adam bellowed angrily, "Are you satisfied?"</p><br><br><p>Enjoying Adam's state, the Mighty Commander joyfully slammed his paws on the ground with his tongue out.</p><br><p>Anger boiled inside Adam, but... casting a glance at the Mighty Commander experiencing innocent joy, something inside him changed.</p><br><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly shattering his needle into splinters.</p><br><p>"You're like a child... But you're too big, right? I have something to tame you."</p><br><p>At the same moment, the energy traveled to his hands, turning into three rings on his fingers, a single silver thread coming out of each.</p><br><p>"This is more than I can fully control, but... for against you, this will be a great weapon!"</p>
