            <br><p>Chapter 1087: Late One (Part 1)<br>
The Lords didn’t stand a chance, not after Saegar showed his true power.</p><br><p>More than ten Lords died at his hand in less than a minute. Some of their bloody bodies lay on the gray earth, and some were just a handful of ashes.</p><br><p>Many colorful fields had to disappear just as the sun was forced to hide behind a dense layer of clouds, making room for Saegar’s thunder.</p><br><p>After a few moments, Adam turned to Wilfred.</p><br><p>“What happens next?”</p><br><p>“Well, the First Star will lead us away from here. Then you’ll go through evolution and become a K4-Phantom. When all of that is complete, you and I are going to have a long and serious conversation.”</p><br><p>Then, Wilfred exhaled a puff of smoke.</p><br><p>“I thought you would come at the Lower Ring at the K1-Level or at most at the K2-Level, but you’ve been delayed, quite a bit. A lot has changed in that time, both in the Citadel and in you, hasn’t it?”</p><br><p>“Hmm? Going to the Lower Ring this early would be dangerous!”</p><br><p>Wilfred shook his head.</p><br><p>“I gave you the map for a reason. All you had to do was go down, and I would take care of you as a friend of the Dark Swan.”</p><br><p>Silvana frowned. ‘Adam, don’t let his pretty words fool you. It sounds like he’d recruit you. There’s no telling what he’ll say next.’</p><br><p>Adam didn’t answer anything. He didn’t want Wilfred to notice even a second of hesitation on his face, but it was clear from his gaze that he agreed with Silvana.</p><br><p>It wasn’t much different from his stance earlier, though.</p><br><p>‘Wilfred is a dangerous man. I only need him to get to the bottom of Aiden Henk’s head. He just saved my life, though. I’m grateful to him for that.’</p><br><p>“And…” Adam stammered. “You knew I was caught at the Dark Shore? You’ve been watching the whole time?”</p><br><p>Wilfred nodded weakly.</p><br><p>“Yeah, something like that. I was informed of the black flash incident. I knew right away what was going on. In a way, you’re lucky I was at the Dark Shore at the time as well. I have to admit, you held up pretty well. I thought you were going to lose to the stone flower in the beginning.”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br><p>He thought Wilfred had found him closer to the Lords’ arrival, but Wilfred saw everything from the beginning?</p><br><br><p>With a sweep of his spear, Saegar finished off the last Lord before closing his eyes.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Electric discharges headed towards him as his great wing trembled. Gradually, his raging energy returned to normal, and his Arc disappeared.</p><br><p>Wilfred shook off the ashes.</p><br><p>“Ask if you have any questions. I think we have a few more minutes until your Third Key absorbs the Twilight Crystal completely.”</p><br><p>“Sure.” Adam nodded.</p><br><p>He wanted to know both about the Lords and the weapons they used. At the Dark Shore, there were too many things Adam had no idea about.</p><br><p>At the same time, Kenward took a deep breath and walked slowly down to Saegar.</p><br><p>Everyone realized that the battle was over.</p><br><p>The Befallen Crown will not try to attack Saegar’s lands anytime soon. It is unlikely that the authorities will even do so unless a Phantom like Adam appears again.</p><br><br><p>With the wind rippling his coat, Kenward found himself next to Saegar.</p><br><br><p>Everything within a radius of two hundred meters was destroyed. The first flower fields showed only after three hundred meters.</p><br><p>“Well, it looks like you’re going to have a lot of work to do, doesn’t it?”</p><br><p>Saegar answered nothing, he only looked up to meet the first rays of sunlight breaking through the clouds.</p><br><p>He canceled his Lord Form, so it was time for the clouds to part.</p><br><p>“You know, I guess I should thank you for your hospitality,” Kenward said, pulling a small pouch from his pocket.</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Saegar raised an eyebrow, confused.</p><br><p>Kenward opened the pouch, revealing a single brightly colored seed that looked like a glowing dewdrop.</p><br><p>Holding his breath, Saegar froze in place.</p><br><p>“What do you say? Hah,” Kenward chuckled. “It’ll be a good start for your new garden. I know you. As soon as Adam and Wilfred are gone, you’ll start rebuilding your land right away, won’t you?”</p><br><p>Saegar smiled weakly, accepting the seed pouch.</p><br><p>“Thank you. I appreciate it. It’s not easy at all for you to give something like that as a gift. I know that.”</p><br><p>“Agh. Fifteen Lords. Eleven Lesser Ones and four of the Ascended Lords. So many strong fighters died without accomplishing anything.”</p><br><p>Saegar waved his hand carelessly. Their lives were worth nothing to him.</p><br><p>“They chose this path for themselves. The moment they chose to follow the orders of the Befallen Crown, they put themselves at risk.”</p><br><p>“Yeah, I guess you’re right.”</p><br><p>After a few moments of silence, a deep darkness appeared in the distance.</p><br><p>All eyes turned toward Adam and Wilfred when the huge snake’s frame shuddered.</p><br><p>The great creature turned into blobs of energy, disappearing into Wilfred’s inner space.</p><br><p>Streams of wind headed towards them. Their hair whipped upwards in free fall as the ground rapidly approached.</p><br><p>At last, Wilfred turned, giving Saegar and Kenward a slight nod.</p><br><p>Then, a flash of darkness burst from Adam, engulfing them both. They didn’t have time to reach the surface as they both disappeared in an unknown direction.</p><br><p>The story at the Dark Shore was over, but Kenward and Saegar knew that sooner or later they would run into Adam again.</p><br><p>“That young man. I’m sure he’ll become a Second Rank Phantom at some point,” Kenward said nonchalantly.</p><br><p>Saegar scratched the back of his head. “That could take a few years or even decades.”</p><br><p>“Hah, is that time for us? We haven’t even noticed how the years fly by.”</p><br><p>Saegar sighed heavily, for Kenward was right.</p><br><p>Long gone were the days when waiting meant something to them. The longer they lived the faster the days, months, and years went by.</p><br><p>They, as two True Lords, knew well how little time was worth in their lives.</p>
