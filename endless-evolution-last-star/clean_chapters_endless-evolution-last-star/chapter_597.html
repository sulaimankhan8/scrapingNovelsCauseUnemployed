            <br><p>Fromund and Adam were in different parts of the arena, and they both could only see the sweat of flames that filled most of it.</p><br><br><p>With a deep sigh, Fromund parted his hands, removing the fire veil. It took quite a bit of his Initial Order to create so much fire through his breath.</p><br><br><p>'Hah, it was worth it.' Fromund thought.</p><br><p>Keeping his hands on his knees like a tired fighter, he watched as his fire breath reached the border of the arena.</p><br><p>He didn't see Adam run out of the flaming cloud, which meant he had decided to take the blow for himself. At least that's what Fromund thought, it was the only logical conclusion for him.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>Silver flashes, one after another appeared on the other side of the arena, drawing Fromund's attention, his eyes quickly filled with bewilderment.</p><br><p>'What the hell...? Is he trying to extinguish my flames with his threads? That's a desperate solution, even if he's very fast, two threads aren't enough for that.'</p><br><p>Soon enough, Fromund was about to change his mind.</p><br><p>The white glow coming from the threads became more and more distinct throwing out clots of flames to the sides, weakening the flame flow.</p><br><p>'No... Something's wrong...'</p><br><p>Stay tuned to My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Fromund gulped, he realized that it shouldn't be like this.</p><br><p>'The fire should have burned him by now, the vivid pain and scorches would not allow him to continue his futile attempts.'</p><br><p>Then, his eyes went wide.</p><br><p>'Wait... Does he somehow destroy the flames before they can reach him?'</p><br><p>And... Fromund was exactly right, unwilling to believe his conclusion.</p><br><br><p>Enjoying the unique opportunity, Adam with an excited smile waved his arms in all directions.</p><br><p>As soon as the flame clots had a chance to reach Adam, a cascade of silver threads would turn them into nothing.</p><br><p>Adam used a lot of energy to create all his threads, but because of the situation he was in, he was using not much energy - all he had to do was wave his hands quickly and watch as the threads did all the work for him.</p><br><p>Thrust. Thrust. Thrust.</p><br><p>Like sharp blades dozens of threads swept through the flaming stream finally destroying it and their next target was Fromund.</p><br><p>He wanted to make sense of what had happened, but he had no time for that as the threads were ready to pierce him!</p><br><p>Realizing that there was nowhere to run, Fromund put his sword in front of him, hoping to hide behind the wide black blade.</p><br><br><p>The tips of the threads, one by one, crashed into their targets, shaking the ground with their power and speed.</p><br><p>All the viewers saw was a cascade of silver threads, hailing at Fromund like steel arrows ready to destroy everything beneath them.</p><br><p>Fromund gritted his teeth tightly, holding onto his sword, he was prepared to take as many wounds as was necessary to survive this round.</p><br><br><br><p>Hesitantly opening his eyes, Fromund looked around. He felt new flashes of pain on his body, but they were only a few shallow cuts, to him they were minor injuries.</p><br><br><p>The ground around Fromund was destroyed, cuts and small craters covered the surface of the arena, but hardly a single thread hit him.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>As if sensing that their deception was exposed, all threads simultaneously returned to Adam before quickly disappearing - only two threads remained, just like before.</p><br><p>"Well, well, looks like someone's having trouble controlling their own weapons?"</p><br><p>Fromund smirked contentedly, but... Adam's cold stare quickly removed that smile from his face.</p><br><p>"Yeah, so far I can only use two threads and so what? I managed to turn your fire breath into nothing. So now we're back where we started from!"</p><br><p>Without waiting for Fromund's reaction, not wanting to waste a single extra second, Adam rushed forward.</p><br><p>In a few quick leaps, he was right in front of Fromund, acting aggressively and fast.</p><br><p>Fromund had nothing left to do but to respond in kind, fighting against his threads, without success.</p><br><p>'Damn... I thought I could use my Initial Order to deal with his threads, but all I've accomplished is that we've both wasted a lot of energy.'</p><br><br><p>Blocking Adam's speed attacks, Fromund tried to think of what he should do.</p><br><p>'It's no good. I can't get into full defense anymore, and he won't let me use my Initial Order so freely again.'</p><br><br><p>The threads like whips flew in from the left, leaving two long, deep cuts on Fromund's right shoulder. Bright drops of blood rushed outward, pain traveled all over Fromund's body.</p><br><p>The wounds grew larger and larger, Adam's movements were relentless, he could easily overwhelm Fromund with a barrage of attacks.</p><br><p>'Fuck! I didn't even see them! Fromund, think! You have to do something! Maybe use the Elemental Root? No.</p><br><p>I don't have time for that and... it won't be able to destroy his threads!'</p><br><br><p>The threads crashed into his sides, leaving deep wounds near his ribs, the skin was thin so the threads almost reached his bones.</p><br><p>Gritting his teeth to not scream, Fromund stared intently at his opponent.</p><br><p>'I can't destroy his threads, then... maybe I have a way to weaken him? If he was a little slower and his attacks were not as accurate, I could fight him on equal terms...'</p><br><p>Then, Fromund noticed a slight, almost insignificant amber flash. His gaze instantly traveled to Adam's right eye, to his amber grid.</p><br><p>'Right... Once he used his Second Order, things got a lot more complicated.' Fromund thought.</p><br><p>'Great, now I know what to do and... I'm willing to pay any price for it!'</p><br><br><p>With no thought for his safety, accepting the consequences, Fromund stepped forward, straightening his right arm, holding his massive sword steady.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes flashed.</p><br><p>'Yes. He's made a mistake! I won't let him attack! You're too slow, Fromund!'</p><br><br><p>Before Fromund's sword could come down on Adam, two silver threads passed through his flesh and bone like sharp blades slicing his arm from his body.</p><br><p>A satisfied smirk instantly appeared on Adam's face, then... it was obscured by a fallen shadow.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes traveled forward only to see Fromund's wide open palm covered in flames from the red circle.</p><br><p>Before Adam could take a step, the flaming palm fell on the right side of his face, covering his eye with an amber grid.</p><br><p>Fromund frowned heavily, the red circle shuddering vigorously as the violent flames came out of his palm with all their power directly at Adam's face.</p>
