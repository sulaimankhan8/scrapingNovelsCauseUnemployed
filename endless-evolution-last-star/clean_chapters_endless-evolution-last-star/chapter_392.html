            <br><p>Citadel was a big city, with a population of millions of people living here, considering Upper Ring and Lower Ring, so people must have their celebrities.</p><br><p>People were inclined to follow someone, to give their likes to someone. Sure, the Citadel made movies, music, and various shows, it was an important part of the economy and a moral component for ordinary people.</p><br><p>But... given the world they lived in, no celebrity, idol or musician could compare to the popularity and recognition the Phantoms had.</p><br><p>The Phantoms hardly gave interviews, they didn't do movies or commercials, and they didn't participate in public events, but... none of it made any sense.</p><br><p>Most of the footage of NEPs during missions was available for anyone to view, the missions department rarely hid anything.</p><br><p>Few ordinary people were involved, but the media helped them. They picked the most outstanding fights and spread them as much as possible to gain views.</p><br><p>No star, idol, or musician could compare to the sight of one man, one Phantom, slaying hundreds of monsters fighting in the name of the Citadel.</p><br><p>So, then, who among all the Phantoms was the most famous?</p><br><p>Obviously, it was the one who held the title of the strongest, the protector of the Citadel, and one of the pillars on which their entire race was held up.</p><br><p>"Well, well, a little different hairstyle, hat, and strange clothing is more than enough to make you unrecognizable." Damien muttered taking a sip of his milkshake.</p><br><p>If he went out into the city in his normal clothes and disheveled hair, without a hat, he would hardly be able to walk even ten meters without being surrounded by hundreds of people.</p><br><p>People just didn't expect someone of Damien's caliber to walk down the street and buy himself a strawberry milkshake in strange clothes. Sometimes, changing a few details was enough to create the perfect disguise.</p><br><p>"Agh... Almost a thousand calories, right?" Damien smirked looking at the milkshake in his hands, "Hah, if she knew that to me that's like a drop trying to fill an entire ocean. Well, there's something more important right now..."</p><br><p>Damien glanced at Fort Norton, smirked, and disappeared.</p><br><br><br><p>The man walked through the spacious corridor, empty and secure. No ordinary person could enter here without special authorization.</p><br><p>In this part of Fort Norton, Phantoms underwent their evolution in spacious chambers.</p><br><p>Why did Damien come here?</p><br><p>Well, his purpose was obvious, he wanted to see what Adam was capable of. He wanted to satisfy his interest, nothing more and no one was able to stop him.</p><br><br><p>The mechanical door opened as Damien entered the room to find Douglas and Silvana's backs.</p><br><p>Silvana turned first. She tilted her head in confusion, not realizing who the man was or what he was doing there.</p><br><p>But... after a few seconds, she figured it out and her eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"Hello, what do you do?" Damien smiled, waving his hand like a tourist on the beach. He walked over to Douglas, taking another sip of his milkshake.</p><br><p>Douglas raised an eyebrow. They were well acquainted with Damien, but he didn't know why Damien came here.</p><br><p>"As I see I'm right on time, aren't I?" Damien smirked looking at Adam who was slowly rising from the ground.</p><br><p>He was trying to come to his senses after what happened. He didn't realize what that strange vortex was that looked like a large-scale version of his Revolve.</p><br><p>"Here, there's still half of it left." Damien said placing his milkshake in Silvana's hands, "Hope you like the strawberry flavor."</p><br><p>Silvana blinked a few times, dazed, and Damien was already approaching the exit.</p><br><p>"Wait!" Silvana exclaimed realizing that Damien was about to leave, "Give him some time to recover! His evolution was more extensive than he expected."</p><br><p>Damien waved his hand nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"Nah, I don't want to wait."</p><br><p>Then, he looked at Silvana over his shoulder with a kind smile on his face.</p><br><p>"You can always try to stop me, though. Who knows, you might even succeed."</p><br><p>Without waiting for an answer, Damien walked away, heading for the chamber.</p><br><p>Silvana's lips trembled as if she was muttering something to herself.</p><br><p>'Stop him...? Me...? It's impossible to even think of such a thing...' Silvana said to herself, clutching the milkshake tighter.</p><br><p>She realized that it didn't matter how Damien was dressed or how he acted. His power was at such a high level that a large part of humanity depended on whether he was or not.</p><br><p>"Agh... I don't think you need to worry." Douglas sighed heavily throwing a glance at Silvana, who was clearly not thrilled with the way the situation was unfolding.</p><br><p>"Hmm...?" Silvana gave him a questioning look.</p><br><p>Douglas scratched the back of his head.</p><br><p>"Damien may not look like a reliable man, but he sure knows what he's doing. If Adam is tough enough this fight will be a great test of his new abilities. In fact, I was thinking of offering him something like that myself."</p><br><p>"What? You wanted Adam to fight against Damien...? The difference in strength between them is too great!" Silvana exclaimed irritably.</p><br><p>Douglas raised his hand, with an open palm, as if stopping her panic.</p><br><p>"Calm down. I was going to offer him a fight against the Mid Yellow Threat monster, but... if Damien came here, there's nothing we can do but watch."</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Damien entered the chamber with a slight smile on his face. There was even more room here than in Fume Cathedral, considering that it was a square with wide walls and high ceilings.</p><br><p>For two Phantoms to set up a sparring match, it was more than suitable, but... usually during sparring, the two participants were at about the same level and this was not the case.</p><br><p>Compared to Damien, even K4-Phantom was weak and insignificant.</p><br><p>"Hello, how are you feeling?" Damien raised his hand, saying hello to Adam.</p><br><p>Damien didn't bother to take off his hat and tidy up his slicked-back hair when normally it was mussed and swaying in front of his emerald eyes.</p><br><p>Adam turned around, he like Douglas and Silvana had not at all expected to see Damien here.</p><br><p>Read new chapters at empire</p><br><p>"What...? What are you doing here?"</p><br><p>Damien looked up, touching his chin thoughtfully.</p><br><p>"Hmm... I guess I want to see what you're capable of, go ahead and show me your new abilities. I'll fight you."</p><br><br><p>"Wait... You'll fight at full strength?" Adam asked with a slight fear in his voice.</p><br><p>He had seen Damien fight once when Damien had rescued their squad from Desolate Forest, but Adam realized that Damien wasn't serious. To him, it was just entertainment, nothing more.</p><br><p>"Hahahahahahaha!" Damien laughed as if Adam had said something ridiculous and quite funny.</p><br><p>Then, Damien pointed to the side - to the observation room where Douglas and Silvana were looking at them through the sturdy protective glass.</p><br><p>"If I unleash my full power, Douglas will probably stand on his own two feet and not move an eyebrow, that old man's tougher than he looks."</p><br><p>Damien smirked before casting a glance at Silvana.</p><br><p>"But... your sweet Operator won't be able to take it. Her bones will break and her body will be under serious pressure, maybe she'll even die."</p><br><p>Adam's face darkened. He didn't want anything bad to happen to Silvana.</p><br><p>"Ah, don't worry. I want this fight to be interesting, so I'll just lower my power. You moved to the K2-Level, so I'll lower my strength to the lower limit of the K2."</p><br><p>Damien looked at Adam intently.</p><br><p>"And, as a bonus, I won't use my abilities."</p><br><p>Adam frowned heavily. It sounded like a humiliation to him.</p><br><br><p>Adam said confidently as his aura rose and energy filled his entire body.</p><br><p>His azure eyes were ready to shine brighter than ever.</p>
