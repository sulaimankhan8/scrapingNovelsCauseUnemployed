            <br><p>Barna, Sirgus, Mark, Katrin, and Kody stepped aside.</p><br><p>In fact, there was a special place on the sand walls for them where no Golden Searcher stood. It seemed the Prime King had long ago sensed Adam's aura and prepared for their fight.</p><br><p>"Now the most important moment has come..." Barna muttered with a serious expression.</p><br><p>"It's even a little sad that the success of our mission depends on only one Person in the end." Mark's gaze grew sadder.</p><br><p>Sirgus walked over to him and patted his shoulder.</p><br><p>"Don't worry about that. We've accomplished our task, now it's Adam's turn. Sure, we won't be able to handle Prime King, but this is a great opportunity to learn something. We all have great futures ahead of us, don't we?"</p><br><p>Mark smiled happily. He was the youngest in the squad while Sirgus was the oldest. Such words actually encouraged him.</p><br><p>Katrin sighed heavily. She wished she could be in Adam's shoes and be the main force of their squad, but she knew her capabilities and limits. The best thing she could do in this situation was to follow the fight closely.</p><br><p>Adam headed forward towards the center of the arena, he looked around then pointed at Prime King.</p><br><p>"Hey, how long do I have to wait for you? Come on, take your spear and fight me!" Adam exclaimed with an excited expression.</p><br><p>However, the Prime King was in no hurry to give in to Adam's temptation. Instead, the Prime King pointed at Adam, and the three Queens rose up, gazing at Adam as their only victim.</p><br><p>"Come on. Haven't you already tested our abilities? I don't want to fight them, I've already killed a Queen once, and I'm not going to waste my time on that!" Adam waved his hand.</p><br><p>However, the Prime King was not going to change his mind.</p><br><p>The Queens flapped their wings, heading straight for Adam.</p><br><p>'Cover your ears.' Silvana's calm voice echoed in everyone's ears. They knew what awaited them, so without further question, they did as she said.</p><br><p>Then, Adam shook his head and slapped the threads on his gloves against each other.</p><br><p>It was unlikely that the Prime King would suffer much damage from his First Trait, so that wasn't a mistake to use one of the abilities for it. After all, his Trait wasn't effective against a single strong opponent, and this way would save his energy.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Sonic ripples spread around, quickly reaching the Queens as well as the hundreds of Golden Searchers.</p><br><p>Golden Searchers grabbed their heads and fell to the ground, struggling to withstand this eerie pressure. If they were a little closer, their heads would definitely explode, all of them at once.</p><br><p>The queens were stronger, they were on a slightly different level. However, at that moment it didn't seem so.</p><br><p>They stopped, in torment. The Queens looked angrily at Adam, but they could not advance any further.</p><br><p>'Agh...? Was his Nexus that strong?' Katrin internally muttered in a confusion.</p><br><p>Her puzzlement was understandable, but easily explained.</p><br><p>Adam had yet to reveal the Second Trait of his gloves, however, that didn't mean that the First Trait was at the same level of power as before. His First Trait, First Melody: Soul Cry, had gotten much stronger after Adam revealed his Lock, and the same was true for his needle.</p><br><p>"Shit... If he wanted, he would have killed them all at once... This is so cool!" Kody exclaimed with an excited expression as an enthusiastic smile appeared on his face.</p><br><p>The Prime King shook his head, rose from his throne, and spread his majestic wings wide.</p><br><p>Slowly, his wings came into motion like massive plates capable of shifting an entire mountain.</p><br><p>A few flaps were enough to mercilessly throw the Kings away, they simply crashed into the walls. </p><br><p>Then, the Prime King stepped forward, pulling his spear out of the ground.</p><br><p>"Damn... If it wasn't for your wings and defense plates, you would be extremely similar to a Crown Type. Well, let's see what you can do!"</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Prime King stopped, but that didn't mean that their fight was canceled. In fact, right now, he was preparing to attack.</p><br><br><p>As fast as possible, the Prime King leaned forward and threw his spear at Adam.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils narrowed. He hadn't expected the first attack of the Prime King to be something so bold.</p><br><p>The Prime King had just lost his weapon!</p><br><p>Adam quickly jerked to the side, but there was still a long cut on his face. A few drops of blood trickled out, and in them, Adam saw his reflection as well as the spear, which, for some reason, shone brightly.</p><br><p>'No fucking way...' Adam inwardly muttered, shifting his gaze to the Prime King, whose hair shone in unison with the spear.</p><br><p>Then, as if fulfilling Adam's fear, the spear turned into a golden flash and was quickly in Prime King's hand.</p><br><p>"I see... So it's okay to not try to knock the weapon out of your hand. That's unfortunate, I was going to get rid of your spear, but it looks like that's impossible." Adam frowned, putting his hand out to the side and summoning the needle.</p><br><p>He didn't use any grip, he needed his needle free to block every attack of the Prime King.</p><br><p>Adam waited for the attack, however, the Prime King was inactive. He just pointed his spear at Adam and stared at him arrogantly, his eyes gradually filling with irritation.</p><br><p>'This is strange... Is this his way of telling me that it's my turn to attack?' Adam pondered.</p><br><p>Then a wide grin appeared on his face as an evil plan was just born in his mind.</p><br><p>"Hah, I didn't expect such consistency from a monster, this is even higher level than in a knight duel. Well, you asked for it yourself. I attack!" Adam exclaimed as he swung his hand tightly, clenching his fist.</p><br><p>Prime King tilted his head. The monster had expected Adam to rush into battle after such a speech, but the Prime King wasn't the only one. Barna, Katrin, and the others also did not understand what was happening.</p><br><p>However, Adam wasn't doing tricks. He was serious because he was already attacking.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Several electric shocks ran through Adam's fist.</p><br><p>In no time, a massive thunderbolt crashed down on Prime King, shaking the space and sending ripples through the air.</p><br><p>Instinctively, the Prime King realized that he needed to defend himself. He didn't even see the thunderbolt, he just didn't have time for it.</p><br><p>His massive wings moved again, covering him like a protective dome with the tip of a spear sticking out of the top.</p><br><p>Lightning struck the spear - as it was the tallest object in this small area. Powerful electrical discharges traveled all over the Prime King's body, heating it greatly. A few golden feathers began to melt, but due to the overall impact area, Prime King could withstand this attack quite successfully.</p><br><p>"I hate to sound arrogant, but you're not really the equal of a Crown Type, for you're much weaker."</p><br><p>Adam's calm voice rang out.</p><br><p>Then, five silver claws stabbed into the golden wing, passing through Prime King's defense.</p><br><p>Before the Prime King could realize anything, Adam clenched his claws around the monster's arm, tearing it off and tossing it aside.</p>
