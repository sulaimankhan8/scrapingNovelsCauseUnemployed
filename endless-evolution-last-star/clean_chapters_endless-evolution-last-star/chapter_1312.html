            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1312: Draug and old belief (Part 2)</strong></p><br><p>When there were several factions in one territory, there were always many disputes. Especially when all factions were roughly equal in strength and no one significantly dominated all the others.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, the Forgotten Mills was something of an exception in this matter.</p><br><p>There were only three factions, which was not very many. In many territories and even more so in regions such as the Tarnished Lands and the Dark Shore, there could be dozens of factions of varying strength and size arguing with each other over any issue.</p><br><p>Sure, none of them were equal to the Befallen Crown, the Free End, and the Renegades, but they could still have an impressive influence, at least on their own land.</p><br><p>At the Forgotten Mills, there was a complicated but stable balance based on the fact that the Gray Needle and the White Tread often agreed with each other on most issues, and the Black Cut opposed them.</p><br><p>But, since it was two against one, everything was usually decided after a few short discussions and concessions from each side.</p><br><p>However, there was one exception to this rule that brought significant changes to the Forgotten Mills time and time again, and no one could prevent it.</p><br><p>That exception now stood right in front of Draug.</p><br><p>“World Wipe?” He frowned. “What is there to talk about? The next seven years will be as calm and boring as usual.”</p><br><p>Norax smiled mysteriously, and his next words did not reflect the reason for it.</p><br><p>“You think so? I think it’s a great time for change, especially for a promising warrior like Ureyn. Accept it, Draug, you lost Ureyn. All I did was take advantage of an opportunity, just like you and Gareyna wanted to do.”</p><br><p>He glanced at Adam, who was sleeping peacefully next to Ureyn, unaware that a single blow from Draug could end their lives, and only Norax’s presence prevented that from happening.</p><br><p>“This Phantom opened up opportunities for all of us. You were just too greedy because, unlike you, I wanted to enjoy the fight and that’s all.”</p><br><p>With an irritated grunt, Draug waved his hand and turned away. With each step he took, the ground shook, showing that his actions did not reflect his opinion.</p><br><p>“Don’t think this is over, Norax. I’ll be watching this Phantom, Ureyn, and even that stupid Arachne!”</p><br><br><p>With a leap that raised a pillar of dust, Draug disappeared, ending up on a peak in the distance.</p><br><p>He left the windmill, and all the members of the three factions began to leave as well, and even some ordinary monsters who had managed to find a place for themselves here.</p><br><p>Norax looked at the man and the girl. He was about to say something when something suddenly interrupted him.</p><br><br><p>“Well, well, I didn’t think it would come to this,” Gareyna said, stopping in front of Ureyn, a slight sadness filling her gaze. “You know, I didn’t want it to end this way.”</p><br><p>Norax spread his arms. “What else did you expect? You deceived Ureyn, then you deceived this Phantom. You were afraid that this Arachne would hold him back and wanted to get rid of him, but you didn’t understand that it was Draug’s teachings that were the chains that prevented him from moving forward.</p><br><p>“You were even more mistaken than this stubborn old man. At least he sincerely believes in the power of his faction and those who walk the needle path. To be fair, he has several successful examples up his sleeve, including himself. Ureyn is just a different kind.”</p><br><p>Gently, Gareyna touched Ureyn’s shoulder and even looked at Nollura without contempt in her eyes.</p><br><p>“Hmm… Maybe now everything will be different. Not only because I understand what Ureyn needs, but also because this girl is no longer a useless Arachne, and for that, I have you to thank.”</p><br><p>Without further ado, Gareyna turned and left the battlefield.</p><br><p>“Hey.” Norax’s voice called out to her. “Since we’re already at this point, maybe you can answer why you care so much about Ureyn? He’s a talented warrior, but that doesn’t justify your attention to him, especially considering that you’re from different factions.”</p><br><p>In response, she just glanced at him once.</p><br><br><p>Then, she disappeared, returning to her mill. It was unknown whether she would meet with Ureyn when he awoke, but sooner or later, a conversation between them would have to happen.</p><br><br><p>A cold gust of wind reminded them that it was time to leave, for there was no one else left on the plain but them.</p><br><p>“Boss.” The man scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. “Really, why is Gareyna doing this?”</p><br><p>The girl crouched down, holding her knees. “I think she loves him… That’s the only explanation. Yes.” She nodded in confirmation of her own words. “There is no other option.”</p><br><p>“What?!” The man exclaimed in shock. “She’s several hundred years older than him! That can’t be. Although… Hehehe, maybe he even likes it?”</p><br><p>Norax raised an eyebrow as he looked at his two idiots.</p><br><p>“Guys, don’t you know that?”</p><br><p>They turned to him with questioning looks on their faces.</p><br><p>“Ureyn just looks like Gareyna’s younger brother who died long ago. A lot of time has passed, but her desire to help Ureyn become stronger is still there, although it doesn’t always work out for Ureyn’s benefit, as you can see.”</p><br><p>The man’s eyes widened in realization.</p><br><p>“Right! How did I not think of that!”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” The girl tilted her head, staring blankly at Norax. “Boss, does that contradict what I said? Even if they were real brother and sister, they could still…”</p><br><p>Norax touched his temple and shook his head.</p><br><p>‘Damn… Maybe old man Draug is right about something? Somehow, every decision in my life has led to these two being my top subordinates, and that’s definitely not going to lead to anything good. And, I like it!’</p><br><p>His eyes flashed as he pointed to the three sleeping youths.</p><br><p>“Alright, Karso, Misty, take them away. We have a lot of work ahead of us!”</p>
