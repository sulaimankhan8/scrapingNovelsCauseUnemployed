            <br><br><p>Adam uncertainly pointed to himself. He was puzzled, not fully understanding the meaning of Osana's words.</p><br><p>"Sure, it's unknown how you'll prove yourself as a K2-Phantom, but... recently you were one of the strongest K1-Phantoms. You defeated Top-2 and Top-1 monsters. The Thunder Demon and the Plague Reaper, not to mention the many other difficult battles you survived."</p><br><p>Osana expected to see a smile on Adam's face at her praise, her words were sincere, and she actually thought so.</p><br><p>However, Adam just shrugged with a bored look.</p><br><p>"Nah, I'm not as strong as you say, no need to flatter me. I mean, I was better than most K1-Phantoms, but I wouldn't call myself one of the best. I didn't defeat the Essence Thunder Demon or the Plague Reaper by myself."</p><br><p>Osana blinked a few times, baffled by his answer.</p><br><p>"I had a lot of strong Phantoms helping me and every one of those fights was on the brink and not without casualties. I wouldn't be able to defeat any of them on my own at that point. Sure, I could have lasted one, maybe two minutes against the Plague Reaper, but then he would just cut me to pieces."</p><br><p>Before Osana could say anything, Adam waved his hand irritably, showing that this was an important topic to him.</p><br><p>"Come on, if it wasn't for your protective barrier, the Plague Reaper would have just needed to take one breath letting out his black air and that's it, we'd all be dead!"</p><br><p>Osana gulped, she realized that Adam was right.</p><br><p>But... even so, a lot of squads would die without a chance in a matter of minutes when encountering the Plague Reaper. It was an extra-class monster that was far too powerful for its threat level. Read new chapters at empire</p><br><p>"I see... Well, you're entitled to that opinion." Osana said quietly.</p><br><p>There was silence for a while before Adam cast a quick glance at her.</p><br><p>"So... What were we talking about? You said someone wants to marry you, right? You can't just say no? Maybe there are some ways?" Adam suggested.</p><br><p>Osana shook her head.</p><br><p>"If it was an ordinary nobleman, a Hallow Noble, or even a Light Noble, but the Artificial One, there wouldn't be a problem. I'm the Light Noble of the Rouzet Family, my status is very great and it's not affected in any way by the fact that I rarely act as a noblewoman and participate in my family's life."</p><br><p>Then, Osana's face darkened.</p><br><p>"However... this is a completely different situation. I became a Phantom a few years ago, I got the Spark, and I killed my first monster with the help of others, standard story for any Artificial Phantom."</p><br><p>Osana continued with a slight wave of her hand.</p><br><p>"I refused to join the Branch Squads, though my family members talked me into it since it was much safer that way, but there was nothing they could do against my refusal. Technically, except for some rare moments, I acted like a normal Phantom."</p><br><p>Throwing a glance at the table full of food they had barely touched, Osana muttered: "The only difference between me and the other Phantoms was that I didn't have to think about money. I have more than enough of it. As you realize, I was doing quite well, I was in many squads such as the Golden Light Squad, and winning dangerous battles."</p><br><p>Adam nodded deeply, understanding what she was getting at.</p><br><p>"So your fame as a Phantom has grown a bit. I've faced it as well."</p><br><p>A slight smile appeared on Osana's face.</p><br><p>"Yeah... but fame among the common people or other Phantoms didn't affect me much, but... I caught the attention of the Twelve Branches again. In a way, I became the pride of my family and a worthy noble who besides the bloodline can still fight and kill strong monsters."</p><br><p>Osana shook her head as she frowned heavily.</p><br><p>"Nirosh Marzo, it so happens that on one of the missions, the squad I was working with came to the aid of another squad that included Nirosh Marzo. Oddly enough, like me, he didn't want to be part of the Branch Squads, he didn't want to be guarded, he wanted to destroy monsters."</p><br><p>Adam shrugged. He realized that even if they were nobles, they were Phantoms first and foremost. Their job was to kill monsters and fight in the Dead Lands, not hide behind other Phantoms or spend their days in their families' lavish mansions.</p><br><p>Although Adam was not a nobleman and did not have their luxuries, he was quite sure that nothing could compare to a bloody fight on the brink of death against someone really strong like the Plague Reaper.</p><br><p>"Then..." Osana bit her lip, "We returned to the Citadel and parted ways. Apparently, Nirosh Marzo was interested in me back then, both as a woman and as a Phantom. Since our families know each other well and have a strong relationship, it wasn't long before he learned quite a bit about me."</p><br><p>Adam narrowed his eyes looking intently at Osana.</p><br><p>"So... Realizing that I was the Artificial Phantom and he was the Natural One, he came to my family and demanded to marry me. After that, the end of my quiet life came. This rule works among all Twelve Branches, and I simply can't refuse, ignore, or run away."</p><br><p>Osana spread her hands apart.</p><br><p>"If I resist, they'll just come to me, put me in a white dress and take me to the groom, then force me to give birth to an heir and more than one, since the chances of any of the children being Phantom in such a union are very high."</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head he felt a little sorry for Osana.</p><br><p>"Oh... That sucks..."</p><br><p>"Yeah, what's more, a wedding date has already been set, it will happen in a few months."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"What...? But..." Adam looked at his wedding ring as he showed his hand, "You did propose to me..."</p><br><br><p>"Sure, because I want you to possess me. I want you to use The Rule of Power."</p><br><p>Adam blinked a few times.</p><br><p>"The Rule of Power...?"</p>
