            <br><p>This time there were only three figures at the table - Adam, Silvana, and Reinz.</p><br><p>Chloe stayed behind to train with Erik and Julia.</p><br><p>Since they had completed the first stage of training, they had the opportunity to do whatever they wanted. Reinz expected a short fight to test their strength after training, but Adam suggested a simple conversation over pancakes.</p><br><p>"So..." Reinz muttered pouring honey on the pancakes, "You want to know more about my family? Why would you want that?"</p><br><p>Adam took a sip of his tea, he'd already had too much coffee today, and then he shrugged.</p><br><p>"I'm just curious. I'm sure you know about my fight at the Moon Colosseum and that Osana De Rouzet got me into that story. They're in charge at the third wing, but there must be a difference between her family and yours, right?"</p><br><p>"Hmm." Reinz mumbled thoughtfully, "I'm not quite sure what you want to hear. Sure, the Alderran Family has a lot of influence. As a Phantom from the first great family, I have privileges that ordinary people can't even dream of."</p><br><p>"But..." Adam interrupted him, "You weren't lucky enough to get the Spark, were you?"</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Reinz's face went dark. This caught Silvana's attention; she hadn't seen him so sullen before.</p><br><p>"Yeah... It's been a rough time..." Reinz scratched the back of his head awkwardly, "However, I'm not going to complain, after all, you were right."</p><br><br><p>"My family was ready to put a cross on me and forget about me, meaning I'd be a regular Hallow Noble - a common man. But, when I expressed my initiative to go to the Dead Lands to become a Natural Phantom, I received the best support possible.</p><br><p>"Weapons, harsh training that made everything before seem like child's play, selection of monster, scouting, all the necessary information, and much more."</p><br><p>It was obvious by Reinz that he was not proud of his accomplishment. Sure, even with all of the above, defeating a monster was a difficult task, but... he didn't want to talk about it much sitting in front of Adam.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Reinz felt someone's touch.</p><br><p>He turned around to see Silvana's deep eyes.</p><br><p>"You shouldn't underestimate your accomplishments. You're proud of yourself, and that's fine, but you're different from other nobles who are arrogant just because they were lucky enough to be born into a great family and get the Spark by huge odds."</p><br><p>Silvana gripped his wrist tighter as she glanced at Adam.</p><br><p>"Yeah... Adam wasn't so lucky, but you're both the Natural Phantoms. You've already reached a K3-Level, you can't do that without having desires and true abilities. The other nobles in your family have stayed at K1 and K2 levels for years, right?" she tilted her head with a slight smile.</p><br><p>"Well, I guess you're right." Reinz gulped.</p><br><p>Adam grinned widely, arms crossed over his chest, "Of course she's right. I'm proud of what I've done and you should be too. Not just of your origins and being a K3-Phantom, but of killing your first monster being a mere human!</p><br><p>"I'm sure it was a remarkable fight, for... hah," he shook his head with a dark chuckle, "I killed my first monster in wild fear, acting on instinct. It wasn't a fight, it was a carnage where I got lucky."</p><br><p>Reinz smiled embarrassedly, lowering his gaze, soon his lips quivering.</p><br><p>"Thank you... I appreciate it..."</p><br><p>Sure, Chloe as Reinz's Operator was doing her best to support her Phantom. However, hearing encouragement from a near stranger and closest ally was a very different thing.</p><br><p>Reinz didn't doubt Chloe's sincerity, but Adam was his adversary.</p><br><p>Sometimes, praise from an enemy was worth ten times more than praise from an ally. After all, an enemy would never lie in his praise.</p><br><p>Then, Adam took a deep breath, the corner of his eye glancing at Reinz.</p><br><p>"I see, you didn't want to be a Hallow Noble at all. Seems like a damn bad position for a nobleman, right?"</p><br><p>Reinz waved his hand, "Something like that. I mean, I have a fair amount of freedom now since I'm a K3-Phantom, but... if you're a nobleman from the Twelve Branches, your whole childhood is a load of crap!"</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide for a moment, she hadn't expected such a reaction from Reinz. Unlike her, Adam remained calm, he seemed to understand far better what his opponent was feeling.</p><br><p>"The weight of responsibility crushes you like a mountain, you know you're a high noble and you know that if you don't become a Phantom, you'll never be able to achieve the same things as your siblings. You'll forever be at the bottom of the family hierarchy."</p><br><p>With tightly clenched fists, Reinz gritted his teeth.</p><br><p>"But, even if you are a lig noble, it doesn't make your life any better. You've been learning etiquette since you were a kid, constantly going to meetings and socializing with people you don't want to see, hah... all to avoid dishonoring your family's name."</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, he was curious about something concerning this topic.</p><br><p>"Doesn't anyone try to resist? I mean, I don't believe there are no naughty ones among the children in noble families," he asked.</p><br><p>"Sure, they are, but only at first instance." Reinz nodded deeply, a bitter smile on his face, "The punishments for disgracing the family name are extremely severe. Once is enough for a child not to do it again. Then, you get a little older and start to realize how to act."</p><br><p>"Anyway..." he put his hands together, "Behind the power, money, and luxury, there are obligations and strict hierarchies. And... Sometimes when I think about it, I realize that it sucks for almost everyone."</p><br><p>"Hmm?" Silvana raised an eyebrow in confusion, "What do you mean? Don't take this the wrong way, but although the life of a high nobleman has its drawbacks, this life is much better than the rest of the people in the Citadel."</p><br><br><p>Reinz leaned back in his chair, his clear-as-crystal eyes directed upwards.</p><br><p>"Sure, I won't deny it, but when you're a high nobleman you don't know that money can be a problem at all. Until you get a little older you don't understand that money can run out or that something can be too expensive.</p><br><p>"For that reason, status and power are much more important to nobles. So, I was saying this - while you're a child you have almost no free time, just learning, following rules and endless banquets and so on."</p><br><p>With a slight hesitation, he waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Unless you've become a Phantom, you must give up your desires for a high position in the family. Your maximum is to attend important family events and then marry for a favorable deal and to strengthen the alliance."</p><br><p>Silvana leaned forward, "But, if you became a Phantom, a Light Noble, that's fine, isn't it? Especially if it's a Natural Phantom such as you."</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Reinz smiled bitterly.</p><br><p>"It depends, like I said, it sucks for almost everyone. Even if you became a Phantom, there is fierce competition between you and the other Light Nobles. However, even if you're the best among your family, you're compared to the other eleven families. And... even if you are the best in this case, the K2 and K3 Phantoms will always look down on you.</p><br><p>"And... although the situation becomes much better when you reach K3-Level, the competitive part doesn't go anywhere. Moreover, you're now a candidate for an elder, which means the responsibility is huge, but..."</p><br><p>Reinz shrugged nonchalantly.</p><br><p>"There are far fewer people who can influence me now. I'm still a long way from the level of family head or elder, but most of the journey is behind me."</p><br><br><p>Adam's voice suddenly rang out.</p><br><p>"I was wondering, the elders that came to your rescue, the three that wanted to kill me, they're a K4-Level, right?"</p><br><p>"Yes, but K4-Level is pretty complicated from what I know." Reinz stammered, "I mean, there's a huge difference in power between the Elders and the other K4-Phantoms since the Elders are on the border of the First Circle."</p><br><br><p>Silvana and Adam knew what that meant, but it was the first time they had heard it from anyone.</p><br><p>It couldn't help but bring a smile to Adam's face.</p><br><p>"So, yeah." Reinz sighed, "We're lucky Mr. Erik showed up. Otherwise, I doubt you would have managed to escape out of there alive."</p><br><p>Reinz thought their long conversation had come to an end, but as soon as he lifted his head he faced Adam's serious gaze.</p><br><p>"Ah...? Is something wrong?" he was confused.</p><br><p>"No, there's just something I'd like to know. You mentioned elders, but what about the head of the family? What level is the first great family head at?"</p><br><p>"Heh... this..." Reinz gulped, "I think that's obvious, don't you? I mean, if the elders are at the K4-Level, then the head is the Second Rank Phantom."</p><br><p>However, Adam was not satisfied with that answer. He understood it without Reinz having analyzed the power dynamic between Erik and the elders of the Alderran Family.</p><br><p>"Fine, I'll ask you another question."</p><br><p>Adam leaned forward, his blue eyes growing deeper.</p><br><p>"Who is stronger, the head of the first great family or Damien?"</p><br><p>"Hah... You want to know everything at once?" Reinz shuddered, "Alright, although I don't know everything, out of gratitude for you giving me a chance to express my feelings, I'll answer honestly."</p><br><p>Adam and Silvana held their breath.</p><br><p>"It is a dumb question. The head of my family couldn't defeat Damien, not only because Damien is the strongest in the Citadel, but also because of their difference in levels.</p><br><p>''A person like Damien...</p><br><p>''As far as I know, he stands one step higher. A step that the few Second Rank Phantoms that Citadel has want to take, but can't."</p>
