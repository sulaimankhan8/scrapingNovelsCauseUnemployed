            <br><p>Chapter 1081: Twilight Crystal (Part 1)<br>
In the blink of an eye, one Lesser Lord lost his life. Now there were only eleven from the reinforcements, some of whom looked much stronger than the others.</p><br><p>Two of the four strong ones disappeared from the ranks, going to Serra, who was struggling to survive the aftermath of Saegar’s attack.</p><br><p>Their abilities proved useful in healing her wounds, quickly mending her mangled back, and restoring her energy reserves.</p><br><p>Saegar saw everything, but he did not pursue them.</p><br><p>After all, there were eight Lords in front of him now, not counting the fact that Kenex and Horon stood in the distance and could still contribute to the battle.</p><br><p>In fact, of all the Lords, only one man died, a man whose head Saegar blasted in a single motion.</p><br><p>Now, he was in a rather difficult situation – 1 against 14 Lords, and not all of them were the Lesser Lords.</p><br><p>Was there a look of regret or acceptance of the defeat in Saegar’s eyes?</p><br><p>Of course not. Moreover, he knew that now, he wouldn’t have to deal with this mess alone.</p><br><br><p>Calm footsteps sounded from outside as the two Lords, healing the wounded Serra, turned around.</p><br><p>Kenward’s calm purple eyes met them, who, amid the bright sun, were a dark blur. His hat, heavy coat, and long scarf were still on, the heat in no way bothering him.</p><br><p>Once Kenward was on the ruined island, the two Lords were alert. The woman and man glanced over, ready to summon their Arcs or even use a special ability if necessary.</p><br><p>“Kenward… Have you decided to help him? Saegar isn’t even a follower of the Free End!” the man exclaimed.</p><br><p>His eyes ran over Serra before returning to the two Lords. Their auras were powerful. Each of them far surpassed Serra, but they were still lower than Kenward and Saegar.</p><br><p>The reason was that the two Lords in front of him were not the Lesser Lords like Serra, Kenex, and Horon, yet they were not the True Lords such as Saegar and Kenward.</p><br><p>“I see…” Kenward muttered as he glanced at the woman. “One Duke and one Regent. This time, the Befallen Crown proved to be serious, didn’t they?”</p><br><p>Serra’s eyes went wide when she heard the ranks of the two Lords who helped her. For Kenward to figure it out was no problem.</p><br><p>The Lesser Lords were divided into three ranks – the Baron, the Viscount, and the Earl.</p><br><p>But, after the Lesser Lords did not come, the True Lords did. Between the strongest and weakest Lords was an intermediate stage that logically continued the ranks of the Lesser Lords.</p><br><br><p>They, as well as the Lesser Lords, were divided into three ranks as well – the Marquis, the Duke, and the Regent.</p><br><p>It was the Regents who were the last rank before the big barrier, followed by the True Lords.</p><br><p>Obviously, the three Lesser Lords – Serra, Horon, and Kenex were not enough to defeat Saegar. This was not surprising since they were initially just bait, and their job was to buy time for the stronger Lords.</p><br><p>Four of the Ascended Lords and nine of the Lesser Lords were enough to defeat the True Lords.</p><br><p>Sometimes the number of opponents didn’t matter because the difference in power was too great, but this was not the case.</p><br><p>Kenward understood that.</p><br><p>That was why he decided to come down from the main island to take part in the battle.</p><br><p>It was unknown if he was doing it just for the dew trees or if he wanted to help Saegar as well, but now it was clear whose side he was on.</p><br><p>This was not good news for the Befallen Crown.</p><br><p>“Leave right now.” Kenward’s voice broke out. “This is your only opportunity to avoid a battle with me.”</p><br><p>The man and woman looked at each other.</p><br><p>They realized that this was a good opportunity to stay alive, but they didn’t have that choice.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, they both summoned their Arcs. Golden armor covered the man’s great body as the bow ended up in the woman’s hands.</p><br><p>“Call out your Arc and fight against us!” The man exclaimed with a fiery gaze.</p><br><p>In front of them was the True Lord, yet given their strength and numerical advantage, they believed they would win.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, unlike Saegar, who didn’t want to summon his Arc until he was attacked by a dozen Lords, Kenward didn’t fight back.</p><br><p>There was only one problem.</p><br><p>“You see, my Arc was summoned from the beginning.”</p><br><br><p>The two Lords received baffled faces.</p><br><p>Then, Kenward retreated to the edge of the island before soaring above the ground.</p><br><p>His scarf trembled as the darkness transformed into a proud horse, Kenward’s loyal ally and his weapon.</p><br><p>Once on the horse, Kenward stretched his arm out to the side, causing space to distort.</p><br><p>A great black sword engulfed in white flames appeared in his tight grip, sending ripples through the air with every energy surge.</p><br><p>“I think that will be enough for the two of you. I don’t know if the Befallen Crown will decide to send someone else to help you, but I doubt the other True Lords will want to get involved.”</p><br><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><br><p>Kenward moved forward slowly, with a distant look at the man and woman who took battle stances and prepared to attack.</p><br><p>“I don’t know if there’s hope in you yet. But you are making a big mistake continuing to fight, hoping to change things. All the rules were set long ago, you only need to follow them…”</p><br><p>The woman couldn’t stand the tension, she bit her lip and drew the bowstring of her bow to the limit. Soon, three purple arrows were ready to be launched.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Kenward’s horse shuddered, turning into a dark flash.</p><br><p>“No!” The man exclaimed, grabbing his partner’s wrist.</p><br><br><p>A stream of blood rushed from the woman’s shoulder, practically cutting her in two. If it wasn’t for the man who reacted in time, she would have been dead by now.</p><br><p>The bright light under the man’s palms quickly healed her wound, but it couldn’t take away the fear that appeared in her eyes.</p><br><p>She hardly noticed anything during Kenward’s rush, and it frightened her.</p>
