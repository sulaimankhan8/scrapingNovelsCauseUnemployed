            <br><p>Once again, there were more people at the table.</p><br><p>Erik wasn't lying, there was enough dessert for everyone.</p><br><p>"Mhm!!! Julia, this is incredible!" Chloe was in delight, "If you have a spare minute can you teach me?"</p><br><p>Julia lifted her chin arrogantly, her arms crossed over her chest, "Sure, it's not very difficult, but maybe you two will have trouble."</p><br><p>Ignoring her teasing, Chloe chuckled briefly and looked at Reinz.</p><br><p>"Though he doesn't want to admit it, my pretty Reinz loves sweets."</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, Reinz blushed in embarrassment.</p><br><p>"Don't say that! It's... Sweets should be in moderation!" Reinz pointed at her.</p><br><p>"Hehehehe." Chloe only giggled carefully covering her mouth with her palm.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Adam and Silvana remained more calm. They just ate and thought about the future, glancing at Chloe and Julia from time to time.</p><br><p>'Hmmm... So Chloe is Reinz's Operator?' Adam pondered, 'They fit together, and... Julia and Erik too. Although... Fuck, Julia's too weird. She's a bit like Alexia, except Alexia is a Phantom.'</p><br><br><p>Erik clapped his hands together, drawing attention to himself.</p><br><p>"Alright. You'll be staying here for the next seven days. My house is big enough for everyone, but please don't let anyone go on the top floor. That's my and Julia's private area."</p><br><p>"Yes, my husband is right! I hope they know what you're talking about." Julia smirked and threw her arm around Erik's shoulder.</p><br><p>Then, she put her fingers in a V-shape to her mouth and began to drive her tongue up and down.</p><br><p>Reinz and Chloe's faces turned red in an instant, it seemed like a little more and hot steam would come out of their ears.</p><br><br><p>Adam took a sip of coffee, 'Damn, she doesn't have an ounce of shame and Erik is totally fine with that. I swear, if they weren't Operator and Phantom, they wouldn't be together in a million worlds.'</p><br><p>Perhaps a week ago Silvana would have had the same reaction as Chloe and Reinz, but she only shook her head. Her expression remained unfazed as she took a short sip of coffee.</p><br><p>"Alright." Erik uttered, "In that case, let's not waste any time and move on to the battle."</p><br><p>Adam and Reinz glanced over as their eyes settled on Erik.</p><br><p>"We're going to fight against you?"</p><br><br><p>They were ready to fight. The only thing stopping them was that Silvana and Chloe were too close, it was dangerous for them.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Erik shook his head.</p><br><p>"No, you'll be fighting someone else." Erik jerked his head towards Julia.</p><br><p>Now it was all four of them who were confused.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam and Reinz didn't expect to beat Reinz. Obviously, even if they each had 100 clones, the difference in strength would be too great.</p><br><p>However, they didn't need it. In this case, Erik had to act as a teacher. They had to achieve the goal of opening the second lesser gates, not defeat the teacher.</p><br><br><p>"Khm..." Reinz coughed, "Forgive my distrust Mr. Erik, but isn't it dangerous? I mean, Julia is a common person, she's not a Phantom."</p><br><p>Chloe silently nodded several times.</p><br><p>In response, Erik only stood up, adjusted the collar of his shirt, and headed forward.</p><br><p>"Follow my lead. I hope I don't hear any more stupid questions like that, but I respect curiosity, so I'll answer you along the way."</p><br><br><p>The door opened as Erik withdrew. Imperceptibly, like a ghost, Julia was beside him, over his shoulder slyly glancing at Adam and Reinz.</p><br><br><br><p>A cascade of footsteps diverged down the long passageway, and soon the four silhouettes were in the elevator, slowly descending somewhere deep down.</p><br><p>"Adam and Reinz." Erik began, "You, as K3-Phantoms opening your first lesser gates, should have realized by now that Operators are not just people or informative assistants. It should have happened to you more than once.</p><br><p>"The shared sight, the ability to track, the option to change one of the abilities through Operator's Star, the energy enhancement, the special resonance, and even something unique like the pain transition. All of these are just a fraction of what the Operator of a truly powerful Phantom is capable of.</p><br><p>"Sure, neither Silvana nor Chloe would be able to give even K1-Phantom a decent fight, however, they don't need to."</p><br><br><p>A few passages later, they found themselves in an arena located beneath Erik's house that by the looks of it was of considerable size.</p><br><p>The arena was authentic, the walls were stone slabs with various carvings and instead of a hard platform, the floor was dusty earth with a thin layer of sand.</p><br><p>There were a few spectator seats on the upper level of the arena, but nothing large-scale, at most for twenty people on all sides.</p><br><br><p>Erik pushed Adam and Reinz forward.</p><br><p>"Go ahead, you two stay in the arena along with Julia."</p><br><p>Then, he looked at Silvana and Chloe.</p><br><p>"Girls, there are better places for us."</p><br><p>A moment later, Silvana, Chloe, and Erik were in the center spectator seats watching a puzzled Adam and Reinz. Julia stood opposite them, nothing but a confident smirk on her face.</p><br><p>In the shadow, Erik appeared in the center, as a black cane showed up in his hands.</p><br><p>"So here goes. The rules will be as follows: Adam and Reinz, you fight against Julia, 2 vs. 1. However!" Erik pointed his cane upwards, "You are forbidden from any communication, no words, no gestures, no discussion of the plan between breaks.</p><br><p>"The only thing you can do is work together acting solely on your instincts. After the first day, I will tell you what the second lesser gates are all about, today... today you will only be in pain."</p><br><br><p>"That doesn't sound good..."</p><br><p>Erik shrugged, finding himself standing next to Julia like a ghost.</p><br><p>"Because it's not, well... for the two of you."</p><br><p>As soon as his hand touched Julia's shoulder her aura intensified a dozen times. Erik disappeared, but for Julia that was only the beginning.</p><br><p>A complex symbol appeared in her eyes for a moment before disappearing giving way to the bloody armor covering her entire body like that of a sacrificial knight.</p><br><br><p>She slammed her fists against each other, sparks flying off to the sides and a crazed smile full of anticipation on her face.</p><br><p>"Attack, you... two cowardly bitches! I'm going to fuck you! Two of you at once!"</p>
