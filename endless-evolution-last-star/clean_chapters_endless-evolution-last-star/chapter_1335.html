            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1335: Path to Light (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>Adam expended all the energy he had to deliver a powerful blow that ultimately saved him, and it worked, perhaps even better than any of them could have hoped.</p><br><p>This move caused his Energy Axis to quickly realign, accelerating his already rapid progress.</p><br><p>Norax, who was watching from afar and had the most accurate sense of aura of anyone here, closed his eyes for a moment so that a vision would not interfere with his understanding of what was happening to Adam.</p><br><p>Amidst the darkness and the multitude of other auras that he deliberately ignored, a white flame with a slight golden tint shone brightly.</p><br><p>He didn’t need to see Adam’s body to understand that he was the source of this aura, because he could see his frame, which was more than enough.</p><br><p>‘I see. So he’s already reached his limit? He’s not 100% yet, but in time he’ll definitely reach that critical mark.’</p><br><p>The corners of Norax’s lips curved upward into a smirk that Misty noticed but didn’t comment on. For Narica, this momentary change in Norax’s facial expression went unnoticed.</p><br><p>‘Good, on the one hand, it’s bad that he got through it so quickly. At the Forgotten Mills, it became much more interesting after he appeared, but on the other hand… We’ll get access to the main show faster, won’t we?’</p><br><p>The mirrors reflected how Adam fell among the stone pillars right in the crimson mist.</p><br><p>Karso watched Adam’s silhouette disappear into the depths for a moment before realizing that he had to act, right now!</p><br><p>“Fuck! They’re going to tear him to pieces!” Karso exclaimed and lunged forward with such force that the pillar he was standing on broke in two.</p><br><p>Their fight was over, that was obvious to everyone, so Karso no longer had any reason to hold back his aura. In just a few seconds, his aura became several times more powerful as he plunged into the depths of the mist after Adam.</p><br><p>Misty’s bats circled above the crimson peaks, but did not dare to descend lower.</p><br><p>“Boss, that’s enough, right?” she asked.</p><br><p>Norax simply nodded.</p><br><p>“Yeah. I don’t think we’ll see anything else. Start preparing for Adam’s departure in the Silver Beacon. Hahaha! I can’t wait to see what happens this time!”</p><br><p>“Got it.” Misty waved her hand, calling her bats back and putting away the mirrors.</p><br><p>The battle was over, and there was nothing left for them to see, but Karso still had one task left: to save Adam.</p><br><br><p>He crossed the layer of mist and found himself in the middle of red spikes that covered most of the dark bottom.</p><br><p>He expected to see a multitude of monsters already surrounding Adam on all sides, wanting to devour him, but instead, he saw only a young man hovering above the ground.</p><br><p>There were many monsters around, but no one was rushing to attack Adam. They all pressed themselves to the ground or hid behind pillars, not wanting to get too close to him, like shadows before the bright sun.</p><br><p>“What the hell?” Karso gasped as he watched the strange scene. Only he had such a privilege.</p><br><p>Even though Adam’s eyes were closed and he was unconscious from exhaustion, the energy that flowed through his body in powerful streams prevented him from falling. As a result, he hovered above the ground without even knowing it.</p><br><p>With each passing second, his Energy Axis was rebuilding itself, quickly approaching the last few percent.</p><br><p>“Hah, I see. So that was enough for you?” Karso smiled bitterly. “I was hoping we’d have a few more rounds before you could fully recover, but it looks like this was the first and last fight.”</p><br><p>Then, Karso shrugged and leaped forward.</p><br><p>“Well, that’s fine, I guess. The boss has a job for you, so you need to be in top form for it!”</p><br><p>When Karso was next to Adam, he nodded deeply and threw Adam over his shoulder before bouncing off the air and emerging from the crimson mist.</p><br><p>Adam needed rest, so Karso carried him to his room in the Norax’s mill.</p><br><p>That should have been the end of it, and Silvana agreed. She was glad that Adam’s plan had worked and that he had even found a new technique for himself to some extent. However, now came the moment she disliked the most—she had to wait.</p><br><p>“Agh.” She sighed, leaning back in her chair. “Considering that this was the last breakthrough before the end, it will take him quite a long time to recover, right?”</p><br><p>Silvana shook her head and headed for the kitchen. She understood that now she would have to wait a whole week at best for Adam to recover, but most likely it would be two to three weeks.</p><br><p>Sure, Adam always did most of the work, all the fighting and challenges, because he was a Phantom, but that didn’t mean it was easy for Silvana to wait several weeks for him, alone and with no idea how he was feeling.</p><br><p>‘Well, it’s good that this isn’t my first time doing this. Although, before, when there was no connection between us at all, I was quite nervous. Now at least I feel like he’s okay,’ she mused, pouring coffee into a cup.</p><br><p>Suddenly, everything went dark as her legs buckled. Silvana’s eyes widened, but she didn’t have time to do anything.</p><br><p>Instead, she fell to the ground, unable even to grab the edge of the table.</p><br><p>She didn’t have to wait long for answers, because the next time she opened her eyes, she saw a bright light in front of her, mostly white and a little golden.</p><br><p>It was the first time Silvana had seen what the Energy Axis looked like, which both amazed and puzzled her.</p><br><p>However, unlike Adam, who saw the Energy Axis as endless threads stretching in different directions, Silvana had a different, more cohesive view.</p><br><p>Only the last part of the Energy Axis had threads pointing in different directions, while the rest was a straight, bright line along which energy flowed.</p><br><p>Silvana’s lips trembled.</p><br><p>“Why…? Why am I here?”</p>
