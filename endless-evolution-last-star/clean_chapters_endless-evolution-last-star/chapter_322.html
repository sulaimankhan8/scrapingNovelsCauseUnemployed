            <br><p>Adam and the others were able to accept the strange rules under which the Fume Statues operated. They were the guardians of the Fume Cathedral and were only supposed to let the worthy inside.</p><br><p>That was understandable. Those who were strong enough were able to pass through and hunt Adam and the rest of the Phantoms that tried to hide behind the majestic gates.</p><br><p>The Noisy Paroses managed to enter the gate line, and the Fume Statues let them through as worthy ones, but... as soon as one of them attacked the Phantoms, the Fume Armors activated.</p><br><p>Two knights in dark armor put their ebonite swords to the neck of the monster, who seemed to have broken some rule.</p><br><p>However, it didn't get any further than that. The Fume Armors did not really attack Noisy Paros and put their swords away, taking a few steps back.</p><br><p>Noisy Paros gulped. He didn't dare to do anything, and neither did the Phantoms.</p><br><p>Everyone looked at the two Fume Armors who were just standing in one place and doing nothing.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, another knight emerged from the shadows where the Fume Armors were hiding. However, that one was different from the two knights in dark armor.</p><br><p>His armor was snow-white, flowing and loose with abundant use of red cloth that ran down like a stream, partially covering the knight's tall body.</p><br><p>Before Adam could say anything, Silvana's voice sounded in his head.</p><br><p>'Adam, this is Fume Judge. It was because of his presence that Fume Armors stopped Noisy Paros, for he did not give his permission for this battle.' Silvana said seriously.</p><br><p>'Fuck... What the hell is going on here? Adam inwardly muttered with amazement looking at this scene.</p><br><p>In the hands of Fume Judge was an old-fashioned scale with two bowls.</p><br><p>Then, Fume Judge stepped forward, extending his hand and creating an energetic white field around Noisy Paroses and Golden Light Squad. All of them were inside that field.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, the scales tilted heavily to the left side, as if the left bowl was weighing more. This was the side where the Noisy Paroses were.</p><br><br><p>Fume Armors approached Noisy Paroses without entering the barrier and pointed their swords at the monsters to get out of the barrier.</p><br><p>At first, Noisy Paroses resisted obeying them, but Fume Armors didn't show any emotion. They just waited for the Noisy Paroses to obey their orders and gradually they succeeded.</p><br><p>First, one Noisy Paros came out of the barrier, then another, leaving seven more Noisy Paroses inside.</p><br><p>The Fume Judge glanced at the scales that were still out of balance and waved his hand, giving the Fume Armors an order.</p><br><p>Fume Armors nodded and forcefully pulled another Noisy Paros out of the barrier.</p><br><p>As the third of the nine Noisy Paroses left the barrier, the scales finally reached a balance. White flames burned brightly on the two bowls, and transparent walls rose up around the barrier, dense and virtually indestructible.</p><br><p>Then, everyone stepped aside, the Fume Armors taking the three Noisy Paroses away so they wouldn't disturb the others.</p><br><p>At the will of the Fume Judge, the barrier expanded to become several times larger, forming a veritable arena inside the Fume Cathedral.</p><br><p>The Noisy Paroses looked at each other in confusion, and Oskar, Katrin, and the others did the same.</p><br><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p><br><p>Adam tapped the barrier a few times with a thoughtful look as if testing its durability.</p><br><p>'Damn, I'm not sure I could even scratch it if I pierced it with my needle. Can't say I want to leave here, though.' Adam pondered before turning around and casting a glance at Noisy Paroses.</p><br><p>A smirk appeared on Adam's face. He didn't need any more explanations from Slivana, he now fully understood what was going on here and how this place worked.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, if he had to describe Fume Cathedral in one word, he would choose - justice.</p><br><p>Yeah, a place full of monsters and located in the Dead Lands, operated under strict rules.</p><br><p>The others had already realized what was going on here too.</p><br><p>"Hah, so 6 vs. 6, right?" Oskar smiled widely with excitement, "That's good, now I don't regret that we decided to run away here. This place is our lifeline out of this hell."</p><br><p>Then, Oskar glanced at Adam.</p><br><p>"Hey, how many of them can you kill with three enhancements?"</p><br><p>Not much time had passed between the time they got to Fallen Crypt and now. Adam was still boosted with three different abilities from Katrin, Osana, and Lero. He was at the peak of his powers.</p><br><p>"I don't know, but I'll try my best." Adam shrugged nonchalantly before summoning the needle, ready to lunge into battle.</p><br><p>"Wait!" Osana stopped him, "Don't rush. We can use these rules to buy time! We don't have to kill them, we can seriously injure them and just wait, after all the barrier will protect us."</p><br><p>The others were surprised that Osana already had such a plan, but they nodded approvingly. If they were forced to follow these rules, they could benefit from it.</p><br><p>Fume Judge who clearly heard her tilted his head in confusion. It seemed that he hadn't expected Osana to figure out something like this so quickly.</p><br><p>Then, he stretched his hand forward and a white clock appeared above the barrier showing that they had only ten minutes to reveal the winner of their battle.</p><br><p>"Pfffft! You should have been even louder about it so everyone could hear us!" Katrin snorted irritably with a wave of her hand towards Osana.</p><br><p>Osana frowned but didn't bother to say anything. After all, their main concern right now was to survive and defeat the Noisy Paroses.</p><br><p>Adam took a deep breath.</p><br><p>"Alright, since we can quickly recover our strength with Katrin's help, I don't advise you to hold back, because I won't!" Adam exclaimed with a wide grin before using his artifact.</p><br><p>Electric shocks ran through his body, a lightning horn appeared at the left side of his head and his feet rose slightly off the ground.</p><br><p>Fume Judge watching this looked baffled at his scales, which were still in perfect balance.</p><br><p>It seemed that Fume Judge could not believe the challenge Noisy Paroses would have to face to survive in this lightning hell.</p><br><p>Osana was watching Fume Judge carefully, she was the only one who noticed the strange reaction of the Fume Judge.</p><br><p>'I see... So these scales can't understand the full strength of a particular creature. Most likely these scales judge a creature's strength by its aura, just like the Statues. That's good, it will give us an advantage as a squad with three of the supports. Moreover...'</p><br><p>Osana glared at Adam who leaned his body forward, preparing to dash.</p><br><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam turned into an electric flash finding himself next to the first Noisy Paros. </p><br><p>The monster hadn't expected Adam to be so fast, such a sharp attack took him by surprise, but he quickly regained his senses and raised his paws to bring them down on Adam like hammers.</p><br><p>"RRRRRRRRGGHHHH!!!!" Noisy Paros let out a loud sound, shaking the air.</p><br><br><p>A white needle plunged into the monster's jaw, easily traveling further and piercing its brain. The next thing Noisy Paros saw was electric shocks following the silver needle that came out of his head, forever plunging the monster into darkness.</p>
