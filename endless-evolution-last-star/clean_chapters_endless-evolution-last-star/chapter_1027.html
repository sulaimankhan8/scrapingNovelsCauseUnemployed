            <h4>Chapter 1027: Two Watchers</h4><br><p>Adam sensed that something was happening in his inner space, just like the fact that Silvana was there in her spectral form. For a moment he felt hot, as if he were in the center of a fire.
</p><br><p>But, he didn’t bother trying to find out what was going on, he would do that soon but not now.
</p><br><p>"Adam!" Risha exclaimed, lunging forward despite her wounds. "You did it!"
</p><br><p>Before he could react, Risha jumped at him, clutching tightly without restraining her strength.
</p><br><p>"H-Hey, I almost died! Stop pushing me so hard!" Adam snorted irritably but didn’t bother to toss her aside.
</p><br><p>Risha looked up at him, her eyes sparkling.
</p><br><p>"That was so awesome! Fuck! I want that same ability! You killed the S5-Monster in one attack! That’s... That’s incredible!"
</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head awkwardly. He couldn’t hide his joy at Risha’s praise, it was always nice. Moreover, he felt that way himself.
</p><br><p>This was the first time he knew almost nothing about his ability, he had followed Silvana’s actions and didn’t know what would happen next. For him, the effects of the Imaginary Cut were no less impressive than for everyone else.
</p><br><p>"Well, judging from your aura, I’m not the only one who had to become stronger to win, am I?"
</p><br><p>"Yes! I opened the fourth gate!" Risha exclaimed happily, she wanted Adam to notice. "Do you want me to show you my ability? It’s really cool! Not like yours, but... still cool!"
</p><br><p>He smiled awkwardly, not knowing what to answer.
</p><br><p>The endless stream of emotions and words from Risha was ready to drown Adam.
</p><br><p>He was in urgent need of rescue.
</p><br><br><p>Grita became his savior.
</p><br><p>"Risha, stop acting like a child. You are a warrior who defeated a great enemy! Act accordingly!"
</p><br><p>"I agree." Torz who was standing nearby nodded deeply. "Arnoth and Kreyna are defeated, you have accomplished a feat, but that doesn’t mean you aren’t injured. It is our duty to help you regain your strength!"
</p><br><p>Risha puffed up her cheeks. "Pffft! How boring!"
</p><br><p>Adam, in turn, sighed in relief and collapsed to the ground.
</p><br><p>He was now ready to face Wilfred.
</p><br><p>He only had one step left to take before the K4-Level - to create the final key, but he didn’t think it would be much of a problem.
</p><br><p>’Hopefully, I won’t need the queen’s help this time. Connecting the stars was torture!’
</p><br><p>Then, Adam’s eyelids grew heavier than ever.
</p><br><p>An overwhelming desire to sleep overcame him, forcing him to close his eyes tightly.
</p><br><p>The many voices around him became muffled, giving him the silence he craved. He did not go to inner space as he sometimes did, no, he simply fell asleep to gain strength to continue his journey.
</p><br><br><br><p>At about the same time, the door at the Red Tower opened, letting Hygon’s powerful frame in. Orel and Lorana were still at the table as well, waiting for news.
</p><br><p>"You’ve seen everything, haven’t you?" Hygon exclaimed in excitement, taking a can of beer from the table. "This guy is a marvel! Let’s recruit him! It won’t be two years before he’s one of the captains!"
</p><br><p>He took a refreshing sip.
</p><br><p>"Hah! He’s going to sit at that table and stare at your perpetual frown, Lorana!"
</p><br><p>Lorana raised an eyebrow. "Damn, time goes by and you’re still as stupid as you were. Do you think this is good news? That young man, a Light Phantom! He’s not one of us and he never will be!"
</p><br><p>After exchanging a few teases, Lorana and Hygon looked at Orel, waiting for his opinion. After all, he was the second person at the Red Bears, right after their head.
</p><br><p>"You’re definitely both right," he muttered in a low voice. "Adam is talented, and he won’t be joining our ranks. There’s nothing wrong with that. He’s getting to the level where it doesn’t matter where you’re from, whether you’re from the Lower Ring or the Upper Ring."
</p><br><p>Lorana and Hygon looked at each other. They knew what Orel was talking about.
</p><br><p>The Upper Ring and the Lower Ring were part of the same structure, the Citadel.
</p><br><p>For them, the K4-Phantoms on the edge of evolution, there were virtually no enemies at the Dead Lands, just as there were no enemies among the Citadel. If anyone had conflicts, it rarely resulted in deaths.
</p><br><p>Every K4-Phantom on the frontier of evolution, much less those who stood one step higher, were too valuable to the Citadel to lose even one of them.
</p><br><p>The Dark Shore and the Hollow Wave monsters. They were the only ones who could provide trouble to such powerful Phantoms.
</p><br><br><p>Orel narrowed his eyes, remembering the reason for Adam’s arrival.
</p><br><p>"Adam isn’t the only talented Phantom that has appeared in the last two decades. No one can stop progress. Among the thousands of Phantoms who have died, there are always a few hopeful ones left."
</p><br><p>He clenched his fists tightly, making his knuckles crack.
</p><br><p>"Yet, if Wilfred and all the strongest Phantoms keep an eye out for stellar talent, Aiden Henk only shows his interest in Adam. Why?"
</p><br><p>A tense silence hung in the room.
</p><br><p>Hardly even Wilfred had an answer to that question.
</p><br><p>Even though Aiden Henk was a simple man, a free scientist, even strong Phantoms like Orel, Lorana, and Hygon grew grim at the mention of his name.
</p><br><p>"Hopefully, the government won’t let anything bad happen to Adam. Besides, Damien seems to help him out from time to time, so... he’s safe." Lorana waved her hand.
</p><br><p>But, no one dared breathe a sigh of relief.
</p><br><br><p>The serpents, led by Torz and Grita, left the castle with Adam and Risha.
</p><br><p>They had a lot of work ahead of them, but first, they had to make sure Adam was alright.
</p><br><p>At the same time, in the farthest corner of the Fallen Ring Castle, one large purple eye opened. It dissolved into darkness, leaving a few feathers that soon disappeared without a trace.
</p><br><p>At the same time, a man in an exquisite suit answered the phone and nodded deeply.
</p><br><p>"Good." Gladius smiled slyly, turning his head to the man with wise amber eyes. "He did well, Aiden."</p>
