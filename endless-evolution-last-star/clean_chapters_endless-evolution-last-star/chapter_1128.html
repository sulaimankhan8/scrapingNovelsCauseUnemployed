            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1128: Crypt of the Ancient Soul</strong></p><br><p>Adam didn’t fully understand this because he took it for granted, but there were very few Phantoms like him who had absorbed both the Midnight Crystal and the Twilight Crystal. It was very rare that one altered part of the power gave such Phantoms an advantage.</p><br><p>In Adam’s case, it was the Foundation Artifact, which was still under the influence of dense, black energy and was inaccessible to Adam. Moreover, one of Silvana’s abilities, which had not even had time to appear, was in the same state.</p><br><p>His power would be able to help him later, but the energy could already affect the monsters now. Sure, Adam couldn’t control the other monsters or cause them more harm, but the fact that he had the energy of the First Star was significant to many.</p><br><p>Especially to those who considered the First Star to be the most important thing in this world, and it was practically sacred.</p><br><br><p>Dayra’s knees collapsed to the ground as the roots slowly released Adam’s wrists. Dayra’s eyes trembled as she watched the black aura that felt just like the black flash and the Twilight Crystal.</p><br><p>“You… Are you a monster? No… That’s impossible. Your aura is very different. You are human, but… Why did the First Star choose you?!”</p><br><p>It was unclear which of the many emotions was controlling Dayra at that moment. She was happy, in awe, angry, and very nervous. She felt cheated, that it was unfair.</p><br><p>“Well, you have to understand that my situation is different from the Flash Carrier I’m hunting in these lands. The First Star brought me to the Dark Shore through the black flash so that I could absorb the Midnight Crystal.”</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward until he stopped in front of Dayra.</p><br><p>“I earned this ‘privilege’ that almost killed me several times because I killed several other Flash Carriers before that. So…”</p><br><p>He leaned forward as his calm, blue eyes reflected her trembling expression.</p><br><p>“To some extent, I have a lot of experience with this.”</p><br><br><p>Dayra was too distracted by other factors to notice how the two sharp tips of the rods ended up right at her neck.</p><br><p>She felt her skin heating up from the intense heat of Adam’s weapon.</p><br><p>“What are you going to do? Are you going to show me where the Flash Carrier is, or should I kill you right here and now and go look for it myself?”</p><br><br><p>In reality, she had no choice. Moreover, she had no guarantee that Adam wouldn’t kill her after completing his mission, but it was the best option she had.</p><br><p>“Hah, of course, I’m not going to die here.” She grinned, standing up to look Adam in the eye. “I want to see that bastard Lyrod die. Tsk, for me, that will be an even greater reward than the Twilight Crystal!”</p><br><p>“Well, well… I thought only humans could hate each other so much, but it seems I was wrong.”</p><br><p>Dayra shook her head.</p><br><p>“It’s not about whether you’re a monster or a human.” She tapped her temple. “It’s all about consciousness. Once you start thinking, remembering all the details, immersing yourself in memories, and reflecting, there’s no turning back. You have to accept all the advantages and disadvantages of such a life.”</p><br><br><p>“Although, who am I telling this to? You humans have consciousness from an early age. You don’t need to go through a special process for that.”</p><br><br><p>Adam flicked her forehead hard enough to knock her back.</p><br><p>“Yeah, maybe, but I’d say it’s more of a problem than a blessing. If a monster has gone through Awakening, it means it deserves it and is ready to control its consciousness. What’s more, you gain an increase in energy and more freedom in your abilities as you begin to better understand how to control energy.”</p><br><p>Then, Douglas’s words echoed in Adam’s mind.</p><br><p>“Yeah, this is further proof that monsters are perfect beings. We humans become better by breaking down one wall after another, while monsters simply climb the ladder.”</p><br><p>“So, we have a deal?” Dayra asked, her fingers digging into the ground.</p><br><br><p>“Something like that. Take me to the Flash Carrier and don’t interfere with my mission. You see, I’m not the best Phantom. If I go on a mission, I’ll only do the bare minimum; let someone else take on the extra tasks.”</p><br><p>A slight smile spread across Dayra’s face as she nodded weakly.</p><br><br><p>Thus, they continued on their way, passing through several hills and squares similar to the one where Adam had previously fought.</p><br><p>From time to time, monsters wandered around them, some standing directly in their path, others peeking cautiously from behind ruined buildings, but no one dared to attack them.</p><br><p>This was not surprising, as Dayra was an Elder of the Corrosive Lakes, and all the monsters here knew her and what she was capable of. Sure, many were puzzled as to why she had joined forces with the Phantom, but they were not foolish enough to antagonize her because of it.</p><br><p>If Dayra and this Phantom decided to go against the Flash Carrier, everything would soon become clear. Dayra would either die in battle or gain a new place in this territory.</p><br><p>After two hours, their journey took quite a long time, and they stopped.</p><br><p>“Damn, this place is huge!” Adam waved his hand, looking around.</p><br><p>They stood on one of the highest hills, getting a full view of the surroundings.</p><br><p>Dayra chuckled mockingly.</p><br><p>“Hah, the Corrosive Lakes is one of the smallest territories in the Tarnished Lands. After all, this area doesn’t even have a Lord, only a Flash Carrier who aspires to that status.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded, and then he glared ahead.</p><br><p>In the distance was something special, a solid structure that, unlike the ruins, had its own special aura.</p><br><p>Green flames burned from the stone pillars around the ancient crypt as the tall gates were tightly closed.</p><br><p>“Let me guess. The black flash happened here?”</p><br><br><p>“Deep below is Lyrod. He woke up earlier than he should have and hasn’t absorbed all the energy yet. Although, you know that already.”</p><br><br><p>“Alright. Enough searching, it’s time to get down to business!”</p>
