            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1320: Unbeatable Game</strong></p><br><p>What did ordinary people expect to see when they encountered a monster with great power?</p><br><p>Perhaps some kind of terrifying beast, or a majestic lord towering over hundreds of monsters and ruling them with his power and cruel grip.</p><br><p>But reality was sometimes very different from the imagination of millions of people, and only a few had the opportunity to encounter it.</p><br><p>For example, like now.</p><br><p>Adam didn’t know what to expect from Norax’s room, which was located at the top of his unimaginably huge mill, but anything but this.</p><br><p>Norax, like an ordinary human boy, did not spend his time thinking about greatness or planning strategies to conquer the world or expand his territory. No, instead he played some kind of video game and lost over and over again.</p><br><p>“Hey, Adam, come here.” Norax waved his hand, beckoning him over. “Narica, bring us some tea and cookies, the chocolate ones!”</p><br><p>Unlike Adam, who still didn’t realize what situation he was in, Narica reacted without delay.</p><br><p>She folded her hands on her skirt and bowed low.</p><br><p>“Sure, sir. I’ll carry out your order right away.”</p><br><p>As soon as Narica left, Norax patted the spot next to him.</p><br><p>“Come on, Adam, don’t keep me waiting any longer.”</p><br><p>Adam nodded slightly and approached Norax, sitting down next to him with his legs crossed.</p><br><p>Norax handed him a second gamepad while selecting a suitable game for the two of them.</p><br><p>“This… Is this really just a normal screen and video games?” Adam asked, still not understanding why these things, common to any electronics store in the Citadel, were here in the Tarnished Lands.</p><br><p>Moreover, how did it all work?</p><br><p>“Of course!” Norax exclaimed as he stopped at a fighting game unfamiliar to Adam. “Choose your character. If you have any questions, ask!”</p><br><p>Adam gulped, looking through one unusual character after another before settling on a man in a long coat and two swords. Norax, as the more experienced player, chose a cute girl in a wide dress and a large pink umbrella.</p><br><p>Obviously, after this choice, Adam simply had no chance of winning, he just didn’t know it yet.</p><br><p>Some people spent their time on quite useful things, as Misty did with cooking, but in this world, there were monsters like Norax who didn’t mind doing something like this and saw no problem with it.</p><br><p>“Yeah, I have a lot of questions. How does all this work? I know that monsters can replace quite a lot of technologies that require electricity with energy, but… I doubt that’s the case here.”</p><br><p>Adam understood that without electricity, it was impossible to make the console work. Moreover, the screen in front of which they sat was huge and had excellent colors and low latency, Adam felt it immediately. Even Silvana’s screens and PC were not capable of anything like this.</p><br><p>In response, Norax waved his hand, indicating that it was easy for him to answer Adam’s question.</p><br><p>“Nothing special, I just have a generator that can convert energy from resources into electricity, the same kind you use in the Citadel. As for everything else.” He shrugged. “I just bought it, I won’t hide it. And it was expensive! Very expensive!”</p><br><p>“You bought it? But…” Adam stammered, not understanding how that was possible.</p><br><p>If a monster like Norax ended up in the Citadel, it would pose a major threat to millions of people and plunge the cities into panic.</p><br><p>“Don’t be surprised, Adam. Do you really think that if I meet some Second Rank Phantom, we’ll attack each other like two wild beasts? That would definitely happen at a low level, between a K0 or K1 Phantom and some White Threat Monster, but not here.”</p><br><p>“Wait… But Misty didn’t use any kitchen appliances. Wouldn’t it have been easier for her to buy something in the Citadel like you did?” Adam asked, remembering how Misty had skillfully worked first with a coffee grinder and then mixed eggs and flour for dessert with a whisk.</p><br><p>Norax nodded slightly.</p><br><p>“She could have done that if she wanted to. I offered to help her with it, but she refused, wanting to remain authentic. Although I think it won’t be 100 years before she changes her mind, because electricity can do so much! Just look at this!” Norax exclaimed, actively pressing buttons on his gamepad, effortlessly destroying Adam’s character on the battlefield.</p><br><p>“I’m sure that if there were no energy in our world, electricity would be the main force. Although you humans have learned to use it to fight against weak monsters, which is already worth a lot, right?”</p><br><p>Adam wanted to ask something, but Norax interrupted him.</p><br><p>“However, you must understand, Adam, that I didn’t just come to the Citadel and walk into the nearest electronics store. People from the government did this for me.”</p><br><p>Until that moment, he hadn’t thought about how Norax got this big screen, generator, console, and so on.</p><br><p>He didn’t know what to make of it, but… government workers buying video games for a monster? It seemed more like a bad joke than the truth.</p><br><p>Still, Adam had no other explanation, at least for now.</p><br><p>“I’m afraid I can’t go into the details of how it works, but I’ll just say that at my level, almost everyone knows each other. Even if not directly, they’ve heard about someone from someone else, and so on.”</p><br><p>Adam scratched the back of his head, trying to understand what it all meant.</p><br><p>“So… you’re saying that you decided at some point that you wanted to try the video games and asked someone from the Citadel government or even one of the Second Rank Phantoms directly?”</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Norax simply nodded.</p><br><p>“Yep, something like that. What’s more, thanks to their help, I have a direct connection to the Citadel’s channels. You haven’t noticed it, but above my mill, high in the sky, there’s a satellite orbiting just for me.”</p><br><br><p>At that moment, Narica returned, carrying a tray with cups, a teapot, and several different desserts.</p><br><br><p>Another message covered the screen, but this time, Adam lost, and Norax enjoyed his victory.</p><br><p>“Yes! Let’s play another round!”</p>
