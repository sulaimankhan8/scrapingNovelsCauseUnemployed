            <br><p>Sometimes, the situation seemed hopeless, not always being able to run away or defend against an upcoming attack, obviously, Adam was in that position.</p><br><p>In a second, a laser would fly out of Thunder Demon's horns, blasting Adam into hundreds of pieces, and no one and nothing would be able to protect him.</p><br><p>Well, there were no secrets or cunning plans here, it was impossible to protect Adam, not even Prago was capable of it.</p><br><p>However... the danger was not in the attack itself, but in what would happen when it reached its target. To avoid damage from the attack, it was not necessary to block it, it was possible to dodge or make the attacker miss.</p><br><p>No matter how devastating the attack was, if it hit nothing, there would be no damage.</p><br><br><p>The bowstring flew off Fred's fingers with such speed and power that it left a deep cut, a really deep one, reaching down to the bone with blood pouring out heavily.</p><br><p>If this was the effect of the bowstring, what was the arrow capable of? Well, more than the average K1-Phantom could imagine.</p><br><p>To everyone watching the battle, it looked like the sudden appearance of a white star that, like a comet, traveled in a perfectly straight line from the ruins to Thunder Demon. It happened so fast that when people blinked, it was already over.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon's body was covered in goosebumps, perhaps for the first time in his life, feeling the white death approaching him, parting the air currents and leaving behind a trail of pale mist.</p><br><p>Instinctively, Thunder Demon stepped forward, or rather, he forced his body by any possible means to somehow move further, tilting his body, redistributing his balance, and relaxing.</p><br><p>But... He needed to be ten times faster to avoid the consequences completely, but probably his instincts had just kept him alive.</p><br><p>The mist arrow flew through Thunder Demon, completely severing his tail along with a large chunk of back flesh, revealing a wide bloody wound.</p><br><p>Plunging into the salt wasteland, the arrow traveled several meters, lifting the salt as high as if there was an explosion from a hundred kilograms of explosives, but it was a pure force of inertia and speed.</p><br><p>Whooooooooooooooooooosh.</p><br><p>In the next instant, Thunder Demon's horns gathered enough energy to fire a laser.</p><br><p>Despite Fred's best efforts, the laser headed straight for Adam, passing to the left of his head, over his shoulder.</p><br><p>Several electrical discharges from the fast-moving laser touched Adam's skin, only a few, but enough to tear his flesh as if from the sharp talons of a huge hawk, swift and deadly.</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide at the vivid pain, but it quickly faded into a blur as something more important happened - he survived.</p><br><p>Adam had seen what Thunder Demon had done to Dark Tyrant, the same thing would have happened to him, but Fred had saved him from that terrible fate. He had to seize this unique opportunity!</p><br><br><p>Landing on the ground, Adam glanced at Thunder Demon, his core had stopped shaking, and the monster was breathing heavily, trying to deal with the effects of the gruesome injury.</p><br><p>Fred, standing in the distance, smiled bitterly before collapsing to the ground. The world turned over in front of his eyes before remaining hazy and stopping at Adam, struggling to see what was happening on the battlefield.</p><br><p>"Well... The rest is on you... I did more than I should have... Hah, fucking much..." Fred whispered with the last of his strength, but there was a satisfied smirk on his face. He felt he had started the downfall of the Top-2 monster.</p><br><br><p>Adam rushed forward, quickly reaching Thunder Demon. However, Thunder Demon was not going to stand still and wait for Adam to kill him. They were both badly injured, but they could keep fighting.</p><br><p>"RAAGGGGGHHHHHH!!!" Thunder Demon roared aggressively, unleashing his four claws, his only remaining weapon on Adam.</p><br><p>Adam's pupils narrowed as he reached out to the side, summoning a silver needle and rushing into the fight.</p><br><p>Even given his abilities, Power Gene, and Naturalborn origins, Adam wasn't prepared to fight Thunder Demon in close combat directly, sharp strikes from the side yes, but not a prolonged combat.</p><br><p>However, now that Thunder Demon lost his tail, one hand and used up the energy reserve from his core, Adam was ready for it.</p><br><p>It was simple, Adam had no other option. If he didn't attack right away, Thunder Demon would head to the nearest artifact and recover. Adam couldn't let that happen, especially after what Fred had done for him.</p><br><p>Slash. Slash. Slash.</p><br><p>The silver needle collided with four long, sharp claws, each time causing a cascade of sparks to fly before Adam's eyes.</p><br><p>Adam had the advantage, he was slightly faster and more accurate, allowing him to leave scratches on Thunder Demon's body, one after another, but... he didn't have that much time.</p><br><p>'Just a little more...' Adam muttered, staring not at his opponent's attacks but somewhere else, a more important place.</p><br><p>Adam realized that it would take him forever, a luxury Adam didn't have. His physical stamina was much lower, so he was just waiting for the right moment.</p><br><br><p>Each of Thunder Demon's attacks forced Adam to take a few steps back or even a leap, otherwise the recoil would have broken his arm.</p><br><p>They moved across the battlefield like two flashes, one white and one blue, leaving a trail of dark blood behind them.</p><br><p>No one but them dared even move, they were the center of attention, and their fight seemed to be the only thing that mattered.</p><br><p>Everyone was watching the outcome with bated breath, and among them were not only the Phantoms on the battlefield but everyone watching from the Citadel or even the Bastions. Such an event could not help but attract wide attention.</p><br><p>'Adam, you need to hurry. He's getting faster and stronger, if you don't do it now, there might not be another chance.' Silvana said anxiously.</p><br><p>Adam exhaled a cold vapor before fending off another powerful attack, then another and another. It seemed as if he hadn't heard Silvana.</p><br><p>"Don't worry... I can already see myself killing him..." Adam whispered, looking serenely at the enraged Thunder Demon, it was the only thing he could see then.</p><br><br><p>Adam bent over, letting Thunder Demon's claws pass over him, then he lunged forward, leaving a wide bleeding cut on Thunder Demon's side.</p><br><p>Before Thunder Demon could turn around, the needle whizzed past him, bringing a silver thread closer to the monster's neck.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon's eyes grew wide as he realized what Adam was about to do. A little more, and his head would fly off his shoulders.</p><br><p>Without hesitation, Thunder Demon raised his arm, the one without a hand, letting the silver thread tie around it and easily cutting it down to shoulder level.</p><br><p>He had already accepted the loss of his arm, so Thunder Demon didn't even pay attention to it before he lunged at Adam.</p><br><p>Before Adam could retrieve his needle, Thunder Demon kicked him in the chest, digging deep into the flesh with his sharp claws.</p><br><p>The binding thread tightened, it was ready to tear, which would have resulted in the loss of the needle. For some reason, Adam couldn't let that happen, he needed the energy.</p><br><p>Adam jerked his arm sharply, forcing the needle back to him at high speed, while he was in flight from Thunder Demon's powerful kick.</p><br><br><p>Thunder Demon opened his jaw wide, and the next thing Adam saw was electricity-filled teeth snapping the thread, causing the needle to shatter into many pieces.</p><br><p>"Fuck..." Adam muttered before crashing into the salt hill, sinking deep inside it.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon glanced at the ground, where blue powder lay amongst the white salt - the tips from his teeth cut by Adam's thread.</p><br><p>"Rghaa..." Thunder Demon growled before leaping forward and digging his paw into the salt mound Adam was inside.</p><br><br><p>The shadow flew outward, dodging the deadly claws, but there was no escape, for a second later, Thunder Demon appeared in front of Adam, bringing his claws down from above.</p><br><p>Adam stepped aside, the claws passed right in front of him but left scratches on his chest, then Thunder Demon attacked again and again, each time coming close to doing serious damage to Adam.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>Adam tried to block the attacks with his gloves, with threads on them, but it was difficult and ineffective.</p><br><p>"ROOOOAAAAAAAAARRRR!"</p><br><p>Thunder Demon roared furiously, opening his maw wide and using his second and only remaining weapon, his sharp teeth and powerful jaw.</p><br><p>'ADAM! BEND!' Silvana screamed, realizing that Thunder Demon was about to devour Adam, one bite was enough to remove half of his body.</p><br><p>However... Adam didn't move away, his pupils narrowing as he took a step forward instead.</p><br><p>Thunder Demon's paw swept close to his face, claws leaving four deep cuts on his cheek as Adam's eyes began to glow brightly.</p><br><p>Soon Adam's eyes reflected the silver threads weaving around his left arm.</p><br><p>Adam took a step to his left, it seemed he wanted to dodge Thunder Demon's jaw, but given the distance, it was impossible.</p><br><br><p>At the same moment, Adam's entire right arm disappeared at the arrival of Thunder Demon's head, tearing Adam's arm off with a loud crunch of bones and a splash of blood.</p><br><p>A whirlwind of emotions swept through the soul of every observer that was reflected in their eyes, some were frightened, some were alarmed, and some couldn't believe what had happened.</p><br><p>Only a few, among the strongest, noticed that even though Adam's hand was engulfed in Thunder Demon's jaw, his eyes were calm.</p><br><br><p>Five silver claws, capable of piercing anything, thrust into the massive blue core, which cracked, breaking into several pieces, quickly losing its light.</p>
