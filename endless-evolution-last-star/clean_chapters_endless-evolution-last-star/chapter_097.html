            <br><p>"Two at once, right? Now I see what you were talking about. If I pass fire and lightning, I only have one zone left." Adam said with an excited smile.</p><br><p>To be honest, over the past four trials, Adam had missed the pure combat - the feeling he had experienced against Steel Knight or Brass Puppet.</p><br><p>Seeing the Lightning and Fire Prismatic Elementals attacking each other, Adam realized that in the dual-zone, he would definitely be able to satisfy his desire.</p><br><p>'Yes. However, you should be careful. The Lightning and Fire zone is usually the most aggressive. Well, you can see the reason for that yourself.' Silvana explained.</p><br><p>Adam nodded, then he looked around, seeing many other zones besides lightning and fire.</p><br><p>There were more than seven elements: water, fire, ice, lightning, wind, and earth were not the only ones. Combinations of other elements, their slightly altered versions, and completely different powers, such as the sound that Mirna used, were also considered separate elements.</p><br><p>It was too broad a spectrum of powers to be put into four, seven, or ten categories. The world, genes, monsters, and people were multifaceted, perhaps infinite, like a vast universe.</p><br><p>"Hey, which zone will be the last one?"</p><br><p>Silvana smiled slightly.</p><br><p>'Go through the fifth and sixth first. I won't reveal it to you for now. However, you won't be disappointed and get what you want. I can promise you that.'</p><br><p>"Tsk. Whatever you say. There's no point in thinking about it anyway. We have to deal with one obstacle first before we move on to the next, don't we?" Adam said confidently, stepping forward.</p><br><p>Soon, he felt the heat coming from the double zone, goosebumps went down his body, and his hair rose upwards due to the slight electrical shocks.</p><br><p>Even though he had gotten close enough, none of the Prismatic Elementals had paid attention to him yet.</p><br><p>Adam felt strange as if he was an extra here. The monsters were too busy fighting each other, and some intruder didn't interest them.</p><br><p>"Hey! I had high hopes for you!" Adam exclaimed.</p><br><p>Then, he frowned, clenching his fists tightly.</p><br><p>"Tsk. If you don't want to start first, I'll do it myself!"</p><br><p>Adam rushed forward, but before he could attack, a random strike from the Lightning Prismatic Elemental knocked him aside.</p><br><p>Adam wasn't the target of the Lightning Prismatic Elemental, he was just getting hit, and it was starting to really annoy him.</p><br><p>Then, he tried again and again, but it always ended up the same. The Lightning Elemental or Fire Elemental would just throw him aside, preventing him from joining the battle.</p><br><p>"What the hell...?" Adam muttered confusedly. He had expected a lot of things, but not this.</p><br><p>For the first time in his Phantom path, he was faced with monsters ignoring him, and didn't know what to do!</p><br><p>'Adam... Try to concentrate on something else. After all, you're not here to fight every monster you meet.' Silvana said calmly, reminding Adam of the challenge.</p><br><p>"Yeah, sure." Adam nodded slowly, looking around.</p><br><p>Then, he noticed that in the center was a special crystal composed of fire and lightning energy. Although dozens of monsters fighting each other in this area, they were bypassing the crystal.</p><br><p>It seemed that the crystal was their treasure, or they just couldn't reach it as their opponents prevented them from it.</p><br><p>Adam did not yet realize what challenge awaited him here, but one thing was obvious to him: if the Prismatic Elementals did not want to fight him, then he would set himself another target!</p><br><br><p>Instead of fighting the Prismatic Elementals, Adam decided that he could just sidestep them and take the crystal. He didn't know what would happen then, but he was sure it would somehow move him forward.</p><br><p>However, it wasn't as easy as he had expected. Even though the Prismatic Elementals didn't attack him directly, they kept him from passing as he was constantly getting hit by random attacks.</p><br><p>Sure, if Adam had used his abilities, he might easily cleared his path, but then he was unlikely to pass the challenge as needed for maximum effect.</p><br><p>"Alright, it looks like I won't be able to do it this way. In that case... I have to choose another plan, right?" Adam spent some time thinking before coming to one conclusion -</p><br><p>He had to proceed slowly and calculate his every move ahead.</p><br><p>Neither the Lightning nor Fire Prismatic Elementals were winning. In fact, their clashes repeated almost the same scenario time after time.</p><br><p>Adam shook his head and began the torturous and long work - the complete opposite of his expectations from this zone.</p><br><p>In the first hour, he could only pass the first row of monsters, the second row already took him three hours, and the cost of time only continued to grow.</p><br><p>Strangely enough, but the test of two of the most aggressive and active elements of the six encountered, turned out to be a patience challenge.</p><br><p>Adam realized that sooner or later, he would be able to reach the crystal, but every time he failed and had to start all over again, his irritation grew stronger, like a flame raging inside him.</p><br><p>Only after thirty-two hours, had he made any progress. He managed to sleep, regain his strength, and continue his routine. In over eight hours of sleep, no one had tried to attack him, he had realized this long ago, so he didn't even bother to find a safe place.</p><br><p>Step. Step. Step. Step.</p><br><p>Adam, with his hands in his pockets, approached the crystal, passing through all the monsters. From the outside, it looked like he could see the future and knew their every move, but in reality, it was the result of a hundred attempts and work on mistakes.</p><br><p>"Agh... Sometimes only by endless attempts can one achieve success, right? Well, even if it works, it's always nice to just get lucky." Adam muttered before bending down, about to pick up the crystal.</p><br><p>However, before he could do so, a change happened in his inner space and two new sprouts appeared: one purple like lightning and one red like flames.</p><br><p>[You have received your fifth Elemental Sprout!]</p><br><p>[You have received your sixth Elemental Sprout!]</p><br><p>Adam smiled happily as he clenched his fist with a satisfied smile on his face. Of all the trials, this was the hardest and most painful for him personally, because Elemental attacks were not weak.</p><br><p>"I can be proud of myself, right?" Adam asked, looking around at the fighting Prismatic Elementals.</p><br><p>He realized that he had no reason or desire to interrupt them because he was expecting a finale!</p><br><p>'Yes. You're almost done. I've sent you the coordinates for the last zone. Be careful, because I originally wanted to choose another zone for you, but Beth interfered with my plans. I agreed since I knew you would have done the same.' Silvana explained, and a message arrived on Adam's NEP.</p><br><p>"Sure. I've already been through too much to stop." Adam said confidently, leaving the double zone.</p><br><p>Soon, he arrived at the last zone, covered in a light purple mist, dark rocks, and iron pillars sticking out of the ground.</p><br><p>He hadn't seen a single Prismatic Elemental yet, but as soon as he approached this area, he felt a powerful pressure.</p><br><p>"What...?" Adam's eyes went wide as he dropped to one knee from shock.</p><br><p>His weight had increased several times because he was in a gravitational zone!</p>
