            <br><p>Piece by piece, the frost spear disappeared, shattering into black fragments, it fulfilled its mission and served as a disposable tool for the powerful creature.</p><br><p>The frost maiden could fight with this spear for a long time, she killed dozens or even hundreds of opponents on her way to her goal, on the path of evolution, and her weapon only grew stronger.</p><br><p>Yet, it could not fully withstand even one of the Crimson Monarch's attacks.</p><br><p>A wide crater surrounded the rest of the spear, streams of muddy water flowed over the edges, trying to fill the void, but it was only a call for the monsters - besides the bridge and the gate, they now had another way into the fortress.</p><br><p>More importantly, the monsters now determined who was their leader. Previously they supported the Dormant Lord, but the monsters in the fortress followed the Blind Sinner, as well as the frost ones protecting the ice towers.</p><br><p>With the Crimson Monarch's appearance, the balance of power changed greatly. The monsters realized that even if the battle between the Dormant Lord and the Blind Sinner never came to an end, on their side was the creature with the greatest power on the battlefield.</p><br><br><p>The Crimson Monarch let out a short sigh, watching the shattered frost spear with slight sadness.</p><br><p>"It was a worthy weapon, too bad it belonged to such a weak monster."</p><br><p>Then, he directed his gaze at the frost maiden, he didn't use aura or pressure, but the frost maiden sensed it in an instant. She didn't dare to ignore the Overlord Monster.</p><br><p>She froze in place, meeting the Crimson Monarch's calm bloody eyes.</p><br><p>A chill ran down her spine, her teeth began to chatter, she was scared to the core. The frost maiden realized that if this was the Crimson Monarch's will, she would die in the next second.</p><br><p>"Well, that's why I'm here, right? I have to follow my title, I have to make the weak into the strong and loyal."</p><br><p>At the same moment, the Crimson Monarch reached forward, pointing at the frost maiden.</p><br><p>A thunderous bolt descended from the heavens, crashing down with all its power upon the frost maiden. Her eyes went blank, she accepted her death, but... strangely enough, she felt pain, vivid and lingering, no such thing happened in instant death.</p><br><p>"AAAAARRRRRRRRRGGHHHH!!!"</p><br><p>The frost maiden groaned in agony, all the energy of the thunder bolt passing through her body, changing her very essence along with the endless waves of pain.</p><br><p>Her blue armor was filled with runes and changed its color to bloody. Her long white hair became much shorter and bright red, the same fate awaited her eyes.</p><br><p>Twitch. Twitch. Twitch.</p><br><p>Her limbs twisted at strange angles, electricity along with the Crimson Monarch's special energy flowed through her every muscle and tendon, giving her the ability to undergo evolution prematurely - in the scenario that the Crimson Monarch needed.</p><br><p>The frost maiden could have died during the forced evolution, she was in great pain, her heart was ready to explode at any moment of her weakness, but her will did not allow it to happen.</p><br><br><p>With eyes wide open, pupils fluttering, she collapsed to the ground in possession of her new appearance.</p><br><p>The change wasn't just external, her aura became much stronger, her instincts were trying to adjust to her new capabilities, the pace was wild.</p><br><p>For a moment, on her chest at the spot where the thunderbolt had struck, flashed the serpent seal, circling in an endless loop.</p><br><p>Then Crimson Monarch nodded deeply. He was satisfied with this scenario.</p><br><p>"You did a good job, many would give up before their time, the thunder would just tear them apart. But, there is one detail missing to complete it."</p><br><p>With a slight wave of his hand, the Crimson Monarch stopped the cut on his palm. He waited until enough blood flowed downward, floating in front of him like tiny planets.</p><br><p>"I took your weapon from you, no... I destroyed it, so I must replace what you lost."</p><br><br><p>With a snap of his fingers, the Crimson Monarch directed a clot of his blood towards the frost maiden. When she raised her head, the clot was already in front of her.</p><br><p>In a heartbeat, the Crimson Monarch's blood began to change its shape, following not his will, but the desires of the frost maiden.</p><br><p>Several times a second, the blood changed its shape to match the reflection in the frost maiden's eyes - she needed a weapon she could use to fulfill the Crimson Monarch's order in the best possible way.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch understood this, as a worthy ruler he knew that servants should be granted free will when necessary.</p><br><br><p>Soon, a massive spear slammed into the ground, it was much larger than the last spear of the frost maiden, its blade was as wide as a sword, a third of the length of the hilt.</p><br><p>"I see..." the Crimson Monarch nodded deeply, the wound on his palm had almost disappeared, "So you have always lacked wide and powerful slashes. Well, I've given you that opportunity."</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Following the Crimson Monarch's voice, the frost maiden slowly rose from the ground. Her legs trembled, the effects of evolution still lingering, but she used her spear as support.</p><br><p>She could feel the fearful glances of the Phantoms and the bemused stares of the monsters. Some of them were jealous of her new strength, and some wanted to know what she was capable of now.</p><br><p>Then, the frost maiden raised her head, looking up at the Crimson Monarch, he soared majestically at serpent spire level, his lone wing controlling the wind currents with precise sweeps.</p><br><p>The frost maiden gulped. She had already become his servant, there was no turning back. She was determined to fulfill the will of her ruler.</p><br><p>The Crimson Monarch sensed this, approval reflected in his gaze for a moment.</p><br><p>"Your first assignment is as follows - deliver Adam Vinter to me, make sure he is alive. All Phantoms in your path must be dead."</p><br><p>The moment his words reached her mind, the frost maiden's frame shuddered. In a red flash, she appeared in front of the man with the hammer, the first to notice Adam and the closest to him.</p><br><br><p>Before the man could realize anything, his head flew off his shoulders.</p><br><p>No emotion was reflected in the frost maiden's eyes, the man's comrades stood in her way, then she would bring Adam Vinter to her lord.</p><br><p>Now, she was his loyal servant, the first, but only one of many.</p>
