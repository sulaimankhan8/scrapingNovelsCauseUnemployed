            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1228: Dual Demon Sword</strong></p><br><p>Adam’s weapon had always been different from the weapons of other Phantoms; in this, he was unique and stood out from the crowd.</p><br><p>His needles were his main weapon, but not his Nexus. In the past, and especially now, his Nexus was something like his trump card, a weapon with great risk, but also great reward.</p><br><p>Many times, Adam wondered what weapon he would have if it weren’t for his needles. Obviously, Adam came to one choice—a sword. It was the most popular weapon among all warriors, and his needles were similar to it.</p><br><p>Now, he had the opportunity to touch this power, at least to make it part of his Evolution Tree.</p><br><br><p>A sword that holds the memory of two lightning demons you defeated in difficult, bloody, and painful battles. This sword reflects not only the victories of the past and present, but also how powerful your enemies could become in the future.</p><br><p>The power of lightning, speed and strength, darkness and light, two enemies, the past, present, and future. All of this now belongs to you if you decide to use the power of this weapon.</p><br><p>Immediately, Adam understood the essence of his new Foundation Artifact. He couldn’t hide his slight disappointment at having to give up his old artifact. It allowed him to fight as recklessly as possible.</p><br><p>‘But…’ Adam raised his gaze. ‘New power is always good. Lightning bolts, before the dark crown, had always been the basis of my artifact. Hah, it’s time to return to my roots, but in a stronger form, right?’</p><br><p>The Dual Demon Sword trembled as it returned to its socket on the Evolution Tree.</p><br><p>However, it was the first Star Rune, next to the Evolution Tree, the second Star Rune continued to hover, waiting for its moment.</p><br><p>Then, Adam realized one thing, remembering how the changes with the dark crown had occurred.</p><br><p>“Wait, it’s not going to…?” Adam’s eyes widened as he rushed forward to stop the second Star Rune.</p><br><p>He thought that, as with the Foundation Artifact, the Star Rune would try to destroy the Initial Order, or more precisely, what was hidden inside it.</p><br><p>Adam was worried about Lone Blaze, but there was no need.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Before taking action, the Star Rune released an energy field, covering a vast area of his inner space.</p><br><p>Then, calm streams of energy headed toward his Initial Gene, very different from how the first Star Rune had behaved.</p><br><p>Previously, it had been a destructive laser that acted radically to give Adam a new part of his power, but now it was a gentle invitation to someone who had long been an integral part of his inner space and abilities.</p><br><br><p>With a fiery flash, a figure in bright, amber-red robes appeared, heading toward Adam as a representative of the highest aristocracy.</p><br><p>It had been quite some time since their last meeting, and Lone Blaze had become an important part of his world, but lately, he had not needed her help as often as before.</p><br><p>“Greetings.” Lone Blaze smiled gently as she met his gaze. “It’s been a long time.”</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes were drawn to her hair, which now had many more silver strands among the red waves. Gradually, Lone Blaze changed under the influence of his energy, and the stronger he became, the more obvious the effect was.</p><br><p>It was a natural process, as his energy prevailed, unlike when they first met.</p><br><p>“Yeah… right. You look surprisingly calm. I mean, you saw what happened to my artifact, didn’t you?” Adam waved his hand awkwardly.</p><br><p>In response, Lone Blaze nodded and looked at the Star Rune.</p><br><p>“Sure, luckily, I’m not in danger of that fate. Besides the Evolution Tree, I’m the only conscious being in your inner space. Well, the Path Construct has consciousness in a sense, but it’s different from mine or the Evolution Tree’s.</p><br><p>“I know that changes will happen to the Initial Gene, and therefore to me, but I’m ready for it. It had to happen sooner or later, and I’m glad we’ve reached this point.”</p><br><p>A wave of relief washed over Adam; he hadn’t expected such a reaction from Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>“Hah, thank you, that’s encouraging.”</p><br><p>Lone Blaze’s lips curved into a smile.</p><br><p>“Sure. Now, let’s let the Path Construct do its work. After all, the First Grand Star is an important milestone, and there will be more to come, especially when you open the Constellation.”</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Adam looked at her, puzzled. “Do you know something about this?”</p><br><p>Usually, the Evolution Tree had much more information about trials and obstacles than Adam, but at the K4-Level, that was no longer the case.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze shook her head. “No, I just feel the energy much better. I understand that this will be a power of the same great level as the destruction of the Crystal Gates.”</p><br><p>Adam gulped. He knew what that meant as he turned to Silvana.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>At the same time, the Star Rune trembled, directing a dense energy ray into the Initial Gene and Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>His Initial Gene filled with a bright, snow-white light as something strange began to happen to Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>In several bursts, her flames burst forth, surrounding her, red and intense. But, gradually, her fire began to change color to white, becoming gentle and noble, but without losing its devastating power.</p><br><p>At that moment, Lone Blaze’s eyes became two bright fires, seeming to elevate her to the next level.</p><br><p>Her mouth opened slightly as the Star Rune shattered into many symbols that flowed toward Lone Blaze, filling her mind with information.</p><br><p>Adam watched in silence, assuming that the Path Construct was communicating with Lone Blaze. This was not far from the truth.</p><br><p>Unlike the dark crown, which the Path Construct simply chose to destroy because it was faster and more efficient, it had a different approach for Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>A few minutes later, Lone Blaze looked at Adam again as all her flames rushed forward, soaring in front of her and forming a great circle—Adam’s new power.</p>
