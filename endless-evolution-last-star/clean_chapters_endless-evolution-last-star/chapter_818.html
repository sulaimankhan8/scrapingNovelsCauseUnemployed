            <br><p>Adam reached out to the Evolution Tree, wanting to touch his Initial Gene. He felt like everything that was supposed to happen already did.</p><br><p>Turning around, he saw Moira and Lone Blaze beside him.</p><br><p>Their embodiments were not trapped in his Initial Gene like a prison, their energy was bound but not their minds.</p><br><br><p>Adam asked looking at Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>"Something like that. As expected, your Initial Gene and the Evolution Tree accepted Moira and me, no problems. However, I wouldn't advise you to try to use your Initial Gene right now. You're exhausted and you don't have much time."</p><br><p>Saying nothing, Adam nodded slightly and walked over to Lone Blaze. His hand fell on her shoulder, patting it a few times before he approached Moira.</p><br><p>He took a different approach to her - he mussed her hair, not shying away from being more assertive than necessary.</p><br><p>"Wait! Stop! Enough of this!"</p><br><p>Moira tried to throw his hand off her, but Adam didn't rest until he turned her hair into sheer chaos.</p><br><p>Then, he closed his eyes and disappeared from the inner space.</p><br><p>Lone Blaze slowly looked at her shoulder, a slight smile forming on her face.</p><br><p>At the same time, Moira was trying to tidy up her hair. Perhaps it was only her human form, but it was the shape she chose.</p><br><p>"Damn it! Why did he do that!!!?"</p><br><p>Her cheeks were puffed up, Moira seemed displeased.</p><br><p>"Now I have to put everything back in place! How am I even supposed to do that!!! I... I can't do it!"</p><br><p>Suddenly, Lone Blaze appeared behind her, gently grabbing her wrists.</p><br><p>"Hey! What the hell are you doing!?"</p><br><p>Moira exclaimed irritably.</p><br><p>"Get your hands off me! I have enough problems without you!"</p><br><p>Instead of the expected argument, Moira only heard a calm voice full of kindness:</p><br><p>"Hush, if you keep trying to get your hair back in a panic, you'll only make things worse. Let me help you. Together we'll get through this faster."</p><br><p>The first thing Moira wanted to do was run away, throw Lone Blaze off her, but... something made her change her mind.</p><br><p>In the end, she silently succumbed to Lone Blaze's influence, allowing her to help.</p><br><br><p>Slowly, Adam's eyelids lifted revealing his shining blue eyes. He was still in the caverns, the gray rubble in front of him the only thing left of the physical form of the Lone Blaze.</p><br><p>After a few seconds, he heard the Operator's voice. It was not the female voice he was used to, but a male one.</p><br><p>'Adam, can you hear me? It's Alan, the fighters are on their way. I don't know where you've disappeared to, but you need to get back to the fortress as soon as possible. Phantoms are gathering in front of the bridge.'</p><br><p>Shaking his head, Adam jumped high, exiting Lone Blaze's former chamber. In a few leaps, he made it to the exit.</p><br><p>Before Alan could contact him again, Adam appeared in the middle of the ruined fortress.</p><br><p>He looked up, watching several silhouettes in the dawn sky. Five fighters were heading in their direction, about to land not far from the gate.</p><br><p>"Well, well... Unfortunately we won't need all of them. Too many Phantoms died, though..."</p><br><p>Following his thoughts, he looked at the Phantoms waiting for the fighters, their eyes wide open and their smiles shining brightly in anticipation.</p><br><p>"After what we've been through, there's nothing more desirable than coming home. That's for sure."</p><br><p>Then, a confident voice came from outside:</p><br><p>"Hey, did you want to run away again? I think we've had enough trouble for today."</p><br><p>In a limp stride, Katrin approached him, not hiding her faint smirk.</p><br><p>"Damn, I want to get the fuck out of this place as soon as possible."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes lowered, scrutinizing her scythe.</p><br><p>"Why? This turned out to be the most effective mission for you. You've accomplished a lot in the fortress."</p><br><p>"Pffft. Are you kidding me?"</p><br><p>Katrin snorted in a mocking manner. She nodded towards the serpent lands, casting a glance along to the hills.</p><br><p>"I don't even know how many times I might die. Both because of my mistakes and your mission ended up here as well. The Crimson Monarch, the Overlord Type... It's not what I wanted."</p><br><p>Then, she stared to the west, looking far away for hundreds of meters.</p><br><p>"In the end... I didn't fulfill my goal. The Dormant Lord survived, I lost my battle against him in disgrace. Do you think I can find him if I come back here later?"</p><br><p>"I doubt it. Most likely he will not linger in his lair for long. He'll follow the fate of the Blind Commander."</p><br><p>Katrin gave him a questioning look:</p><br><br><p>Adam looked away, trying to guess where the Blind Sinner had gone.</p><br><p>"This battle, the deadly clash against the Crimson Monarch will not go unnoticed by them. They are like us evolving. If you ever run into this particular Dormant Lord, he won't be his old self anymore."</p><br><p>"Well, I'm not going to lose again. I've finally succeeded in taking a step forward, so I plan on catching up with you."</p><br><p>Then, her eyes narrowed, studying Adam's aura. In the blink of an eye, she felt Adam's aura become significantly more powerful.</p><br><p>'What the hell...?' she thought in disbelief, 'He just disappeared for a few minutes and... came back as if he...'</p><br><p>Katrin's pupils dilated, she realized that somehow Adam finished his Star Seal.</p><br><p>That meant only one thing - he was practically a K3-Phantom, while she needed to get two more stars to match him.</p><br><p>'No, it's not just that... His energy became different... It's not good, I'm behind again.'</p><br><p>Strangely enough, Katrin didn't give in to panic, no longer was she frantically trying to surpass Adam, she was assessing her strength. But, she was still annoyed by something.</p><br><p>'For every one mission he does, I do ten, no... more! In the end, he's the only one who successfully completed his mission today, everyone else failed including me. That's all that matters.'</p><br><br><p>The fighter's ramp lowered, bringing out several black-clad military men. Usually, the pilots were alone, but not this time.</p><br><p>The commander of the rescue squad, a man with rich blond hair, stepped forward. With a serious glare, he waved his hand:</p><br><p>"Phantoms split up and board the fighters. You survived - it's time to return home!"</p>
