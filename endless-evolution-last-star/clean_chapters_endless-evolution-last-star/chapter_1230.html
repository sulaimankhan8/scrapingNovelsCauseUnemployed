            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1230: Walk (Part 1)</strong></p><br><p>As always, after a great battle, changes followed. This was not the last battle Adam would have to fight if he wanted to stop the World Wipe, which would inevitably return the world to zero in seven years.</p><br><p>However, even Adam couldn’t be on the move forever. He needed a break from time to time, and now was just such a moment.</p><br><p>With a deep sigh, Adam opened his eyes, returning to the real world. He understood what the conditions were for the Second Grand Star. Two of them were known to him before, and only the Desire of Beyond remained a mystery to him.</p><br><p>But that wasn’t what he wanted to think about now. He would get to that in time, and preferably as soon as possible, because he didn’t know what awaited him after he created the Constellation.</p><br><br><p>Slowly, Adam approached Fromund and Marhen, who were waiting for him to finish everything. They watched from a distance, some out of curiosity, others to better understand how Adam’s power worked.</p><br><p>“So, until we meet again?” Adam turned to Marhen.</p><br><p>Marhen’s face became serious. “With all due respect, I hope not. Not in my current position. Though if I become Lord, who knows what the power dynamic in the world will be at that point.”</p><br><p>At that moment, there was confusion in Adam’s eyes. It seemed that Marhen knew a little more than Adam about the big world beyond the Befallen Crown.</p><br><p>“Ahem.” Marhen coughed. “Either way, I have to admit that this was the best outcome I could have hoped for, but I didn’t even see it coming. If you have no further questions, I’ll be on my way.”</p><br><p>Adam remained silent, understanding that it was time to part ways. He had no reason to fight Marhen, nor the desire or even the physical ability to do so.</p><br><p>After fulfilling all the conditions, he gained not only two new abilities but also a great surge of energy that made him significantly stronger. However, Adam was still severely exhausted, and his arm was as badly damaged as before.</p><br><p>Hearing nothing but silence in response, Marhen nodded weakly and turned to leave.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly, Fromund grabbed Marhen’s wrist.</p><br><p>“Hmm?” Marhen raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>“If you are not a lord when we next meet, I will be disappointed and will not fight you.”</p><br><p>“Hah, you know that doesn’t sound like a threat?”</p><br><p>Fromund grinned. “Sure, it’s not a threat to you, but to your pride. I think that’s the weakest spot for a monster.”</p><br><p>Marhen abruptly pulled his hand away and walked away.</p><br><p>“Pffft, just like an arrogant young man with muscles instead of brains!”</p><br><p>Fromund smiled faintly as he watched Marhen leave.</p><br><p>He had a long way to go to reach the Lord Level, and the two Twilight Crystals would be his first steps.</p><br><p>With a slight tremor in his legs, Fromund rose from the ground.</p><br><p>“Ready? Arayna is going to call a fighter to pick us up.”</p><br><p>Strangely, Adam shook his head.</p><br><br><p>Fromund’s eyes widened. He couldn’t believe what he had heard.</p><br><p>“W-What…? I’ve never heard of other Phantoms doing anything like that. What’s more…” He looked at Adam’s arm. “We’re wounded, we’re far from our peak.”</p><br><br><p>Adam stepped forward with a slight nod.</p><br><p>“Are you afraid? We’re heading for the Bastion Opard, not the border of the Dark Shore. There’s no one ahead who can harm us.”</p><br><p>It was Adam’s sincere desire. To do what he had never even thought of before, like most Phantoms.</p><br><p>And… he was right that they had nothing to worry about.</p><br><p>Either way, as long as they were on the surface and maintained contact with the Citadel within the Dead Lands, Frida could always protect them if necessary.</p><br><br><p>Adam continued to walk forward, leaving Fromund with only two choices: follow him or quickly return to Bastion Opard.</p><br><p>Naturally, Fromund had no intention of leaving Adam here alone and returning home by himself. That would be too boring.</p><br><p>“Damn it!” Fromund waved his hand in irritation and limped after Adam.</p><br><p>They were still in the Corrupted Volcano lands, passing through lava rivers and purple plants growing in harsh conditions, but when survival was at stake, everyone somehow found a way to adapt.</p><br><p>Arayna and Silvana contacted each other, not knowing what to do, as neither of them had expected Adam to do something like this.</p><br><p>What was the reason for Adam’s unusual desire?</p><br><br><p>He wanted to see the lands of the monsters at least once, not from a fighter jet or during a battle on a mission, but from their perspective.</p><br><p>“Hmm, in the end, it will all be destroyed, right? Just like the Citadel and…”</p><br><br><p>“Is something wrong?” Fromund glanced at him.</p><br><p>“No, just… We’re heading to the Bastion, but what will happen to them in seven years?”</p><br><p>Fromund blinked several times as he didn’t know the answer to that question. They both knew that only the First Ring would survive the World Wipe from the Citadel; only Queen Elisa’s barrier was capable of that.</p><br><p>But what about the Bastions? Each of them was a smaller version of the Citadel, some larger, some smaller, but on average, they were all built from the same blueprints.</p><br><p>Silvana and Arayna had the answer.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Arayna appeared next to Fromund in her spectral form. At first, she glared at Adam, as she wanted Fromund to return to the Citadel quickly and safely, but then she sighed.</p><br><p>She understood that it was too late to influence their decision.</p><br><p>“Bastions, they’re in the same situation as the Citadel.”</p><br><p>“Agh?” Adam raised an eyebrow in confusion. “What does that mean?”</p><br><p>In response, Arayna pointed ahead, where many kilometers away stood a great fortress and high walls with soldiers on constant patrol.</p><br><p>“Nothing can survive the World Wipe completely. I think you should have understood that by now. The Citadel is no exception, as only the First Ring, its center, remains intact. The Bastions await the same fate.”</p><br><br><br><p>“Who defends the Bastions?”</p><br><p>“Isn’t that obvious?” Arayna asked seriously. “Of course, the Second Rank Phantoms.”</p>
