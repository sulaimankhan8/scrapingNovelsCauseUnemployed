            <br><p>Four mechanical arms emerged from the monster's broad back, consisting of flesh and metal covering its vulnerable body.</p><br><p>At the end of each arm was an inactive circular saw, all of them badly damaged from many battles, but still deadly to any of their victims.</p><br><p>Any creature unlucky enough to be caught between four saws at once would be minced in a heartbeat.</p><br><p>The saws were dangerous because, unlike a sharp sword or a long spear, they did not cut or pierce, but tore flesh apart, causing terrible damage, as well as profuse bleeding and, most importantly - insane pain.</p><br><p>However, like any weapon, saws had their own disadvantages - unlike spears, they could not pierce the target through and instantly crush the heart or any other important organ.</p><br><p>Moreover, it took some time for the saws to do their full damage, as the more they tore the flesh, the better it was for the owner of this unusual weapon.</p><br><p>In addition to the four saws on its back, the monster had two paws with only two sharp claws, but long enough to pierce a wall several meters thick.</p><br><p>On its chest were two massive plates that went all the way up to its shoulders. The legs were thick and somewhat crooked, to maintain an unusual balance, short but sharp claws digging into the ground.</p><br><p>Streams of flames were constantly coming out of the monster's head like a wild mixture of an enraged bull and a dragon as if the monster couldn't contain them within itself.</p><br><p>"What is that enormous thing?" Adam asked, the monster was actually large - about five meters tall.</p><br><p>'Firebreathing Trinadon is one of the most dangerous monsters that can be encountered next to Iron Beak. It's a Prime Type because it has protective plates and has four saws, Purple Threat Level, Red Book.' Silvana answered quickly, sating Adam's interest.</p><br><p>Adam nodded, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.</p><br><p>Silvana continued, 'Firebreathing Trinadons have one global disadvantage - they are rarely in groups and at most go in twos or threes. In the case of Prime Type, however, they are almost always loners.'</p><br><p>"I see..." Adam shifted his gaze from the monster to the squad that was almost ready to act.</p><br><p>This squad was relatively small - five Phantoms and about ten Harvesters. They only needed a few trucks to get here.</p><br><p>'This is the Light Rain squad. Their leader is this girl with long blonde hair - Iren Langland. She's a pretty capable K1-Phantom, she has a lot of achievements.' Silvana calmly explained.</p><br><p>"Hm? A lot of achievements? What do you mean?" Adam tilted his head in confusion, while the Light Rain squad moved towards Firebreathing Trinadon.</p><br><p>'Well, I'd call her an honors student from the Phantom world. Both of her parents are K3-Phantoms, so she has a decent bloodline, which led to her having Spark. She went through the preparatory academy like everyone else, killed her first monster, and went to Dead Lands.'</p><br><br><p>'Sure, unlike you or Alexia, her first missions weren't accompanied by incredible success and equally great risks. But, in her case, things happened gradually, and she always managed to get through the challenges.'</p><br><p>"Well, I can see by the look in her eyes that she's quite experienced."</p><br><br><p>'She hasn't failed a single mission yet, not counting emergencies. Her reputation is one of the best among the K1-Phantoms. She is foreshadowed to have a future as great as her parents.</p><br><p>"Reputation?" Adam raised an eyebrow, interested, "Hey, what about me? Is there any information you got on me?"</p><br><p>'Khm... It's not that simple...' Silvana coughed, she hadn't counted on Adam being interested in it at a time like this.</p><br><p>"Agh... Looks like Iren's reputation is a long way off for me..." Adam muttered, realizing everything by Silvana's reaction.</p><br><p>'Something like that. Power rating and reputation are different and almost unrelated things. I mean, reputation is determined by two factors - the feedback of the common people and the so-called critics, which includes everyone associated with Dead Lands, from Phantoms and Operators to departments and the military.</p><br><p>"Oh, that sounds interesting. Tell me, what they say about me?" Adam asked, he was clearly curious but didn't seem to give it any meaning.</p><br><p>'Well... Critics rarely leave reviews as they are too busy to do so, they have other tasks, and for them, the most important thing is that Phantom is strong and accomplishes missions. They rely more on internal power ratings to judge some Phantom.</p><br><p>Thus, 80% of the reputation of a particular Phantom is determined by the will of the common people. They usually only watch the popular edits of a particular Phantom's fights as well as the popular videos of it filmed somewhere in the Citadel.' Silvana calmly said.</p><br><p>It was worth remembering that anyone could get detailed information about any mission from Dead Lands if they submitted a request to the missions department, including videos of the Phantoms' NEPs. Almost no one did that, though.</p><br><p>Everyone wanted to watch edited clips of another Phantom tearing apart monsters as if in some game. It was rare for ordinary people to watch missions in their entirety, and no one posted videos of failures, especially Phantom deaths...</p><br><p>"80%...? Damn, that's a lot. But, my reputation should be pretty high, shouldn't it? I mean, it's not like I'm a criminal. I didn't do anything wrong in the Citadel." Adam assumed with a wave of his hand.</p><br><p>Silvana was silent for a while, then she sighed, heavily as if facing imminent disaster and said:</p><br><p>'You're wrong... And badly enough. You're right, you're not a criminal, but have you forgotten what happened at the fair?'</p><br><p>'Furthermore, although the records of your sentence have been deleted, there are photos of you leaving Fall Hill Prison online, as well as videos of Proud Wing and that woman you insulted even though she blamed you for her daughter's death.' Silvana muttered, recounting some of the events.'</p><br><p>"What, I'm not guilty of any of that!"</p><br><p>'Yes. I agree with you, but that said, your reputation is still rated F-Rank.''</p><br><p>"Well... That's not so bad, I suppose." Adam scratched the back of his head.</p><br><p>'Below F-Rank, there's nothing.'</p><br>
