            <h4>Chapter 1125: Flaming Countdown (Part 1)</h4><br><p>Lone Blaze had been waiting for this moment. She wanted Adam to use the ability she had created from her energy and Adam’s clusters.
</p><br><p>She should have finished the work much earlier than his transition to the K4-Level, but many events happened quite quickly that delayed this moment.
</p><br><p>Nothing was holding Adam or Lone Blaze back anymore.
</p><br><p>A bunch of monsters surrounded him, but Adam wasn’t worried. He knew they wouldn’t be a problem for him, and the mysterious monster hiding in the tower wouldn’t act before it was time.
</p><br><p>If Adam was a threat to them, and he was, then the monster had to see what Adam was capable of. Moreover, perhaps dozens of monsters would be able to hurt him.
</p><br><br><p>A stream of flame engulfed Adam, but instead of becoming stronger, it froze, gradually thickening and heading towards his hands.
</p><br><p>At the same time, Adam’s mind traveled to his inner space.
</p><br><p>There he met Lone Blaze, who held a clump of fire full of energy between her hands.
</p><br><p>"So, you finally decided to try it, right?"
</p><br><p>Adam nodded with a broad smile.
</p><br><p>"Yeah, something like that. I hope you’re not offended that it took so long?"
</p><br><p>In response, Lone Blaze simply shook her head.
</p><br><p>"Of course not. After all, this space and this small world belong to you. I just hope I was able to make something that suits you. It’s rare for an External Artifact to have such an opportunity."
</p><br><br><p>"Well, in that case, show me what it is and I can decide if it was the right decision or not!"
</p><br><p>Without delay, Lone Blaze released the fire stored between her hands as a red stream headed toward Adam, leaving only his frame visible.
</p><br><p>[String of Hunger Charcoals
</p><br><p>Flame and aggressive power. The threads will follow yours to destroy your enemies if that is your desire. Do not hold back your power, no matter how dangerous the consequences may seem, otherwise, all you will achieve is the worst possible outcome.
</p><br><p>Not only threads, but strings are your allies, even in such a dangerous form.]
</p><br><p>The monsters around Adam in the real world began to move. They wanted to attack and get rid of him. This meant that he had less time than ever. However, he was not going to rush, because, in addition to the description of his new ability, he was receiving all the necessary data.
</p><br><p>"Good, well done, Lone Blaze. I can already see that you did everything right. However, I will only be able to say this with certainty once I try it in battle."
</p><br><p>In response, Lone Blaze nodded as her slight smile slowly turned into a dangerous grin.
</p><br><p>"That’s what I expected to hear. Go ahead, use my ability, my fire, and your energy with threads to turn these monsters into nothing more than pieces of burnt flesh!"
</p><br><p>Adam said nothing, he just nodded deeply and closed his eyes.
</p><br><p>The next moment, he saw dozens of jaws wide open around him. In a few more seconds, the monster’s claws would reach his face. The few knights in the back rows were ready to attack as well, waiting for the right moment.
</p><br><p>"Hah, you’re not going to waste any time, right?"
</p><br><p>Adam shook his head as his gaze dropped lower.
</p><br><p>Strangely enough, there was no trace of fire left.
</p><br><p>Instead of red flames, he held two black, iron rods with sharp tips in his hands. They were neither hot nor even warm; on the contrary, they radiated coldness like any metal.
</p><br><p>It was almost imperceptible, but threads were woven around each rod; they were not silver as usual, but dark, as if made of dirty metal.
</p><br><p>"Well." Adam tossed the rods, deftly catching his new weapons. "Let’s see how effective they are in battle!"
</p><br><br><p>In a dark flash, Adam broke through the first row of monsters. With his right rod, he pierced the monster’s head, causing blood to spurt everywhere. Another beast tried to sink its claws into his chest, but one strike from Adam’s left rod shattered its long claws into pieces.
</p><br><br><p>Adam’s feet touched the ground as he looked at his rods.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>They shook slightly as Adam felt the rods’ temperature rise, albeit slowly.
</p><br><p>However, Adam needed to focus on the fact that his attack had killed only one monster.
</p><br><p>Still, he was very pleased with this because he saw a piece of metal thread sticking out of the monster’s dead body like a needle.
</p><br><p>"Hah, the longer I fight, the better, right?"
</p><br><p>In a burst of emotion, he did not notice that a mysterious figure was closely watching his every move. Its two large green eyes trembled actively, reflecting Adam’s image.
</p><br><p>More than ten monsters attacked Adam at once. It was unlikely that they wanted revenge; rather, they wanted to deal with the Phantom who had come to their land to kill and steal their resources.
</p><br><br><p>The figure blinked as Adam’s frame shook.
</p><br><p>In an instant, a red spark lit up on his rods — exactly the same as on the body of the dead monster, right at the tip of the thread.
</p><br><p>The next thing the figure saw was Adam rushing through the monsters, following the fiery path created between his rods and spark thread.
</p><br><p>In less than a second, Adam was at the dead monster’s side, leaving behind a trail of torn bodies.
</p><br><p>A light smoke began to rise from his rods as the threads began to glow. A little more time and killing, and his rods would be burning at full power.
</p><br><p>A single drop of sweat ran down Adam’s forehead, causing his insidious grin to twitch.
</p><br><p>"Hah, at some point, the heat will become too much even for me, but..."
</p><br><p>He turned around to see the frightened faces of the monsters.
</p><br><p>They didn’t rush to attack because they didn’t understand what was happening. One moment they almost touched Adam, the next there was only blood and corpses.
</p><br><p>"I think these guys will turn into burning embers faster than I get tired."
</p><br><p>He gripped his rods tighter.
</p><br><p>"I can guarantee that!"</p>
