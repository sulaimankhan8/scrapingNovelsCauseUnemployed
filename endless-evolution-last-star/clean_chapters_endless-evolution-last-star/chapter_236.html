            <br><p>Food - that essential element of life, had accompanied humanity from the very beginning and would remain until the end or even after the last man breathed his final sigh.</p><br><p>Everyone knew that food was necessary to simply live, but it could also give strength and heal, as well as lead to poisoning or death if the food was poisonous.</p><br><p>In any case, water was as necessary for any living creature as water and oxygen. Humans, however, had long ago stopped considering food as a source of calories, for humanity, food represented another value - pleasure.</p><br><p>Sure, food was only a source of pleasure when it was plentiful, but in the Citadel only the slums could have a problem with food.</p><br><p>Most people in the Third Ring could afford to eat meat a few times a week, while in the Second Ring, even delicacies on a daily basis were not a problem.</p><br><p>The First Ring had the finest restaurants ready to offer unusual dishes made of rare ingredients as well as the skill of their chefs.</p><br><p>It should not be forgotten that although the Phantoms and Departments were the backbone of the Citadel as they defended the city from monsters, inside, normal life continued.</p><br><p>Not everyone could and had to participate in the battle against the monsters, the city had to continue to function, and for that, it needed businesses, civil servants, various entertainments, and so on.</p><br><p>But... As is well known, most monsters consist of flesh. Has no one ever dared to taste a monster?</p><br><br><p>Adam was about to eat a cookie but stopped upon hearing Magnus's words. Silvana was greatly surprised as well, while Nessa already knew what Magnus was going to offer.</p><br><p>"What...? I can heal my arm if I eat a monster? What the fuck did I just hear...?" Adam muttered uncertainly.</p><br><p>"Hahaha, what a confused look on your face." Magnus chuckled evilly.</p><br><p>Then he pointed at Adam's right hand and said:</p><br><p>"My way is that you'll use the monster's cells to regenerate your arm. Sure, it's not that simple." Magnus's voice became more serious as a sharp glint passed across his eyes.</p><br><p>"All of this will take place under my careful supervision, with many tests as well as various equipment that will monitor your current condition to avoid incidents. And... You didn't think it would be a simple monster, did you?" Magnus's corners of his mouth lifted.</p><br><p>Adam smiled bitterly, setting the cookie aside and taking the cup of tea in his hand, sighing at the pleasant aroma.</p><br><p>"I don't know what monster you're talking about so much as your method. All I want to know is what I have to do, what happens next, how long it takes, and what the risks are. I came here because I don't want to wait half a year for my arm to be built piece by piece, you know?" Adam said calmly.</p><br><p>Magnus lifted his chin.</p><br><p>"I see... Well, I like your approach. Anyway, you will have to eat some special kinds of monsters, I would compare them to anomalous ones, they are not a separate Type, but they deserve to have their own category. However, we have a lot to do before that."</p><br><p>Magnus sighed as he said, "Adam, have you ever eaten monster meat? I'm not talking about what you have to do for a cure in my lab, but a simple meal."</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>Then, he gave a short laugh with a shake of his head.</p><br><p>"Until now, I didn't even know such a thing was possible. Who would even eat monsters? What's the point? Moreover, even if I wanted to, where would I get monster meat?" Adam shook his head, thinking Magnus was just joking.</p><br><p>Adam seriously took Magnus's words about curing by eating the flesh of a particular monster. It coincided with his expectations that Magnus's method would be strange but theoretically effective.</p><br><p>But, he didn't even realize that someone might actually want to eat monsters and actively participate in it. At least, because even the First Ring restaurant didn't have dishes made of monsters.</p><br><p>"Hey... I'm not kidding." Magnus said coldly, piercing Adam with his stare, "However, you're not lying either, that's obvious... Adam, what do you think happens to the monsters after you Phantoms kill them?"</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow. Every Phantom knew the answer to that question, even complete rookies who weren't even three days old.</p><br><p>"Harvesters take useful materials from the monsters, after they die the monsters become significantly weaker. Energy leaves the flesh along with the blood, making it possible for simple but sharp tools to separate claws or fangs from the body. Then, the materials are used for a variety of purposes." Adam said calmly, making Silvana smile slightly. She was the one who had taught him all of this.</p><br><p>At many points, she acted like a teacher, and it was always nice to see that the explanations didn't get past the student.</p><br><p>"Oh, what an elaborate answer." Magnus muttered as he glanced at Silvana, "Nice work. Sounds like you deserve to be the Operator of such a Phantom."</p><br><p>"But..." Magnus continued in a low voice, "What happens to meat? Let your Operator answer that question."</p><br><p>Silvana's face immediately changed as she became deadly serious.</p><br><p>"It depends on the type of monsters, some meat is brought to the Citadel and destroyed, in other cases, especially if the monsters are weak the meat is left in the Dead Lands.</p><br><p>Sometimes, meat can be used as bait to hunt some Nests to lure monsters out. It's extremely rare to get energy from meat, or rather blood, but that depends on the subspecies of the monster rather than luck."</p><br><br><p>"Sure, but you forgot about something. That's not surprising, though. Getting information about it is difficult, even for an Operator of your level. The meat of some monsters is sent to the black market right into the kitchens of restaurants hidden from the public eye." Magnus said confidently.</p><br><p>"Wait... That means..."</p><br><br><p>"In the Citadel, every day, people eat the monster meat, of various Threat Levels. These include Phantoms as well as many others, from politicians to the military. There are even ordinary people among them, usually businessmen. Sure, I am one of the older and respected gourmets." Magnus smirked slyly as she turned her head to the side.</p><br><p>Adam placed the cup on the table, rubbing his chin as he muttered:</p><br><p>"People eat monsters... Unbelievable... but, isn't that dangerous? Isn't simple food enough? The food at the First Ring restaurant was unforgettably delicious..."</p><br><br><p>Magnus abruptly stood up as he waved his arms in different directions with a slightly frantic look.</p><br><p>"Of course! No delicacy, marbled meat, fish, or huge shrimp can compare to the flesh of a strong monster! It's a completely different level, and only exceptional persons have access to this bliss. An ordinary person will never taste the meat of even a White Threat Level monster in their lifetime!"</p><br><p>Adam's eyes went wide.</p><br><p>"Much tastier... This... This is... This is weird, it shouldn't be like this... Monsters are monsters, this isn't food..." Adam muttered, he seemed to hesitate, trying to sort out his thoughts.</p><br><p>Magnus narrowed his eyes, ready to throw out his trump card.</p><br><br><p>Magnus bent over, their eyes at the same level, as he said with a wide grin:</p><br><p>"There's nothing strange about it, it's just a new experience. Come on, you as Phantom, should understand this better than I do. Imagine how delicious Thunder Demon would be... Hah, you know, unlike you, he tasted you properly. He ate your entire arm!" Magnus exclaimed.</p><br><p>His words were like enchanting ghosts entering Adam's mind.</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.</p><br><p>Suddenly, Adam's Evolution Tree began to tremble, as if wanting to be part of the feast that Magnus spoke of.</p><br><p>"Thunder Demon... What does he taste like...?" Adam muttered not noticing that the veins around his eyes swelled as if during a Resonance.</p>
