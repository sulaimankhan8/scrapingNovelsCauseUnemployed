            <br><p>Sometimes a few seconds were enough to ruin a peaceful morning and change plans, even if Phantom and Operator wanted to go into the Dead Lands to fight against monsters in the name of the Citadel.</p><br><p>Slowly, without breaking any traffic laws, obeying all the necessary regulations, the black car was moving along the Third Ring towards the Iron Observatory.</p><br><p>There were only three people in the car - Adam and Silvana were in the back seat, while Stina was in the driver's one, buckled in and holding the steering wheel with both hands.</p><br><p>Considering their speed their trip would be a long one, Adam didn't have that much patience especially given what Stina said earlier, so he decided to try to find out the details again:</p><br><p>"Hey, I realize you have no right to explain anything to us, but why did you inform us? I mean, it's usually government employees or military personnel who do this. But, you... you're a scientist at the observatory."</p><br><p>At the last words, Adam's tone grew heavier. Sure, Stina wasn't a free scientist like Magnus or Aiden, the difference between them formed an impassable abyss, but Adam realized that Stina was unique since she was already a scientist.</p><br><p>Without taking her eyes off the road, Stina replied:</p><br><p>"Please don't try to embarrass me with compliments."</p><br><p>Though Adam didn't say anything specific, Stina understood what he meant.</p><br><p>"And, I am not as young as you think I am. I'm older than you or Silvana. The Iron Observatory not only experiments with technology and iron but also the biological side of science, we often co-op with scientists from the Miracle Observatory."</p><br><p>Not knowing what to answer, Adam just stared at Stina.</p><br><p>But, her answer didn't satisfy someone else - Silvana, she frowned heavily narrowing her eyes.</p><br><p>"You told us something we didn't ask you to do and yet you ignored our original question. You scared us with the importance of this procedure, but instead of calming us down you're doing everything you can to increase panic!"</p><br><p>Despite her expectations, this did not convince Stina to talk. She wasn't allowed to tell them the details and she wasn't about to break that rule.</p><br><p>"All I can say is that it was a personal order from Ms. Refesa. You've never visited the Iron Observatory before, so it's a mystery to me."</p><br><p>Then, Adam and Silvana glanced around as they finally got some clues. They remembered how Nessa appeared at Fume Cathedral and the unusual fighter jet. There was only one place in the Citadel where such things could appear and only another free scientist could help Nessa - her father: Magnus.</p><br><p>Stina didn't say another word. The whole trip they were silent, no one prevented Adam and Silvana from talking about anything, but they just didn't have the desire for it.</p><br><p>All their thoughts were occupied with what awaited them at the Iron Observatory.</p><br><br><p>With a slight push, Stina stopped in front of the massive iron gate. Several sensors checked everything inside and outside the car before letting them inside.</p><br><p>The massive steel building in the center like an evil sorcerer's castle towered above them, being their destination.</p><br><br><p>Stepping out of the car and adjusting her collar, Stina turned around:</p><br><p>"Please follow me, someone is already waiting for us. In fact, we're late."</p><br><p>Adam frowned, pacing behind her with a disgruntled face.</p><br><p>'Damn, because we should have gone faster! I almost died of impatience!' he thought.</p><br><br><p>Before entering the main building, Adam lifted his head, looking up at the very top. This was the second Observatory he entered.</p><br><p>'Agh, it went pretty rough the first time, hopefully, things will be smooth and easy now. Especially since Silvana is involved. Failure is unacceptable.'</p><br><p>When Nessa and Magnus were here they went to the bottom floor, but for Adam and Silvana it was the complete opposite way.</p><br><br><p>Stina summoned the elevator, classical music echoing through the long corridors, oddly blended with the many mechanical exhibits, most of which Refesa considered as failures.</p><br><p>Looking around carefully, with a genuine interest in his gaze, Adam wondered.</p><br><p>'Hmmm... Magnus focused on monsters and a bit on ordinary humans since Nessa is a hybrid and he's trying to replicate his success or learn more about her. Refesa is focused on technology, but... why did we come here then?'</p><br><p>Adam didn't know what exactly he and Silvana were going through, but he didn't think technology could affect him in any way since he was a K2-Phantom.</p><br><p>The point was that free scientists didn't just do one thing. They all had their projects, and they might be very different from each other. Still, there were reasons why Adam and Silvana were here and why Stina and Refesa looked much younger than they were.</p><br><br><p>The elevator door opened, as the music stopped, leaving only a deep, slightly frightening silence.</p><br><p>"Let's go. We're almost there."</p><br><p>Adam turned around, glancing at Silvana as his eyes grew wider for a moment. She tried to keep a calm face, but Adam could see that she was anxious, that feeling growing stronger with each passing second.</p><br><p>Soon, they were at the very top.</p><br><p>As with Magnus's lab, this entire building was Refesa's domain. The other scientists were here as well, but unlike the other buildings at the Iron Observatory where they worked, here they could only visit certain areas.</p><br><p>Everything else was only for Refesa or by special permission like this time.</p><br><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br><p>With a loud crack, the massive iron gates came into motion.</p><br><p>Stepping inside they found themselves in a spacious room full of blueprints, bits of metal, chips, and workbenches.</p><br><p>Behind one of the workbenches stood a girl with toxic, bright pink hair with two ponytails, looking at something on a holographic 3D schematic.</p><br><p>This was Refesa's house, but this was where she slept, spent her free time, cooked, and so on.</p><br><p>From the top floor through the panoramic windows, there was a great view of the quiet part of the Third Ring and the nearest fort in the distance - Fort Fereno.</p><br><p>However, over the years this place turned into Refesa's local workshop, where she would initially test her theories or just try to create something out of improvised materials.</p><br><br><p>Taking a few steps forward, Stina stopped looking calmly at Refesa, who was still standing with her back to them.</p><br><p>"Ms. Refesa, just as you told me I found Adam Vinter and Silvana Desio."</p><br><br><p>There was no reply, Refesa just scratched the back of her head as she continued to ponder something.</p><br><p>Stina was a bit stumped, it was clear from her confused expression.</p><br><br><p>She repeated the same thing a few more times, raising her voice each time, but... nothing was able to get Refesa's attention.</p><br><br><p>A bare fist slammed into the wall, with menacing force creating a loud rumble, a shudder went through the walls causing the lamps to spark for a while.</p><br><p>"Hopefully that will be enough." Adam said calmly, kneading his wrist.</p><br><p>Refesa looked up looking at the lamps, she narrowed her aquamarine unusual eyes slightly and turned around.</p><br><p>"Oh! Stina, you're finally here! Did you just stand there and remain silent? Was it so hard to call me out?"</p><br><p>Sincere wonder was visible on Refesa's face.</p><br><p>Stina gulped as she hesitantly said:</p><br><p>"Ms. Refesa, we arrived a moment ago, and... you didn't respond to my voice."</p><br><p>Did Refesa hear her?</p><br><p>Well, all she saw was Stina's lips moving, but her words were lost amongst the other sobs.</p><br><p>"Damn, I completely forgot!"</p><br><p>Refesa shook her head, her ponytails swaying to the side revealing two small earpieces fully covering her ears.</p><br><br><p>Pulling the headphones out and tucking them into her pocket, Refesa placed her hands at her sides smiling widely:</p><br><p>"So, you agreed to do this after the first sentence? Come on, I'll tell you everything in detail. Stina, you're coming with us too, it'll be a rewarding experience for you!"</p><br><p>Leaving Stina and Silvana with surprised faces, Refesa headed for another part of Refesa's house, free of workbenches and blueprints - the kitchen.</p><br><br><p>With a snap of her fingers, a mechanical arm protruding from the wall moved and poured her hot coffee. Then, it opened the door of a huge refrigerator buried in the wall and extended itself heading in - all to pull out a package of six pink-glazed donuts.</p><br><p>First to go was Adam, for some reason, Silvana and Stina were nervous, unlike Adam, they weren't thinking about how serene Refesa was acting but about her status.</p><br><p>"Hah, it's quite handy. How much does it cost to buy one of these?" Adam asked pointing to the mechanical arm.</p><br><p>Refesa took a bite out of her donut and took a sip of coffee, a smirk appearing on her face.</p><br><p>"Young man, you have not yet grown to the point of demanding a free scientist to do your bidding. You're still a long way from that level."</p><br><p>Then, she gave Stina a hard stare.</p><br><p>"I hope you didn't tell them anything? Not that I mind, but the military would be furious if they found out you were talking about it in an unsafe place."</p><br><p>In response, Stina shook her head calmly.</p><br><p>"Sure, as you asked, I understand the risks."</p><br><br><p>Taking another sip, Refesa nodded deeply.</p><br><br><p>She then looked sternly at Adam and Silvana, gesturing for them to take a seat on the opposite couch.</p><br><p>"So... Adam and Silvana, even though you came here, that doesn't mean you're ready."</p><br><p>"For what?" Adam asked, with a frown, his patience was reaching its limit.</p><br><p>At the same moment, Refesa's eyes grew deeper - it seemed she could see right through them, even read their minds. Find more adventures on My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>"To Gene Diffusion - a special procedure only available after Phantom has created the First Key. The explanations will be long, but... if you dare to do it, you're in for a serious challenge."</p><br><br><p>Stepping forward and poking Adam in the chest, Refesa pointed at Silvana.</p><br><p>"In the process of the Gene Diffusion, some of your genes will end up in Silvana, and I'm not talking about your blood but energy, genes straight from your Evolution Tree!"</p>
