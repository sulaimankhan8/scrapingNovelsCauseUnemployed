            <br><br><p>Fromund and Zarot reached an agreement, so it was time to move to action. Fromund didn't waste any more time, he took a confident step towards the door.</p><br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda heard his heavy footsteps, their eyes went wide. It was a sign that they needed to get back to their rooms as quickly as possible before their big brother realized that they overheard all this time.</p><br><p>'Hurry up!' Elva internally exclaimed, gesturing for her sisters to leave.</p><br><br><p>The door slowly opened with an audible creak along the passage.</p><br><p>The three girls looked up uncertainly, meeting Fromund's stare, awkward smiles appearing on their faces.</p><br><p>"Brother... We are..." Elva muttered trying to think of some excuse.</p><br><p>Fromund took a deep breath and stepped forward, scratching Elva's head and ruffling her hair.</p><br><p>"Agh, did you really think I didn't notice you? Hah, I'm fighting against monsters, so I have no problem hearing three disobedient girls eavesdropping on someone else's conversation instead of going to bed."</p><br><p>Liv and Tilda gulped as they guiltily lowered their gaze. They knew they shouldn't be doing this, they were only teenagers and this wasn't a conversation they could participate in.</p><br><br><p>However, Fromund didn't punish or scold them in any way, instead, he strode ahead and waved his hand.</p><br><p>"Well, it was your decision. When you go to bed in the morning and then wake up closer to evening, you'll regret being here now and not in your beds."</p><br><p>Elva, Liv, and Tilda glanced over, confusion on their faces, then they looked at their brother.</p><br><p>"Hmm...? Sleep in the morning?" Elva tilted her head.</p><br><p>Fromund nodded before smiling widely, pointing at himself with his thumb.</p><br><p>"Of course! Are you telling me you're not going to watch my fight? You know I'm going to win and make a lot of money!"</p><br><p>The girls' eyes opened wide, they shone like gems from excitement, and their faces filled with happiness.</p><br><p>"Yay! Let's go to the arena!" Liv exclaimed throwing her arms up.</p><br><p>"Ughu!" Tilda nodded a few times, clenching her small fists tightly.</p><br><p>Discover hidden content at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>Fromund turned around, glaring at Zarot who stood in the doorway.</p><br><p>"That's not a problem, is it?"</p><br><p>Zarot shook his head, his expression calm and serious. Everything was settled, they couldn't back out. Their fighter was chosen and they had to announce their decision within two minutes, otherwise, their time would run out and the Marzo Family would fail in their commitment to The Rule of Power.</p><br><p>"Don't worry, your sisters will get the best seats, next to the Marzo and Rouzet Families. However... are you ready to fight? According to the rules of the Moon Colosseum, the battle should begin in a little over an hour, when the moon disappears over the horizon."</p><br><p>Zarot looked intently at Fromund. Because of Gladius's interference, because Adam announced The Rule of Power late in the evening and the fight was prepared at the Moon Colosseum, the Marzo Family, had a very limited amount of time.</p><br><p>If they had even a day or more than twelve hours, they would not only have time to choose a fighter but also to properly prepare him for battle and let him rest.</p><br><p>"Hmm... Am I ready to fight? Well, I wasn't ready for your arrival, but knowing what lies ahead and what's at stake, I don't feel sleepy at all. Although... I think I'm a little hungry. I don't like to fight on an empty stomach." Fromund replied, scratching the back of his head, his gaze directed downward.</p><br><p>Mariel walked over to Zarot, standing beside him.</p><br><p>"That's not a problem. On the way to the First Ring, we can order in advance and eat in the car so we don't waste time. Just tell us what you want."</p><br><p>Elva gulped as she glanced at Mariel from bottom to top.</p><br><p>"Do we also...? I can eat nothing, I'm full from dinner... but for Liv and Tilda..."</p><br><p>In response, Mariel squatted down, gently laying her hands on Elva's shoulders.</p><br><p>"Don't worry, you can all order as much food as you want. Unfortunately, only a fraction of the cafes and restaurants are open at night, but I'm sure we can find something decent."</p><br><p>Mariel smiled caringly, like a mother in front of her child.</p><br><p>Elva's mouth dropped, she didn't know what to answer, but it was clear by the look in her eyes that she hadn't even counted on such a thing.</p><br><p>"Wow! So the nobles turn out to be kind! I thought you were bad since you're rich!" Liv exclaimed with shining eyes.</p><br><p>Mariel smiled bitterly, turning to her.</p><br><p>"Where do you even get these associations from? Not all rich people are bad and not all poor people are good, it all depends on the person."</p><br><p>Tilda touched her lower lip, with a thoughtful look.</p><br><p>"But... a lot can depend on the situation and what side you're on, villains in movies act for some reason, don't they?"</p><br><p>Mariel's eyes went wide for a moment, then she nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yes, you're right. Tilda... right? You're a very smart girl, all of you..."</p><br><p>Tilda blushed slightly, looking away to the side, her cheeks puffed up.</p><br><p>Zarot shook his head, not wanting to get involved in this.</p><br><p>He pulled out his phone, time was almost running out, he should announce the second fighter right now.</p><br><p>"Your Nexus. Do you have your weapon with you?" Zarot asked, holding his finger over the screen.</p><br><p>"Sure." Fromund nodded, "Push the button. A few cans of energy drinks and fatty hearty food and I'll be at my prime for the next few hours. I'll do whatever it takes to win and I'll fight to the best of my ability. After all, I have as much to lose as you do..."</p><br><p>In response, Zarot merely tapped the screen. He didn't need any more confirmation. He was satisfied with the choice as this was their best opportunity to win and end the wedding.</p><br><p>A few seconds after that, the information reached whoever was in charge of the purple room.</p><br><p>"Excellent choice." A calm voice rang out followed by a click.</p><br><p>Then, everyone saw the left, previously empty cell shine brightly, revealing the image of the second fighter.</p>
