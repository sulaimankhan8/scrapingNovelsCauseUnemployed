            <br><p>For an unknown amount of time, Adam lay amidst the darkness, remembering his use of the Global Gene. One time, he succeeded, but the second time, he lacked the energy or mastery to control the form.</p><br><p>'Hmm...' Adam mused staring into the void, 'The Evolution Tree is right... The Global Gene is a tool, not a weapon. If I want to build my battle using only energy, I'll lose quickly.'</p><br><p>Without haste, Adam stood up, his eyes deep.</p><br><p>'Well, the Global Gene can't surpass power abilities, but its functionality is much wider.'</p><br><p>After a few moments of silence, a powerful voice came from behind:</p><br><p>[Hey... You can stay here as long as you want... after all, this is your inner space, but... I think someone's waiting for you.]</p><br><p>Adam nodded weakly. He understood what the Evolution Tree was referring to.</p><br><p>"Yeah, I think you're right." Adam glanced at the Crystal Gates, "Anyway, I don't think I can open the first gates that easily. I'll have to work for it."</p><br><p>Then, Adam closed his eyes tightly, returning to the real world.</p><br><p>The first thing he saw was the light from the crystal, Queen Elisa was as always in a deep sleep, but now he could clearly hear her heart beating, very slowly, but distinctly like a clock.</p><br><p>Adam turned to look at Douglas, Seyrina, and... the most important one - Silvana.</p><br><p>With a slight smile on his face, Adam stepped forward. Before Silvana realized it, Adam was in front of her.</p><br><p>Silvana's eyes went wide in disbelief, for Adam's appearance had changed. Because of the Queen's influence, what happened in inner space remained in the real world.</p><br><p>His hair was much longer than Silvana's or even Seyrina's, and his body was so dry that there didn't seem to be a gram of fat under his skin. It was not a healthy appearance, not for a human or a monster.</p><br><p>However, something in his eyes kept Silvana from panicking. The confidence and calmness were unwavering, conveying those feelings to Silvana.</p><br><br><p>Without warning, Adam's hand reached out to Silvana, gently stroking her cheek.</p><br><p>"Hey, it's been so long since I've seen you... it feels more like forever."</p><br><p>His low voice, full of distant pain made Silvana believe what he said. She gulped, not knowing what she was supposed to do, after all, it was only an hour for her, compared to how much Adam had fought, it was nothing.</p><br><br><p>Douglas coughed, getting their attention.</p><br><p>"I understand your feelings, I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about, and... Adam, you should get yourself in shape. You look strange... although in this case, it's normal."</p><br><p>Then, Douglas took a deep breath as his gaze traveled to Queen Elisa.</p><br><p>"However, our time here came to an end. Adam has become a K3-Phantom, which means it's time to depart Heaven Island."</p><br><p>Before leaving, Douglas bowed low, paying his respects to the queen. Seyrina hurriedly performed the same gesture. Silvana hesitated for a few seconds but followed suit, she was grateful to the queen for allowing them to come here.</p><br><p>The only one who remained with his head held high was Adam. It wasn't a show of disrespect to the queen, he was just immersed in thought.</p><br><p>'So... You are the queen of the entire Citadel then, right? In that case... Where is your king?'</p><br><p>For a moment, Adam's eyes swept over to Douglas.</p><br><p>'Maybe your king is long dead? Or... Is it you he?'</p><br><p>Then, Adam inwardly shook his head.</p><br><p>'No... It can't be Douglas. He has too much respect for the queen. A king doesn't honor the queen, he complements her...'</p><br><p>'Hmm...' Adam mumbled.</p><br><p>'If the king is alive, if he exists at all, it must be someone special. Someone worthy of a queen... I wonder what the connection is between them? What are they willing to sacrifice for each other?'</p><br><br><p>The exit from Heaven Island was the same as the entrance - through a platform in an impenetrable barrier.</p><br><p>Did the people living at the First Ring center know that every day the platform goes up to the island unseen from the ground?</p><br><p>Well, it was no secret to the K3-Phantoms. Among the ordinary people who were not members of the Gamma Division, there were quite a few who knew about Heaven Island. This secret was only accessible to the highest members of the government and noble families who were not Phantoms.</p><br><p>Just like at the entrance, they were greeted by Nefis. She was still behind the terminal, operating the platform.</p><br><p>Upon seeing the four silhouettes, the wonder was visible on her face. She glanced at her watch, not believing her eyes.</p><br><p>"Mr. Douglas... You've been at the Heaven Island much longer than expected. Well... Given the reason for your visit."</p><br><p>Stepping off the platform, Douglas nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yes, everything went well. Seyrina needs to return to the Citadel walls. I will head to Fort Norton, as for Adam and Silvana... Well, they should get some rest."</p><br><p>Then, Douglas turned to them, his gaze serious.</p><br><p>"You can return to your homes, to the Third Ring or Nefis can send you to one of the best hotels in the First Ring - the Twilight Palace. It's a special place with an area just for people versed in the Dead Lands."</p><br><p>Douglas's eyes ran over Adam's exhausted body.</p><br><p>"You'll be back to normal in no time there. I suggest you take advantage of this offer, it's a hard place to get into, but it's worth it. After that you'll quickly be able to do what you want to do yourself, I'm sure you have goals."</p><br><p>With a slight smile on his face, Adam turned to Silvana. She nodded slightly showing with her whole look that the decision was up to him.</p><br><p>"Fine..." Adam nodded, "If the Twilight Palace will take care of me, I wouldn't mind giving it a try. Creating the Second Key, proved to be draining."</p><br><p>"Glad to hear it." Douglas smirked before jerking his head in Nefis's direction.</p><br><p>Without further question, Nefis clicked on the terminal.</p><br><br><p>Several doors opened, each leading to a different location.</p><br><p>Nefis pointed toward a lone door in the far north passage.</p><br><p>"Adam, Silvana, you're that way."</p><br><br><p>Adam took Silvana's hand firmly in his.</p><br><p>"Let's find out what's so special about this place. After the Heaven Island, nothing would surprise me."</p>
