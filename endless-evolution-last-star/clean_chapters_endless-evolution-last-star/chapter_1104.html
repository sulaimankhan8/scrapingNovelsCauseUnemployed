            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1104: Lifespan</strong></p><br><p>Whether Adam and Silvana wanted to or not, sooner or later, they would learn about the World Wipe, the 250 years, and the death of all those who were not strong enough to withstand the collision of stars under Queen Elisa’s protective barrier.</p><br><p>All they could do was accept it and look for a solution. However, they both understood that it was too early to think about it.</p><br><p>Until Adam became a Second Rank Phantom, there was no chance that a mere K4-Phantom could change the world. Compared to the Second Rank Phantoms and Lords, his power was insignificant, even though he was stronger than most creatures in this world.</p><br><p>“Shit!” Adam slammed his fist on the table as his eyes filled with rage. “Why did I even do all this if all I learn every time is that I need to become even stronger to change anything?!”</p><br><p>Wilfred glanced to the side. “Hmm? Adam, I understand that what you just heard isn’t good news, but think about it from another perspective.”</p><br><p>“Argh? What are you talking about?” Adam frowned.</p><br><p>With a slight wave of his hand, Wilfred pointed at Silvana.</p><br><p>“Your Operator and you… If you didn’t become a Phantom and progress to a K4-Level so quickly, you would both have died in 7 years. Now you don’t have to worry about that. Well, maybe you’ll die for another reason, but the World Wipe definitely won’t be the cause of your demise.”</p><br><p>Adam wanted to say something in response, but instead, he ruffled his hair in irritation. He knew Wilfred was right.</p><br><p>“Silvana and I, right? Tsk, now I understand why there’s nothing more important to a Phantom than an Operator. Fuck! Because you’re the only one who will survive after all of this!”</p><br><p>This time, Adam forgot to control his thoughts, so Silvana heard everything he said to himself. However, she felt the same way. Deep down, she was glad that Adam and she would survive, but that couldn’t compare to the grief of having to accept the death of everyone else.</p><br><p>“Two hundred and fifty years… That’s a fucking quarter of a millennium!” Adam scratched the back of his head. “To hell with the World Wipe, how can anyone live that long? It’s one thing for monsters, but we’re humans!”</p><br><p>Wilfred glanced at him as a smirk spread across his calm face.</p><br><p>“Hah, Adam, do you think it’s impossible?”</p><br><p>Adam waved his hand. “Of course! I mean, how long do people live? Fifty or sixty years?”</p><br><p>“Hahaha!” Wilfred laughed mockingly. “Adam, your ignorance amuses me.”</p><br><p>“WHAT?!” Adam spread his arms in confusion.</p><br><p>Seeking help, Adam turned to Silvana, but she only smiled awkwardly.</p><br><p>Wilfred touched his temple. “Look, Adam, maybe in the slums or the distant parts of the Lower Ring it’s really 50-60 years, but the average across the Citadel is 70-80 years. If you’re a nobleman or just rich and live in a good place, then 100-110 years is a realistic milestone for you.”</p><br><p>“And?” Adam raised an eyebrow. “That’s still a long way from 250 years! And you say that you and the other Phantoms have survived many World Wipes!”</p><br><p>“Yes, because that’s how it is. You’re forgetting about medicine and technology. For the nobles and residents of the First Ring, it’s possible to live to 150 years old. This is all due to a multitude of factors, but there is something that can give you much more than medicine or proper nutrition.”</p><br><p>Adam tilted his head, silently asking a question.</p><br><p>“Energy. Every level that a Phantom or monster overcomes potentially increases your lifespan. A K3-Phantom can easily live up to 350-400 years, with aging corresponding to how long you have left to live.”</p><br><p>“What does that mean?”</p><br><p>Wilfred exhaled a smoke ring. “Well, if your lifespan is 250 years and you’re 50 years old, you won’t look like a middle-aged man with wrinkles and gray hair. You’ve only lived 20% of your life if you take 100 years as the standard, so you’ll look 20 years old, not 50.”</p><br><p>Well, maybe Wilfred explained it, but Adam’s blank stare made it clear that he needed professional help in this matter.</p><br><p>“Ahem.” Silvana coughed. “Adam, Mr. Wilfred is simply saying that if a K3-Phantom looks like an old man, it means he has lived 80-90% of his lifespan. So, he’s not 90 years old, but around 300 or even more.”</p><br><p>After a while, Adam nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“Alright, let’s say I understand. What about me? I’m a K4-Phantom now, right? How long can I live?”</p><br><p>Wilfred’s eyes flashed at him like sharp blades.</p><br><p>“It all depends on what stage you’re at. You know that each new level is longer and more difficult than the previous one. Obviously, a K4-Level is no exception. But, considering your energy and the strength of your body, I think 500 years is no problem for you even now.”</p><br><p>“So… If I stop right now and do nothing, will I be able to see two World Wipes?”</p><br><p>Wilfred nodded deeply.</p><br><p>“Yeah, something like that. But, usually, Phantoms don’t even use a third of their lifespan. I mean, if one is destined to become a K4-Phantom, then they will be able to do so even in 100 years of a normal human’s life, not to mention 300 or 500 years.”</p><br><p>Then, Wilfred’s eyes darkened.</p><br><p>“It’s a completely different matter that almost no Phantoms die of old age. For the K1 and K2-Phantoms, the end will come with the World Wipe, as it will for most K3-Phantoms. What about those like you…?”</p><br><p>Wilfred leaned forward as he stared at Adam as if he could see into his soul.</p><br><p>“Well, I don’t know of any K4-Phantoms who haven’t tried to reach the Second Rank. It’s a basic instinct for self-preservation, a desire to survive, because, for the most part, you’re at the bottom of the food chain now, strange as that may sound after everything you’ve been through.”</p><br><p>A few moments later, Wilfred raised his chin, looking down at Adam as if he were a lower being.</p><br><p>“I doubt you’ll wait 500 years for your death. You’ll either reach the Second Circle or finally fail and perish.”</p>
