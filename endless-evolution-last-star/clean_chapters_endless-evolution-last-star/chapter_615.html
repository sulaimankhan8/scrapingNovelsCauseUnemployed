            <br><br><p>It was something Fromund knew about but didn't think of. He fought on the Moon Colosseum for the chance to get 125 million credits.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, the requirement was to win, and he lost, so Fromund would receive nothing for his fight.</p><br><p>Nevertheless, although he didn't get the money, he did get the spotlight. Not uncommonly, this was even more valuable than a direct monetary reward as connections opened up the most important thing to people in his situation - opportunities.</p><br><p>There was no telling how many influential people who had power in addition to money would pay attention to him, but he was sure to catch someone's eye.</p><br><br><p>Under a wave of applause, Osana fell to her knees, looking up at Adam, a slight smile on her face. It was now official, Kogen had declared the winner, which meant The Rule of Power was complete and nothing else could be changed.</p><br><p>"Freedom... I'm finally free..."</p><br><p>Tears of happiness flowed from Osana's pink eyes, shining brightly like gems full of the flame of life.</p><br><br><p>Baren approached Osana, the tips of his similarly pink hair fluttering in the wind. They exchanged glances and Baren silently placed his hand on Osana's shoulder, squeezing tightly.</p><br><p>"Even for the most cunning and calculated plans, sometimes the most important thing is trivial luck, isn't it?"</p><br><p>Baren muttered, his voice low and thoughtful, gazing intently at the dormant Adam.</p><br><p>Osana nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yes... I was lucky that three months ago our paths crossed in the Dead Lands. And... the battle against the Plague Reaper ended up saving me. It's strange, but that's the reality."</p><br><p>In response, a light chuckle rang out.</p><br><p>"How ironic. All the applause and attention is dedicated to him, but..." Baren narrowed his eyes watching Adam, Kogen still holding his right hand high, "He doesn't hear or see any of this."</p><br><br><p>Silvana stepped to the side, hugging Arayna gently. For some reason, she felt they had grown closer throughout the battle, even though they were Operators of two opponents.</p><br><p>"Don't worry. I'm sure it will be a rewarding experience for Fromund. And... honestly, he was frighteningly close to winning."</p><br><p>With a bitter smile on her face, Arayna nodded deeply.</p><br><p>"Yeah... I think so too. Fromund hates losing, he always says that any loss is two steps back and he'll have to work a lot harder to cover the failure. But... no one can win all the time, right?"</p><br><p>"Hah... Adam was the same way until he started losing hundreds of times..."</p><br><p>Watching the two Operators talk, Fromund sighed heavily and leaned back, dropping to the sun-warmed ground.</p><br><p>"I've done my job, so now I can finally rest, can't I? And..."</p><br><p>Fromund cast a glance at Arayna. Find your next read at My Virtual Library Empire</p><br><p>'Maybe I should finally do what that strange woman was talking about? Some Phantoms or Operators end up disappointed with their first choice, but... how can I doubt someone who supports me even when I've lost?'</p><br><p>With a mind full of various thoughts, Fromund slowly closed his eyes, returning to his sweet slumber where Adam had earlier plunged him.</p><br><p>'He spent the ability of his Nexus to put me to sleep... Did he mean to do that from the beginning or was it a simple improvisation? Agh... never mind, it's already finished.'</p><br><p>For the fighters, it was actually the end, but... for some events started long ago, the end of the battle was just one point.</p><br><p>Franz and Gladius exchanged a glance, something ominous and dark lurking in Gladius's blue as the depths of the sea eyes.</p><br><p>'I hope you haven't changed your mind?'</p><br><p>Gladius said nothing, his lips remained motionless, but Franz understood without words.</p><br><p>And, he answered just as silently with his confident gaze, full of certainty.</p><br><br><p>The battle was long and hard accompanied by many wounds, so Adam and Fromund took a long time to fully recover.</p><br><p>Experienced doctors from the military department did everything necessary to bring them back to normal, but for everything to go smoothly and without problems, patience was required, not for them, they were asleep - but for their Operators and the people dear to them.</p><br><p>Sure, some Phantom like Dahla, with similar abilities could make things go much faster, but that had risks and there was no hurry for them.</p><br><p>Adam and Fromund were seriously exhausted, not just injured, both mentally and physically. The powerful Phantom could heal their wounds and even partially remove their fatigue, but not the moral one.</p><br><br><p>Ten days later, at one point, two clicks sounded.</p><br><p>The green transparent liquid quickly went down, emptying the two healing pods, dropping the two young men to the ground.</p><br><p>The curved, sturdy panes of glass slowly opened, letting in the cold air beating against their still-wet bodies.</p><br><p>Slowly, Adam and Fromund opened their eyes, the darkness leisurely dispersed, letting in light, and soon the blurred picture became clear.</p><br><p>Taking their first steps after a long intoxicating sleep, they encountered a medium-height silhouette, not even noticing each other yet.</p><br><p>A middle-aged woman with blonde hair tied in a bun was staring at them, she wore a long white coat.</p><br><p>Feeling strangely awkward Adam and Fromund turned around to meet each other's gazes.</p><br><p>Before anything embarrassing could happen, two beige towels flew at them, long enough to cover everything necessary.</p><br><p>"Your treatment is complete, you have no idea how hard it was for me to get your eye back from under the burned flesh." The woman pointed at Adam.</p><br><p>"And attaching your arm back to your body when it lacks flesh! Damn! Is it so hard to fight by the rules? You're two Phantoms and not monsters after all."</p><br><p>The woman shook her head, her arms crossed over her chest.</p><br><p>Adam and Fromund looked at each other, they felt like students were being scolded by a teacher, and... it wasn't even their teacher but just someone random!</p><br><p>Then, the woman smiled weakly and pointed to a yellow door off to the side.</p><br><p>"There are your things lying there, they are updated and returned to their original state. Get dressed and go on through. Your loved ones are already waiting for you."</p><br><p>Then, the woman left returning to her work, leaving Adam and Fromund alone.</p><br><p>They said nothing, only smiled bitterly before heading towards the designated room.</p><br><p>"Brrrrh. It's so cold." Fromund muttered tightly clutching his shoulders.</p>
