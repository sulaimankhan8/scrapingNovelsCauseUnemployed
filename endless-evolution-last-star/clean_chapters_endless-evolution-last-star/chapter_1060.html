            <h4>Chapter 1060: Saegar, the Proud Wing (Part 1)</h4><br><p>Not a few minutes later, the great horse, with his master and the young Phantom, found themselves by the shore of a shining lake, a stark contrast to Kenward’s darkness.
</p><br><p>Adam turned around, looking at the dark dots in the distance. The wing warriors were rushing to catch up with them, but only Valdris succeeded, landing a few seconds later.
</p><br><p>"Agh... Agh... Agh... Mr. Kenward..."
</p><br><p>Valdris breathed heavily, collapsing to one knee. His wings shook like a runner’s legs after a long, torturous marathon.
</p><br><p>"Your speed is astonishing. I still have a long way to go to be a monster of your level..."
</p><br><p>"Naturally," Kenward calmly replied. "You’re not one of the Lords, there’s no way your strength can compare to mine. Though, from what I’ve heard, you’re doing well as an Elder."
</p><br><p>Valdris gulped, lowering his head. "Thank you... Your praise means a lot to me."
</p><br><br><p>Kenward climbed off his horse as he patted it on the neck several times.
</p><br><p>Tremble. Tremble. Tremble.
</p><br><p>With a slight shudder, the massive horse split into clots of darkness, turning into a long scarf around Kenward’s neck. At the Soaring Chain Islands, it was too warm for such attire, but that clearly didn’t bother Kenward.
</p><br><p>"Ouch!" Adam collapsed to the ground in surprise.
</p><br><p>"Come on, boy. It’s one thing to act cocky in front of ordinary monsters, but Saegar is one of the Lords. He deserves my attention and respect, especially from you." Kenward cast a stern look at Adam as he stepped forward.
</p><br><p>Adam nodded silently and followed Kenward.
</p><br><p>Whether he liked it or not, he was now at the complete mercy of the Kenward and the monsters of these lands.
</p><br><p>In fact, for Adam, there was little difference between Valdris and Kenward. If either of them became his enemies, he had no chance of survival.
</p><br><p>’Damn. Arnoth warned me about the Lords. He said that if I met them, I should run as fast as I could. But... It doesn’t look like I have that option.’
</p><br><p>Adam internally shook his head.
</p><br><p>He hadn’t just followed Kenward and relied on him as his temporary ally because of the situation with the First Star, but now he was about to face the second Lord.
</p><br><p>’Saegar... I hope we can come to an agreement with him. By the way, Silvana, did you manage to find any information on anything?’
</p><br><p>Adam knew that while he was passing through the lands and following the dark route, Silvana was making good use of that time.
</p><br><p>Sure, no matter how much he knew about Kenward or Saegar, it wouldn’t help him defeat them. But a lot of information could be used for more than just combat.
</p><br><p>’No. Unfortunately, I’ve had no luck finding out anything about them. Perhaps, I don’t have access, no... That’s most likely the case. Lords like the Second Rank Phantoms should be just a few. I doubt no one has ever encountered or even heard of Kenward, Rider of Darkness.’
</p><br><p>’I see... I’m starting to get used to it. Well, in that case, I’ll have to figure it all out for myself. The main thing is to make sure we don’t get into any trouble while negotiating.’
</p><br><p>Silvana bit her lip. She thought about it as well.
</p><br><p>’But, you won’t be able to participate in them in any way. I mean... You have nothing to offer to the monster of Saegar’s tier.’
</p><br><p>Adam shrugged inwardly.
</p><br><p>’Well, I’ll figure something out. From what I’ve learned about Saegar, he sounds like the kind of people I have a lot of experience with.’
</p><br><br><p>Gradually, Kenward, Adam and Valdris approached the entrance to the snow-white temple. White stone paths covered the ground with mowed grass, ornamental ponds sat at the corners while carved columns supported exquisitely decorated rings that transitioned into domes of various sizes.
</p><br><p>Adam’s eyes went wide when his eyes caught sight of several figures in the distance.
</p><br><p>Several girls in white and black outfits, were pouring particularly colorful flowers in an adorned flowerbed. Their small wings were folded at their backs and their eyes had the same vertical pupils as most monsters.
</p><br><p>’What the hell is going on here...? He doesn’t just have a mansion like some nobleman, but he has maids? Where am I?! At the Dark Shore or the mansion of the Twelve Branches family?’
</p><br><p>Adam’s reaction was more than predictable. Silvana also barely managed to lift her dropped jaw.
</p><br><p>They should have realized before it was too late that the Dark Shore was home to intelligent, wise and some ancient monsters and not bloodthirsty beasts driven only by the desire to devour flesh and absorb energy.
</p><br><p>But, something Adam realized.
</p><br><p>The stronger he became, the less difference he saw between monsters and humans.
</p><br><p>Would this pattern continue?
</p><br><p>Adam was sure it would.
</p><br><p>But... He didn’t know that monsters, unlike humans, evolved in two directions. Not all of them favored the human, or rather, the Crown Type form. Some monsters, especially among the ancient ones, were more than satisfied with the essence of their origin.
</p><br><p>However, Kenward and especially Saegar were not among them.
</p><br><br><p>After a few turns, they reached the main hall where a massive, round marble table awaited them under the glowing sunlight.
</p><br><p>As they entered, Valdris dropped to one knee, and the maids standing by the walls bowed low in respect for the important guest.
</p><br><p>At the table, on a couch among white, soft cushions, sat a young-looking man with one leg resting on the other. His aura showed that he had lived in this world for decades, but one could not give him more than 25.
</p><br><p>His spiky black hair came down over his pale face, while his amber eyes shone brightly. Loose, exquisite clothes covered his lean frame as he waved his hand in silent greeting.
</p><br><p>Silence hung for a while, waiting for Kenward to speak. It was a good start, they were received with all honors.
</p><br><p>Kenward nodded slightly. "Saegar, the Proud Wing. Long time no see."
</p><br><p>Then, Adam noticed two things that confused him.
</p><br><p>Saegar’s pupils were round, just like the humans, like Kenward’s, and... unlike all the other monsters at the Soaring Chain Islands, Saegar had no wings.</p>
