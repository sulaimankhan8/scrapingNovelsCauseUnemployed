            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1382: Fears of the Past</strong></p><br><br><p>After nearly half an hour, Adam climbed several thousand steps until he finally reached the very top of the gray tower.</p><br><p>“Agh… Agh… Agh…” Adam breathed heavily, holding onto his knees.</p><br><p>Normally, even for a K1-Phantom, this would not have been a problem. Ordinary people who were prepared for a long climb could have done it as well, not to mention a K4-Phantom like Adam.</p><br><p>He was just exhausted, both physically and mentally.</p><br><p>“Damn, I thought this staircase would never end!”</p><br><p>Adam shook his head and looked up at his reflection.</p><br><p>Instead of a door or passageway, there was a large mirror in front of him, dark with a silver frame.</p><br><p>“Is this the entrance to Bertrada? Tsk, I hope she doesn’t try to kill me?”</p><br><p>“Don’t worry about it,” Silvana said confidently. “She tried to do that when she had the chance. Now, all she can do is accept her defeat and send you back to the Forgotten Mill. I’m sure she’ll be glad to see this embarrassment come to an end.”</p><br><p>“Well, I agree with her on that. This island has been an interesting place, but I feel like I shouldn’t stay here too long.”</p><br><p>“Definitely. I still don’t know where we are, but if even a powerful artifact like the White Spire perished here, there were reasons for it.”</p><br><p>After a tense pause, Adam’s mood changed abruptly as he shrugged carelessly.</p><br><p>“I’ve already done everything here, almost. There’s only one last task left.”</p><br><p>Thus, Adam entered the mirror as darkness gave way to bright light.</p><br><p>The first thing he saw was distant waves covering the gloomy sea around the island, crashing into each other and rushing towards the shore.</p><br><p>Then, his gaze turned to Bertrada, who was sitting at a large table with one leg crossed over the other.</p><br><p>“Are you finally here? How long did I have to wait for you? Forever?” She grumbled with her arms crossed over her chest.</p><br><p>Adam snorted. “Pfffft! You think I wanted this? Who even built this staircase? It’s longer than my life!”</p><br><p>Bertrada frowned but didn’t continue.</p><br><p>“Come here and get your reward. As much as I don’t want to, you passed all the trials and then some. I hope this is our last meeting.” She pointed to a chair next to her.</p><br><p>However, Adam was in no hurry. Instead, he glanced at Mona, who was standing to the side, waiting for orders.</p><br><p>“Hi, Mona, good to see you. Only a few hours have passed, but it feels like several days.”</p><br><p>She nodded slightly.</p><br><p>“I’m glad you’re alive and have passed all the trials. It’s a rare occurrence.” Mona’s response was dry, but her gaze told Adam everything he needed to know.</p><br><p>Before heading to the table, he winked at her discreetly.</p><br><br><p>After a few quiet minutes, Mona brewed tea and filled Adam and Bertrada’s cups.</p><br><p>“Where do you get this tea? The aroma is incredible!” Adam exclaimed sincerely. “Maybe you buy it from someone in the Citadel, like Norax?”</p><br><p>As soon as Bertrada heard this, she rolled her eyes.</p><br><p>“Don’t be ridiculous. I’m not as crazy as that freak to trade with humans, especially here! The Tarnished Lands are full of rare herbs that can be used to make excellent tea, and this island is no exception.”</p><br><p>They took a sip each as Adam asked:</p><br><p>“So, how will this happen? Will you send me back and reward the Forgotten Mills?”</p><br><p>“That’s right, except for one detail. Usually, a contender must first receive the reward, but you did that before even reaching my domain. Tsk, I can feel your aura has grown. I’m sure you’re pleased with yourself.”</p><br><p>In response, Adam just shrugged and took another sip of tea.</p><br><p>“Anyway, I’m ready to send you back, but before that, I have to do something else.”</p><br><br><p>Bertrada snapped her fingers as a round hand mirror and a simple floating needle appeared next to her.</p><br><p>“Hmm? What’s this for?”</p><br><p>“With this mirror, energy, and your blood, I need to check your consciousness, specifically your greatest fear or tragedy in your past. It’s unique to each person. This is necessary to be sure that no one is controlling you from the outside.”</p><br><p>Adam raised an eyebrow in indignation.</p><br><p>“Hey! I’ve been through so much! How can you even think that someone is controlling me like some puppet! You probably just want to do this to draw my blood!”</p><br><br><p>Bertrada slammed her fist on the table with a great scowl.</p><br><p>“Do you think I want to do this? If it were up to me, I would have kicked you out of here a long time ago! I’m just following the rules, and for your information, there have been cases like this before!”</p><br><br><p>With a heavy sigh, Bertrada placed the mirror on the table and touched its edge.</p><br><p>“We have to hold the mirror at the same time. As soon as I draw your blood, touch the edge of the mirror, and just let me do my job. It will be easier for everyone.”</p><br><p>Adam quickly finished his tea and held out his hand. He understood that Bertrada would never do this of her own free will. After what had happened, he respected the rules of the White Spire to a certain extent.</p><br><br><br><p>The tip of the needle pierced his finger as the first drop of blood appeared. Without objection, Adam did as Bertrada said as she closed her eyes.</p><br><p>The mirror glowed brightly, receiving their energy and Adam’s blood, directing Bertrada’s vision into the depths of Adam’s mind.</p><br><p>After a few moments, Bertrada stopped as she saw a young man standing next to the dead Phantom, who was desperately fighting for his life against a wounded monster wielding silver threads.</p><br><p>“I see… You’re not as simple as I thought… Tell me, was this the monster whose power you were seeking here?” Bertrada asked seriously, slowly opening her eyes.</p><br><br><p>“Good. In that case, we are done, and—”</p><br><br><p>Without warning, Adam grabbed the needle and stabbed it right into Bertrada’s palm.</p><br><br><p>By the time Bertrada had a chance to react, Adam squeezed her bloody hand as they continued to hold the mirror, thus creating an unbreakable bond.</p><br><p>“Don’t worry. I just want to see your past as well. That’s only fair, isn’t it?”</p>
