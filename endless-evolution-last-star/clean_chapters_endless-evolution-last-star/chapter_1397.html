            <br><p><strong>Chapter 1397: Fight Club</strong></p><br><p>The fact that many monsters lived in Izardo did not mean that they were all friends or even allies. Everyone had to remain vigilant, and Helasa knew this well, especially when the unknown Phantom came to her.</p><br><p>However, as soon as Adam showed Norax’s token, the situation changed dramatically. The sole aura emanating from a drop of his blood was enough to make Reyla’s knees tremble and Helasa become truly serious.</p><br><p>Still, that wasn’t all.</p><br><p>Now, Helasa recognized Adam and wanted to hear his name:</p><br><br><p>The two words echoed in the room as the barrier prevented them from escaping, leaving her alone with Helasa and Reyla.</p><br><p>Izardo was located quite deep in the Tarnished Lands, as this was where the territory of the Renegades, the main force in this part of the world, began, but that did not prevent important news from reaching Izardo.</p><br><p>On the contrary, if something important happened in the world, the big monster cities were among the first to receive this information.</p><br><p>Naturally, the appearance of a new stellar Phantom, the one who, according to the powerful monsters and Phantoms, had a chance to become a Second Rank Phantom, was quite important news.</p><br><p>Thus, there was hardly a powerful monster in this world that was actively involved in activities who did not yet know about Adam.</p><br><p>This might seem like an exaggeration of his importance, since he was a K4-Phantom and posed no threat to many Elders, and especially Lords. This was not entirely true, because what was more important was the potential danger in the future, not the power Adam possessed now.</p><br><p>Moreover, those who were interested in his personality knew that just a year and a half ago, he was an ordinary person.</p><br><p>Considering that many Lords were several hundred or even thousands of years old, a year and a half was practically an instant for them. For them, Phantom Adam Vinter appeared as quickly as the sun after sunset.</p><br><p>“You… So this is what you look like,” Helasa muttered after a long pause.</p><br><p>Reyla said nothing, but she was clearly nervous as she began to bite her nails.</p><br><br><p>Not wanting to lose momentum, Adam placed the dark coin on the table and pushed it toward Helasa.</p><br><p>“Norax said you could help me with a problem. That’s why I went to Izardo and straight to you at the Raven Beak,” Adam said respectfully.</p><br><p>Before answering, Helasa shook her head and quickly downed a few cocktails. She needed to come to her senses to continue.</p><br><p>“I see… Hah, today is an interesting day.” Helasa smiled bitterly. “Norax remembered my existence, and Adam Vinter came to me.”</p><br><p>She looked away, at the city streets surrounding the Raven Beak below.</p><br><p>“You know, there are monsters in this city who wouldn’t mind taking a bounty on your head? I’m sure some fear your potential.”</p><br><p>Adam shrugged. He wasn’t surprised to hear this, as similar situations had already happened to him.</p><br><p>“I understand that. That’s why I haven’t told anyone my name, until now.”</p><br><p>“Good. That was the right decision.”</p><br><p>Helasa nodded and turned to Adam.</p><br><p>“So, Adam, tell me, what is it you want to talk to me about?”</p><br><p>Adam folded his hands together as he leaned forward.</p><br><p>“The Dark Heart. I need one.”</p><br><p>A sparkle flashed in Helasa’s eyes as Adam continued:</p><br><p>“It’s the last condition for me to evolve further, so it’s quite important to me, as you can understand. Norax said that his Hybrid acquaintances are too strong for me to have any chance against them, so he sent me to you.”</p><br><p>After a few moments, Helasa nodded. She knew that some Phantoms needed to defeat the Hybrids to become stronger. It was one of the conditions for their further evolution, albeit a rather rare one.</p><br><p>“Hmm… That’s not an easy request, even if you came to me from Norax and you have his token. Let’s start from the beginning. What type of Hybrids do you need to fight? Human Hybrids or Monster Hybrids?”</p><br><p>Adam already knew quite a lot about Hybrids after his conversation with Damien and Mariam. The Human Hybrids and Monster Hybrids differed both in their origin and in their numbers.</p><br><p>This was an important question for Helasa because if Adam said he needed to fight a Human Hybrid, finding the right opponent would be ten times more difficult. There were very few of them, even in their vast world.</p><br><p>“It doesn’t matter.” Adam waved his hand. “But… Since I’m a Phantom, I’d rather fight a Monster Hybrid than someone of my own race.”</p><br><p>Helasa’s lips curved upward. “Hah, your race? It seems you know a Human Hybrid, don’t you?”</p><br><p>There was no answer, but Helasa understood everything from Adam’s gaze.</p><br><p>“I’ll tell you that the Hybrids are quite different from both monsters and Phantoms. However, right now we are sitting at the same table discussing how best for you to hunt a Hybrid, even though you are a Phantom, and I am a monster. Anything is possible in this world.”</p><br><p>Then, Helasa took a sip of her cocktail as Adam remembered something.</p><br><p>“There’s one question I’d like to ask.” Adam scratched the back of his head. “When I was at the Forgotten Mills, I went there to get the Connected Heart. Initially, I thought I would have to kill a monster, but in the end, it all ended with the String Duel. What about the Dark Heart?”</p><br><p>Helasa raised an eyebrow.</p><br><p>“You want to know if you need to kill the Hybrid or if there’s another option?”</p><br><p>“Pretty much, yeah.” Adam shrugged. “If I have to, I’ll kill one, but if it’s a battle, I’ll accept those rules as well. Like I said before, my goal is the Dark Heart, and I just want to get it in the fastest and most efficient way possible.”</p><br><p>“Hmm… Let me think about it.”</p><br><p>Soon, Helasa smiled slyly and looked at Adam. She had an idea.</p><br><p>“How about a fight club?” She suggested, waiting for his reaction.</p><br><br><p>Adam tilted his head.</p><br>
