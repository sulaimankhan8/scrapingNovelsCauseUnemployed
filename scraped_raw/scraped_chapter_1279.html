Although Audrey had long learned about the prophecy of the apocalypse from the Church of Knowledge and Wisdom demigod, she never found it corporeal enough, feeling that it was meant to deceive the people.
</p><br><p>Even though she had already slightly experienced a war where the individual was puny, she didn’t believe that the world was just about a decade away from the apocalypse.
</p><br><p>There were no signs of this at all!
</p><br><p>However, the person who had given the apocalyptic prophecy was Mr. Fool’s Blessed, Mr. World, who had always been trustworthy and daring to strike at angels. Furthermore, his tone was firm, as though he had already seen what was about to happen a decade later.
</p><br><p>This made Audrey choose to instinctively believe him. Her heart sank as she felt nervous and flustered.
</p><br><p>Apart from that, she also felt her confusion fade significantly—there was still another decade before the end of the world. Even those who were drowning would struggle a little, much less a perfectly fine Sequence 4 demigod.
</p><br><p>Apocalypse... As a cardinal of the Church of Storms, Alger had recently seen many apocalyptic prophecies, but those unverifiable matters couldn’t compare to The World Gehrman Sparrow’s abnormally serious warning. The impact brought by the two sources wasn’t on the same level.
</p><br><p>At the same time, he acutely noticed a detail—the World said that even deities would be destroyed.
</p><br><p>Alger’s first reaction was that Gehrman Sparrow was being disrespectful to Mr. Fool, as Mr. Fool was also a deity.
</p><br><p>However, he quickly rejected this idea. After all, The World Gehrman Sparrow was Mr. Fool’s Blessed and was the most devout believer. The other members of the Tarot Club might accidentally blaspheme Mr. Fool, but it was impossible for The World Gehrman Sparrow.
</p><br><p>Due to the two prerequisites that “Gehrman Sparrow wouldn’t be disrespectful to Mr. Fool” and “him saying that even deities would be destroyed,” Alger quickly came to another conclusion:
</p><br><p>In The World’s Gehrman Sparrow’s heart, Mr. Fool’s level was higher than that of a true deity!
</p><br><p>This... Alger never doubted The World Gehrman Sparrow’s knowledge; after all, he was a powerhouse who often interacted with angels.
</p><br><p>This knowledge made him both shocked and puzzled, momentarily unable to find an even more reasonable explanation.
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "68523d6f4f9baf3f067b654a", id: "pf-15550-1"})</script></div><br><p>Having used the blood of a Snake of Fate to advance to the level of a demigod, Cattleya would also occasionally dream of the scene of the dawn of the apocalypse thanks to her pathway having Clairvoyant as its Sequence 3. In addition, Queen Mystic Bernadette would occasionally remind her, so she didn’t feel any surprise or shock regarding Mr. World’s words. She just felt like the dust that had been stirred had finally landed on the ground.
</p><br><p>As for the future, this Mysticologist was equally lost. Apart from improving herself, she didn’t know where to direct her efforts.
</p><br><p>Apocalypse... Xio and Fors looked at each other across Ma’am Hermit and sensed the raging upheavals in each other’s hearts.
</p><br><p>They had never thought that the wonderful life they were living wouldn’t last more than two decades unless something happened.
</p><br><p>This was a time where they were in their prime. Even if they weren’t demigods, they didn’t have to worry about the inclination towards losing control due to their aging bodies.
</p><br><p>As the person who spoke was The World Gehrman Sparrow, the two ladies didn’t suspect the authenticity of the prophecy. They momentarily felt fearful and heavy.
</p><br><p>At the beginning, Derrick couldn’t help but feel depressed. This was because the City of Silver had just left the Forsaken Land of the Gods and came to the world of light. Yet, none of this would last long before the apocalypse was ushered in.
</p><br><p>Soon, he composed himself and chose to believe in Mr. Fool.
</p><br><p>Since this great existence was able to rescue the City of Silver from the Forsaken Land of the Gods, “He” too could also stop the apocalypse.
</p><br><p>Although I’m the savior of the Sanguine during the apocalypse, I never expected it to happen so soon... I’m only an Earl... Emlyn couldn’t help but frown. It was as though a student who had just attended a few days of lessons had to suddenly sit an exam.
</p><br><p>Of course, this also made him excited. After all, it wouldn’t be long before he would fulfill his mission and display his greatness in front of his fellow kinsmen.
</p><br><p>Leonard had heard of the doomsday prophecy from Old Man Pallez Zoroast. Although he didn’t know the reason behind such a development, he had long been mentally prepared. At this moment, he was the first to snap back to his senses and asked, “Why would the apocalypse suddenly happen? There are no signs of it...”
</p><br><p>Klein controlled The World to reply:
</p><br><p>“It’s just that you didn’t notice the signs.
</p><br><p>“Do you think that a battle of gods erupted for no reason?”
</p><br><p>Seeing that all the members of the Tarot Club were stunned and lost in thought, The World Gehrman Sparrow added, “You aren’t qualified to know the exact reason. Just understanding it would bring about an irrepressible corruption. Only angels and above can resist it.”
</p><br><p>This is similar to what the demigod from the Church of Knowledge’s demigod said... It’s close to the corruption from the cosmos... I seem to have forgotten something... Mr. World seems to have figured out the whole story... Isn’t he afraid of being corrupted? H-he’s already an angel? He is now a “He”? Thoughts flashed through Audrey’s mind as she acutely sensed that The World Gehrman Sparrow might’ve completed his advancement and become a true Mythical Creature.
</p><br><p>In ancient times, this could even be called a subsidiary god, a member of the deity lineup!
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "68523d7a4f9baf3f067b6572", id: "pf-15551-1"})</script></div><br><p>Right on the heels of that, Alger, Cattleya, and the other members of the Tarot Club understood the truth. They knew that The World Gehrman Sparrow had already reached the top of the real world, becoming an angel that walked the land.
</p><br><p>Their guesses were related to Gehrman Sparrow’s plan to deal with a Mythical Creature. Some believed that it was the benefits that Mr. Fool’s recovery gave to “His” Blessed.
</p><br><p>But no matter what, it was the first time the Tarot Club had a member at the level of an angel, aside from its host and convener!
</p><br><p>Of course, they weren’t too surprised by The World Gehrman Sparrow’s advancement to Sequence 2. They had long been numb to his progression rate.
</p><br><p>Klein controlled The World and made him look around.
</p><br><p>“You can think about what you plan to do next and how you would go about doing it.”
</p><br><p>Xio, Fors, and the other Tarot Club members nodded slightly as acknowledgment.
</p><br><p>Another ten minutes of free exchange followed before this session of the Tarot Gathering gradually came to an end.
</p><br><p>...
</p><br><p>After returning to the real world, Xio surveyed her bedroom. Her expression slowly turned solemn.
</p><br><p>She once again felt a pressing sense of urgency.
</p><br><p>After walking out of the room, Xio saw that Fors had also walked out to the corridor at the same time. She no longer suffered from momentary paralysis before coming out.
</p><br><p>“Where do you plan on going?” Both of them asked in unison before falling silent.
</p><br><p>A few seconds later, a handsome young man walked out of the guest room. He wore a pair of narrow-framed spectacles and had slightly fluffy hair. He held a few thick books in both hands.
</p><br><p>“Oh no, I forgot that I have classes this afternoon!” The youth mumbled to himself as he rushed towards the staircase, completely ignoring the presence of the two ladies.
</p><br><p>He was Xio’s younger brother, Rio Derecha. He had just entered a pre-law school.
</p><br><p>In Backlund, one had to pass a pre-law examination before becoming a paralegal. Such a paralegal had to study and work for at least five years under a full lawyer before one was allowed to take part in the qualification examination and get a license to practice law.
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "685267864f9baf3f067b8f34", id: "pf-15559-1"})</script></div><br><p>If one wanted to become a senior lawyer, one had to enter the Backlund Lawyer School to receive university-level education.
</p><br><p>Xio watched her little brother run down the stairs, and a smile subconsciously appeared on her face.
</p><br><p>She immediately looked up and said to Fors, “I plan to return to MI9 and work hard.”
</p><br><p>“I plan on making a trip to Teacher’s place,” Fors answered the question.
</p><br><p>Right on the heels of that, the Traveler’s figure quickly turned transparent and vanished.
</p><br><p>A few seconds later, Fors appeared at a relatively intact building in the rebuilding Pritz Harbor.
</p><br><p>Then, she took out a pen and paper from her pocket and wrote a note. She planned on telling her teacher that she had finished digesting the Traveler potion.
</p><br><p>Putting away the fountain pen, she stuffed the paper into the mailbox at the door.
</p><br><p>This wasn’t Dorian Gray Abraham’s residence. It was the place where Fors and the gentleman had previously agreed to send letters to.
</p><br><p>The next day, when Fors arrived, she saw Dorian providing her with the meeting location and time.
</p><br><p>...
</p><br><p>Emlyn opened his eyes in his room and changed into his coat with a standing collar, intending to visit Marquis Nibbs.
</p><br><p>When the carriage passed Rose Street, he subconsciously looked out the window and was somewhat surprised to discover that the door to the Harvest Church had opened.
</p><br><p>After a brief hesitation, he got the carriage driver to stop the carriage, and he paid for the ride.
</p><br><p>After putting on his top hat and holding his cane, the red-eyed Sanguine Earl walked up the steps and entered the Harvest Church. He saw Father Utravsky, who seemed to have grown a little taller, cleaning the prayer hall with his back hunched.
</p><br><p>He has been released as expected... It really was protective custody... Emlyn shook his head inwardly.
</p><br><p>At this moment, Father Utravsky raised his head and looked at him.
</p><br><p>“Wipe the candle stand.”
</p><br><p>...I’m trying to please Mother Goddess, Emlyn mumbled. He walked to the room behind him, changed into the brown priest robe of the Church of Earth Mother, and began working.
</p><br><p>Neither of them spoke a word. They did their own jobs and tried their best to restore the Harvest Church to its former cleanliness and tranquility.
</p><br><p>After an unknown period of time, a group of people suddenly entered the door.
</p><br><p>Emlyn subconsciously looked over and saw Baron Cosmi Odora. He saw Viscount Ernes Boyar, who had once “worked” at the Harvest Church, and many familiar faces.
</p><br><p>Emlyn’s lips subconsciously curled up.</p>
