Every part of his body was charred black, completely drained of its blood.
</p><br><p>Amongst them, something fell out of his black-robe ashes. It was a normal-sized palm. Its skin’s texture didn’t appear human at all, and it had a dim luster. Its fingers were slender with balanced amounts of flesh and bone.
</p><br><p>If he hadn’t seen it on such an occasion, Emlyn definitely would’ve believed that the palm was a part of an exquisite doll.
</p><br><p>Another head in Reinette Tinekerr’s hand swung forward as it quickly bit the palm.
</p><br><p>At the same time, Sharron’s figure turned incorporeal as she entered the remains of Shaman King Klarman, speeding up the expelling of his Beyonder characteristic.
</p><br><p>Emlyn composed himself and looked at the Door of Summoning created by Lilith’s Ring. His body suddenly turned into a hazy moonlight.
</p><br><p>The crimson moonlight shattered into countless fragments of light.
</p><br><p>The bright and devilish red scales swam around the area enveloped by the moonlight, restructuring beside Klarman’s corpse into Emlyn White in his tuxedo and bowtie.
</p><br><p>Without looking at the Beyonder characteristic that had seeped out, he dispelled the Unshadowed Crucifix, bent down, and picked up the Vision of White that he had previously thrown to the side using his black velvet glove.
</p><br><p>His other hand shook Leymano’s Travels as he flipped the book to one of the pages. The symbols and mysterious patterns on it all belonged to “Traveling.”
</p><br><p>Emlyn’s figure turned transparent as he vanished from the scene.
</p><br><p>He followed the plan and was the first to leave after the operation ended. He didn’t interfere with Sharron and company’s cleanup of the scene and their clearing of traces. After all, he was the weakest one there. He had used up a considerable amount of energy in battle while relying on the Sealed Artifacts and mystical items.
</p><br><p>As for the spoils of war, they would be distributed once they returned to Backlund.
</p><br><p>In this aspect, Emlyn fully believed in Gehrman Sparrow’s promise and the Rose School of Thought’s temperance department’s credit.
</p><br><p>After “Teleporting” back to an empty house in Backlund, he suddenly threw down Leymano’s Travels. He took out a bronze box with many red gems embedded in it, and he placed the Vision of White inside.
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "68523d6f4f9baf3f067b654a", id: "pf-15550-1"})</script></div><br><p>Only after doing this did Emlyn have the energy to take off the glove on his left hand. He saw that his fingers were filled with blisters, swollen.
</p><br><p>With the Sanguine’s regenerative ability, damage at such a level should’ve long been healed, but in reality, it hadn’t improved at all.
</p><br><p>The burns brought by the Vision of White will last at least seven days. Emlyn took out ointment he had stored in a metal tube and squeezed out some of it to apply it on his wound.
</p><br><p>The soul-stabbing pain was immediately eased by the cooling sensation. Emlyn slowly exhaled as though he had finally resurrected.
</p><br><p>He had used a great deal of willpower to restrain himself from throwing the Vision of White onto the ground. This was because once the Sealed Artifact left his control, it would automatically absorb the light around it and emit a radiant glow. To a Sanguine, this was an excellent way of committing suicide.
</p><br><p>Right on the heels of that, Emlyn took out a bottle of his blood that he had extracted beforehand and smeared it on the surface of Leymano’s Travels. Then, he drank another bottle of blood to ease the bloodthirst that Lilith’s Ring brought about.
</p><br><p>After such an operation, he finally removed the negative effects the Sealed Artifact had on him.
</p><br><p>Only at this moment did Emlyn have the time to recall the accident that had happened during the battle.
</p><br><p>The Door of Summoning that he projected with Lilith’s Ring didn’t summon creatures from deep in the spirit world, but he ended up summoning a strange moon.
</p><br><p>The moon hung behind the Door of Summoning and silently illuminated Shaman King Klarman, suppressing the various Beyonder powers that belonged to the Moon domain.
</p><br><p>If not for this change, even if Lilith’s Ring had summoned a saint-level spirit world creature, the battle wouldn’t have ended so quickly. Perhaps they would have had to wait until the Rose School of Thought temperance angel descended to gain an overwhelming advantage.
</p><br><p>...A silvery-white moon... Could it be that the Ancestor had provided me with some help? Emlyn had a thought and made a corresponding guess.
</p><br><p>This matched the identity of the Sanguine savior that the Ancestor had appointed.
</p><br><p>After careful consideration, Emlyn no longer had any doubts about this guess, but unlike the past, he wasn’t that excited or thrilled.
</p><br><p>After experiencing a battle at the demigod level and confirming that he was shouldering such an important responsibility, he felt no sense of pride. His heart was heavy from the pressure.
</p><br><p>Phew... A few seconds later, Emlyn opened his mouth and whispered, “I’m the savior of the Sanguine.”
</p><br><p>When he said this, his expression was abnormally solemn, somewhat dignified, without any hesitation.
</p><br><p>...
</p><br><p>In the house where Emlyn met Maric and Sharron.
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "68523d7a4f9baf3f067b6572", id: "pf-15551-1"})</script></div><br><p>When the Sanguine saw the perfect doll-like lady take out two items, he heard her slightly ethereal voice say, “According to the agreement, we will only take one thing. This is the rest.”
</p><br><p>The two items were:
</p><br><p>A fist-sized gem condensed from thick blood. It emitted a crimson glow, like a miniature crimson moon. The other item was an exquisite male doll with two black holes as its eyes.
</p><br><p>Shaman King’s Beyonder characteristic... General of the Pupil-less Eye... Emlyn nodded and saw that the two items seemed to have a life of their own as they flew over.
</p><br><p>Just as he reached out to catch it, he heard Miss Sharron add, “The Shaman King Beyonder characteristic has some strange traces of corruption. Even the Unshadowed Spear was unable to cleanse it.”
</p><br><p>It means that I need to find an angel to help me shatter it to remove the corruption? Emlyn completely understood what Sharron was saying as he nodded slightly.
</p><br><p>“I understand what to do.”
</p><br><p>Sharron, who was wearing a small black bonnet, immediately floated up and gave a curtsy.
</p><br><p>“Thank you for your help.”
</p><br><p>“Likewise.” Emlyn took off his hat and bowed in return.
</p><br><p>...
</p><br><p>Above the grayish-white fog, inside the ancient palace.
</p><br><p>Klein looked at the wisps of black gas emanating from his body, shook his head, and sighed.
</p><br><p>I actually got cursed by the Abomination without realizing it... The projection of the Chained God could be the culprit as well...
</p><br><p>I was even separated by a historical projection...
</p><br><p>If it were any saint without Sefirah Castle, they would probably experience a sudden death after thinking they were safe.
</p><br><p>As for Miss Messenger, there wasn’t much of a problem even without the historical projection in between because “She” was a real angel. Therefore, Klein wasn’t worried.
</p><br><p>After the black gas dissipated, Klein waited for a while. He waited until Emlyn sacrificed the items and requested Mr. Fool to help purify the Shaman King Beyonder characteristic.
</p><br><p>Strange corruption... From the Mother Tree of Desire or the Primordial Moon? Klein picked up the miniature crimson moon and carefully observed it for a few seconds.
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "685267864f9baf3f067b8f34", id: "pf-15559-1"})</script></div><br><p>During this process, he was on high alert, constantly preparing to mobilize Sefirah Castle’s powers.
</p><br><p>If he wasn’t at the level of an angel level here, he wouldn’t have agreed to Emlyn’s sacrifice. Instead, he would’ve chosen to smite down with power at the Sequence 2 level, shattering the characteristic and separating the corruption remotely.
</p><br><p>Back then, Klein didn’t even dare to divine the Werewolf Beyonder characteristic that had been slightly influenced by the Mother Tree of Desire. He had even hurriedly sold it.
</p><br><p>After examining it seriously, Klein pressed his right hand, causing the entire mysterious space to vibrate.
</p><br><p>The miniature crimson moon shattered with a crack, splitting into tiny red dots of light.
</p><br><p>Amongst these light dots, there was a small amount of red mist that evaporated, eventually forming a drop of fresh blood.
</p><br><p>Then, the red light dots gathered again, constantly condensing before transforming into the miniature crimson moon. However, compared to before, it was more translucent and pure.
</p><br><p>Klein conjured a fake hand, picked up the drop of seemingly fresh blood, and discovered that it contained immense vitality.
</p><br><p>It’s not at the angel level, but it’s a little strange... It seems to have received an evil god’s blessings... As Klein cut off all the invisible connections that resulted from the blood, he took a paper figurine and attempted to press the drop of blood onto it.
</p><br><p>The moment the blood came into contact with the paper figurine, it immediately seeped in. In the next second, the paper figurine’s stomach strangely bulged and exploded.
</p><br><p>At the moment the paper figurine tore apart, a new paper figurine with a hint of crimson crawled out from its stomach. It seemed to have fully-developed features.
</p><br><p>The power of reproduction... Klein frowned slightly as he stabbed with his right hand, reducing the newly born paper figurine into powder.
</p><br><p>A tiny amount of blood-colored mist emanated again, condensing into a drop of blood.
</p><br><p>The characteristic and spirituality were only slightly weakened... It needs to be repeated more than a hundred times before it can be completely removed... Klein silently assessed as he gathered the powers of Sefirah Castle to seal the drop of blood.
</p><br><p>He then looked up and cast his gaze at the male doll on the long mottled table.
</p><br><p>The palm-sized doll in a formal suit was prostrating; it didn’t dare to look up.
</p><br><p>Oh, how easy is it to deal with those with living characteristics... Klein chuckled as he gathered the sealed drop of blood and brought it close towards the doll named General of the Pupil-less Eye.
</p><br><p>General of the Pupil-less Eye pushed itself up with all four limbs and quickly retreated.
</p><br><p>After a pause, it pressed its forehead against the table, emitting a sound indecipherable to humans.
</p><br><p>“Declaring your subservience? Very good...” Klein replied with a smile and casually instructed, “Show me your abilities.”
</p><br><p>After a series of demonstrations, he confirmed that General of the Pupil-less Eye could possess a target and affect lifeless items. It also had some level of control over mystical items that no one possessed or had spirituality injected into.
</p><br><p>The latter power might be very useful at certain times... Klein nodded slightly and beckoned for it to jump into a box he conjured.
</p><br><p>After carefully sealing it, Klein threw the box and the drop of blood into the junk pile to let them familiarize themselves with their future lives.
</p><br><p>As for the negative effects of General of the Pupil-less Eye, Klein believed that they could discuss and resolve it amicably and normally.</p>
