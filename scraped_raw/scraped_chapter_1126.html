</p><br><p>He lit the candles and burned the corresponding essential oils and herbal powder, took two steps back, and skillfully recited the honorific name of the Goddess. Finally, he said, “I sacrifice this cane filled with life to you. I’m willing to receive your blessings.”
</p><br><p>He didn’t directly mention the Demonic Wolf of Fog’s transformed heart and White Frost Crystal. This was equivalent to making an equivalent exchange, not offering sacrificial items and praying for a bestowment.
</p><br><p>There was no need to be too meticulous in other aspects of the ritual, but this was a case of showing his attitude at a fundamental level. He felt that he needed to be careful.
</p><br><p>When Klein finished his sentence, two out of the three candle flames swelled and intertwined, forming an illusory and dark mysterious door.
</p><br><p>The door slowly opened, creating strong invisible winds.
</p><br><p>They swept up the Life’s Cane, allowing it to disappear into the seemingly endless cosmos through the gap of the illusory door.
</p><br><p>Immediately following that, there was a flash as two items tore through the barrier and landed on the altar without making a single sound.
</p><br><p>One of them was a strange heart formed by wisps of white mist, and the other was crystalline frost that emitted cold air.
</p><br><p>Klein was delighted as he hurriedly lowered his head to thank the Goddess for her bestowment.
</p><br><p>When he raised his head again, the dark and mysterious door had closed. It rapidly faded away, and the altar was completely restored to normal.
</p><br><p>Phew, it really succeeded... Klein heaved a sigh of relief and took two steps forward, putting away the Demonic Wolf of Fog’s transformed heart and White Frost Crystal.
</p><br><p>At this moment, the relaxed him couldn’t help but have a thought that he absolutely couldn’t say out loud.
</p><br><p>If I had known that it would go so smoothly, I wouldn’t have had to use my Life’s Cane...
</p><br><p>That huge junk pile might’ve been enough...
</p><br><p>Perhaps I didn’t need to sacrifice anything, and the Goddess would’ve bestowed them to me. The present situation indicates that “She” is personally supporting me becoming a Scholar of Yore...
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "68523d6f4f9baf3f067b654a", id: "pf-15550-1"})</script></div><br><p>Of course, this way, if I receive too many bestowments, who knows what price I’ll pay in the future. Using Life’s Cane to trade for it makes me feel more at ease...
</p><br><p>Well, from the looks of it, before advancing to Sequence 2 and becoming an angel, the Goddess will still shower “Her” blessings on me. In the future, it will be hard to tell what kind of developments and changes will happen...
</p><br><p>With this in mind, he reined in his thoughts, ended the ritual, and tidied up the altar.
</p><br><p>Then, he began to plan on how to deal with the Hounds of Fulgrim, the so-called “Sefirah Castle Keepers.”
</p><br><p>A Magician never performs unprepared!
</p><br><p>South of the Bridge, Rose Street.
</p><br><p>Leonard changed into a black-and-white police uniform and wore a “red glove.” He led his team members and the real policemen to the only cathedral of the Church of Earth Mother in Backlund.
</p><br><p>The epaulets he was wearing corresponded to a high-ranking inspector. But in fact, with his status as a captain of a Red Gloves team, he should be equivalent to a superintendent or even a chief superintendent. However, officers at that rank wouldn’t involve themselves in such missions. Wearing those epaulets to the Harvest Church would easily arouse the suspicion of the public.
</p><br><p>After passing through the door, Leonard scanned the area and realized that it was empty. There were only two figures. One was sitting in the front pew, focused on praying. The second was the handsome man dressed in a priest’s robes.
</p><br><p>He had black hair and red eyes.
</p><br><p>Emlyn White... Leonard nodded secretly as he walked down the aisle to Bishop Utravsky.
</p><br><p>He then coughed twice, making the half-giant bishop open his eyes and look over.
</p><br><p>“I’m an inspector from the Backlund Police Department.” Leonard showed his identification and said, “We would like to invite you back to assist in our investigations.”
</p><br><p>Father Utravsky stood up slowly and asked in a calm tone despite looking down at him, “What’s the matter?”
</p><br><p>The nearby residents reported your abnormal behavior, saying that it’s possible that you’re a spy for Feysac or Feynapotter.” Leonard explained the reason he had long come up with.
</p><br><p>At the same time, he was prepared to pull Bishop Utravsky into a dream at any moment. Once he resisted, he would try to control this Blessed in the shortest time possible.
</p><br><p>With the Red Gloves team’s distribution, as long as they didn’t directly encounter a true demigod, even if they were to face a Blessed who was in charge of a Holy Artifact, they would have a good chance of taking down their opponent.
</p><br><p>Furthermore, before Leonard set off, he had applied for a Grade 1 Sealed Artifact. This was also the reason why he had delayed taking action until today.
</p><br><p>Father Utravsky fell silent for two seconds before turning to look at Emlyn White, who was standing by the candle stand.
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "68523d7a4f9baf3f067b6572", id: "pf-15551-1"})</script></div><br><p>Emlyn’s slightly complicated expression froze. He opened his mouth, but didn’t know what to say.
</p><br><p>Father Utravsky retracted his gaze and nodded slightly.
</p><br><p>“Okay.”
</p><br><p>...So cooperative? I thought we would experience an intense battle and that we had to be very careful not to cause any casualties... Leonard was taken aback before he smiled.
</p><br><p>Thank you for your cooperation.”
</p><br><p>If there really was a battle that ended up harming a Blessed of Earth Mother, Leonard suspected that the tense situation would rapidly be aggravated.
</p><br><p>Through the ancient history in Groselle’s Travels and the various secrets he learned from the Tarot Club, and the corresponding explanations of Old Man Pallez, Leonard knew that the relationship between the Church of Earth Mother and the Church of Evernight was like dried timber. It could be ignited with a tiny spark. When the time came, the history books would record today’s events.
</p><br><p>The war would go from a localized problem to a fuse that ignited the globe!
</p><br><p>Leonard Mitchell had lit a religious gunpowder keg!
</p><br><p>Phew... Seeing that Father Utravsky didn’t resist and accepted the “protective custody,” Emlyn White secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He was very satisfied with his performance at the Tarot Club.
</p><br><p>At this moment, the Red Gloves team member, Cindy, looked at Emlyn, who lacked a level of masculinity due to the gentleness of the soft moonlight. She lowered her voice and said, “Cap, uh, Sir, there’s still a priest. Should we take him with us? Yes, we can temporarily shut down the Harvest Church for some time to prevent any accidents from happening.”
</p><br><p>Emlyn:
</p><br><p>Leonard:
</p><br><p>After a few seconds and repeated deliberation, Leonard finally said, “If the spy case involves Feynapotter, he would also be considered a suspect. Let’s invite him back to assist in our investigations.”
</p><br><p>Emlyn was stunned, unsure of what expression to show in response.
</p><br><p>East Borough, in a two-bedroom rental apartment.
</p><br><p>Fors rubbed her dark eye circles and drank the last mouthful of bitter coffee. She stood up abruptly and began changing her clothes.
</p><br><p>“Done writing?” Xio, who was enjoying her breakfast, was taken aback.
</p><br><p>It had only been a day and a half!
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "685267864f9baf3f067b8f34", id: "pf-15559-1"})</script></div><br><p>Fors shook her head and took a deep breath.
</p><br><p>“No.
</p><br><p>“But I’ve already written the first volume. I can hand it over to the editor of the publisher. If it’s serialized, there’s no need to finish it all now.”
</p><br><p>Xio thought and said, “This is indeed a good idea. It can effectively reduce your stress.”
</p><br><p>Fors’s expression twisted as she closed her eyes.
</p><br><p>“I hope so...”
</p><br><p>In another rental apartment a few streets away, after a series of tasks, Klein, who had come up with a plan and made his preparations, put on Creeping Hunger and quickly turned transparent as he entered the spirit world.
</p><br><p>Looking up, he saw the seven pure lights that comprised of seven different colors. He released the arms of his two marionettes and took out a box. He removed the wall of spirituality around it, allowing the aura of the Demonic Wolf of Fog’s transformed heart to emanate from it.
</p><br><p>Then, he pulled Enuni while Enuni pulled Qonas. Together, the three of them rapidly teleported deep into the spirit world.
</p><br><p>Along the way, all kinds of strange spirit world creatures passed by them like oil paintings that depicted hell.
</p><br><p>After an unknown period of time, Klein’s premonition for danger suddenly stirred as a scene quickly appeared in his mind:
</p><br><p>Red, black, white, blue, and other colors saturated and overlapped as a slender figure suddenly appeared.
</p><br><p>It looked like a hound. Its entire body was covered in black short fur, and its eye sockets were two balls of dark-red burning flames. The ends of its mouth extended to the back of its head. It clearly existed there in its corporal form, but it gave off an illusory feeling that felt surreal.
</p><br><p>Hound of Fulgrim!
</p><br><p>Klein immediately turned around and faced it.
</p><br><p>He released his two marionettes at the same time, allowing them to wander in different directions.
</p><br><p>In the blink of an eye, the Hound of Fulgrim appeared.
</p><br><p>The two dark red flames, which weren’t too deformed but were absolutely terrifying, turned and looked at Klein.
</p><br><p>Right on the heels of that, its figure became more and more illusory. It instantly disappeared, as though it was a projection from history.
</p><br><p>...It ran away just like that? As Klein muttered to himself in shock, he became even more wary of the possibility of a surprise attack.
</p><br><p>More than ten seconds later, two figures phased into existence. They were covered in black fur, their eyes burning, and the corners of their lips extended to the back of their heads.
</p><br><p>However, there was only one dark red flame left in the eye sockets of each of the two monsters. The remaining fireballs were in their paws.
</p><br><p>Without waiting for Klein to react, the two Hounds of Fulgrim lay down in the void of the spirit world and wagged their tails.
</p><br><p>They wagged their tails.
</p><br><p>Klein’s mouth was agape, wondering if he was dreaming.</p>
