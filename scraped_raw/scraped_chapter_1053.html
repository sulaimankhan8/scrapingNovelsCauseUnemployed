</p><br><p>The despair in the incomplete grayish-white dragon’s eyes dissipated as it retracted its skin-covered wings, behaving like a docile hunting dog reared at home.
</p><br><p>The Psychology Alchemists councilor, demigod of the Spectator pathway, Hvin Rambis, had lost his life and became Klein’s marionette!
</p><br><p>Without bothering to enjoy this achievement, he switched places with Enuni, who was beside the grayish-white dragon, appearing as Gehrman Sparrow in his black trench coat and silk top hat.
</p><br><p>Then, he controlled his new marionette to treat the infection he received from Mental Plague.
</p><br><p>A gentle and cool breeze swept past the sea of collective subconscious, seeping into Klein’s island of consciousness. It made him feel like the object reeking of a rotten, putrid, and discordant object in his Body of Heart and Mind was being purged out of him with a surgical knife.
</p><br><p>Klein’s face immediately contorted as he grimaced. He once again felt the excruciating pain in his soul.
</p><br><p>Thankfully, in order to create the Control Spirit Bullets and the Yesterday Once More charms, he was already accustomed to this feeling. He didn’t hold his head and roll around.
</p><br><p>After purging the contagious mental disease from his consciousness, the cool wind brought about a warmth that made him want to take an afternoon nap. It allowed his damaged Spirit Body to relax as if he was soaked in a bath. His mind and body quickly recovered thanks to the nourishment.
</p><br><p>By the time he recovered from his mental disease, the gentle breeze that blew at him became intense. It swept the surroundings, wiping out all the “contagion” left in the air.
</p><br><p>After doing all of this, Klein made the grayish-white dragon rapidly shrink its body, converge its godhood, and turn back into its human form.
</p><br><p>However, as Hvin Rambis’ clothes had been ripped to pieces, the gray scales on his body didn’t disappear.
</p><br><p>A few seconds later, the ascetic leader of the Church of Evernight, Arianna walked out of the gigantic crimson moon in her simple robe and belt made of tree bark. Her long black hair cascaded down as she stepped across the void and arrived diagonally above Hvin Rambis.
</p><br><p>The angel stretched out “Her” right hand and, with a gentle squeeze, let Hvin Rambis’s blurry soul leave his body and float above his head.
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "68523d6f4f9baf3f067b654a", id: "pf-15550-1"})</script></div><br><p>“Why are you helping George III?” Arianna asked directly.
</p><br><p>Hvin Rambis’s confused expression immediately turned serious.
</p><br><p>“This is the choice of the times, an inevitability of destiny. We are just following the flow of the tides and providing some guidance, allowing the times to develop in the right direction.”
</p><br><p>The standard answer of the Twilight Hermit Order... From the looks of it, the Psychology Alchemists’ demigod doesn’t know what Adam’s true goal is either... Even as official members of the Twilight Hermit Order, most of them probably don’t know... Klein didn’t have any problems thinking thanks to his situation inside the concealed world.
</p><br><p>Arianna didn’t show any surprise as she pressed, “What is the trend of the times?”
</p><br><p>Hvin Rambis’s eyes were unfocused, but his expression was solemn as he answered, “A war, one that will sweep the entire world.”
</p><br><p>This... Isn’t peace nice? Klein frowned slightly as he couldn’t help but mumble inwardly.
</p><br><p>He knew very well what a world war would do to humans.
</p><br><p>He only wished that his investigation with the Church of Evemight would be able to seize the key and successfully prevent the war which the Twilight Hermit Order was strongly pushing from erupting.
</p><br><p>Arianna fell silent for a second before asking, “What’s the secret George III is hiding?”
</p><br><p>Hvin Rambis revealed a smile.
</p><br><p>“Every king is restrained by three major contracts and can only reach a limit of Sequence 5. But with our help, he bypassed the restrictions and has already reached a higher level. Once the tides of the times come, he’ll easily be able to ascend to the spot that should’ve belonged to him.”
</p><br><p>Three major contracts... What’s that? It’s understandable to limit a king to Sequence 5 due to the strong push to keep mysticism under wraps. It’s best for a king to be changed normally. The people will find it acceptable if they could live for 80-90 years old, but to still be active at 120-130 years will be the cause for conspiracy theories and panic... George III cooperated with the Psychology Alchemists and the Demoness Sect to live longer? Typically, this is a restriction on the king, not the other members of the Augustus family. They should have Grounded Angels among them, so there’s no reason for them to support George III... Many questions arose in his mind.
</p><br><p>“George III still isn’t a demigod, is he? Is he using some method to possess a higher level and perform the ‘acting’ ahead of time?” Arianna asked unhurriedly.
</p><br><p>To the Church of Evernight, this was a crucial problem. If George III was already a demigod, they could directly contact the Church of Storms and Steam to capture him because the King himself was enough evidence.
</p><br><p>Hvin Rambis’s soul nodded and said, “Yes.”
</p><br><p>“What is the exact method?” Arianna continued asking.
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "68523d7a4f9baf3f067b6572", id: "pf-15551-1"})</script></div><br><p>Hvin Rambis slowly shook his head and said, “I’m not sure. The person in charge of this matter is our president. I only remember him once mentioning that he wanted George III to have more talent.”
</p><br><p>More talent? Upon hearing such a description, Klein instantly thought of something in Roselle’s diary.
</p><br><p>In the eyes of the emperor, the so-called “talent” was to make one’s psyche and soul more like a high-level ancestor, as such be able to obtain the recognition of the corresponding Beyonder characteristics or the mental imprint within Sealed Artifacts, allowing them to easily consume the potion and wield the Sealed Artifacts without the immense negative effects.
</p><br><p>This wasn’t a perfect solution. It could even be said that there were great latent risks. This was because the mental imprint would revert and control the consumer or wielder’s soul, causing them to experience certain changes.
</p><br><p>If anyone were to rely on this method to advance to a demigod, there was an extremely high chance of becoming a monster formed of mental sutures!
</p><br><p>Was George III hypnotized? He actually accepted such a method? No, if he was hypnotized, the Augustus family’s angel or Sealed Artifacts would definitely discover the problem... Klein became even more puzzled as he waited for the ascetic leader floating in the sky to ask further.
</p><br><p>Arianna clearly knew what “more talent” meant. Without any change in expression, she asked, “Who is your President?” Hvin Rambis revealed a look of reminiscence.
</p><br><p>“He has many identities and names, but I can confirm that he is the president of our Psychology Alchemists as long as I see him.
</p><br><p>“His current identities and names are:
</p><br><p>“One of the Four Kings of the Sea, the King of the Black Throne Barros Hopkins; the former chancellor of the Backlund Medical School; the royal family’s medical consultant; the already ‘dead’ Pauli Derlau; the famous ascetic of the Central Sonia Sea, Eric Drake...”
</p><br><p>King of the Black Throne... It was only then that he realized that he had heard of this title, but he had always neglected it, not taking it to heart and seldom thinking about it.
</p><br><p>So this Pirate King is from the Spectator pathway... He nodded in enlightenment.
</p><br><p>Arianna listened quietly and asked, “What secret is George III hiding in the Blood Emperor ruins?”
</p><br><p>Hvin Rambis’s slightly dazed expression changed slightly.
</p><br><p>“An extremely important thing. If he wants to grasp it, he will need a large number of sacrificial rituals.”
</p><br><p>“What is it?” Arianna pressed without any pause.
</p><br><p>Hvin Rambis was taken aback.
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "685267864f9baf3f067b8f34", id: "pf-15559-1"})</script></div><br><p>“I... I don’t remember...”
</p><br><p>He suddenly raised his hand to grip his soul’s head, clearly in pain.
</p><br><p>However, no matter how he thought about it, he couldn’t remember the answer.
</p><br><p>Was this memory forcefully “deleted” by Adam or a certain angel from the Spectator pathway? Klein watched with a heavy expression as he felt that the secret in the ruins was more important than he imagined.
</p><br><p>Arianna fell silent for a few seconds before lowering her head and asking Klein, “Do you have anything you want to ask?”
</p><br><p>Klein thought for a moment and asked Hvin Rambis, “What is the name of the High-Sequence Beyonder potions of the Spectator pathway?”
</p><br><p>The pain in Hvin Rambis’s soul lessened as he slowly replied, “Sequence 4 Manipulator. Sequence 3 Dreamweaver. Sequence 2 Discerner. Sequence 1 Author.”
</p><br><p>He didn’t mention Sequence 0 Visionary, clearly unaware.
</p><br><p>“What’s the potion formula for Manipulator?” Although Klein felt that his question was rather substandard compared to Ma’am Arianna’s, he still asked.
</p><br><p>In a dazed tone, Hvin Rambis said without hesitation, “The main ingredient is an elderly mind dragon’s complete brain, or the crystalline heart of a Tree Mentor, or a Beyonder characteristic of a Manipulator.
</p><br><p>The supplementary ingredients are 80 ml of the blood of an elderly mind dragon, 3 golden leaves of a Tree Mentor, and 7 different drops of tears from different humans or non-human creatures that were shed due to intense emotions...
</p><br><p>“The ritual is that on a special occasion with at least ten thousand people, drink the potion when they are in the midst of an emotional resonance.”
</p><br><p>In contrast, the difficulty of a demigod ritual of the Spectator pathway isn’t that high... That’s right. Spectators can heal and analyze themselves, allowing them to effectively deal with the madness and the loss of control brought about by the potion, so the ritual can be simplified... Klein nodded in thought.
</p><br><p>“What’s the potion formula for Dreamweaver?”
</p><br><p>“I don’t know.” Hvin Rambis shook his head.
</p><br><p>Alright then... Klein asked Hvin Rambis why he had personally come to Audrey and received the corresponding answer.
</p><br><p>Then, he said to Arianna, “I have no further questions.”
</p><br><p>The questions he had couldn’t be answered by Hvin Rambis.
</p><br><p>Arianna’s right hand pressed softly, causing Hvin Rambis’s soul to return to his body.
</p><br><p>Following that, the angel glanced at Klein and said calmly, “Don’t use him as a marionette.
</p><br><p>“Before his mental imprint is removed, it’s best you don’t use his Beyonder characteristic to create items.’ Of course, I don’t want Adam to visit me... Klein nodded sincerely.
</p><br><p>“I will remember it. Thank you, Ma’am Arianna.”</p>
