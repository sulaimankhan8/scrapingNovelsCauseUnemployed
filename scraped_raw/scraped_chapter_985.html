</p><br><p>Just as Leonard Mitchell’s figure appeared to the side of the long bronze table, he subconsciously stood up and wanted to bow to Mr. Fool.
</p><br><p>However, when he looked over, he found the seat empty. No one was sitting there.
</p><br><p>Doesn’t Mr. Fool usually sit there? A thought flashed through Leonard’s mind as he cast his gaze to the other end of the long mottled table.
</p><br><p>The World was sitting there silently as though he was fused with the gray fog in an indistinct blur.
</p><br><p>“... There’s only the two of us. There’s no need to deliberately use Gehrman Sparrow’s appearance,” Leonard casually said to The World as he sat back down.
</p><br><p>After discovering Mr. Fool’s absence, he instantly became relaxed. He wasn’t as reserved as he was in the previous Tarot Gathering—just short of throwing his leg up on the table.
</p><br><p>“It’s a habit,” Klein replied succinctly.
</p><br><p>Leonard nodded in thought.
</p><br><p>“I heard that Gehrman Sparrow’s persona at sea is a cold, reserved, refined, and polite person. Your current performance matches that description very well. However, you wasn’t like this in the past, Klein. You have to remember that you’re only acting. Do not be affected by your persona as Gehrman Sparrow.”
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "68523d6f4f9baf3f067b654a", id: "pf-15550-1"})</script></div><br><p>Hey, I pulled you up here to discuss Amon, not to have a chat! Why do you show so little concern towards your grandpa’s matters? Klein had indeed made it a habit to use The World’s persona in such situations. But when this was pointed out by Leonard, he was a little embarrassed to change back into his original appearance. He tersely acknowledged that he would keep it in mind.
</p><br><p>“Did Pallez Zoroast teach you about the part that ‘you’re only acting?”
</p><br><p>“Yes,” Leonard answered frankly.
</p><br><p>This grandpa seems pretty good. He mentioned such crucial information to Leonard... Compared to “Him,” the rat demigod from before was really up to no good. She didn’t teach Hazel any of the most common knowledge. Even if she did, she distorted some of it. Heh heh, no matter how unaffiliated you are, how could they not know anything at the level of a demigod? Even that half-crazy sea serpent, Kalvetua, knew how to respond to rituals or obtain sacrificial items. It even knew some theurgy and how to perform bestowments... Klein established a first impression of Pallez Zoroast.
</p><br><p>However, he wasn’t hasty to make a judgment. After all, fishing was an activity that required bait. Just one instance didn’t prove much. Seeing Klein being silent, Leonard cut the small talk and got down to business.
</p><br><p>“Where did you discover traces of Blasphemer Amon?”
</p><br><p>Klein went straight to the point.
</p><br><p>“I was pursuing a demigod of the Marauder pathway who was on the brink of losing control. However, I ended up encountering Amon in the outskirts of Backlund. All I could do was use Mr. Fool’s powers to directly escape.”
</p><br><p>“Amon’s avatar really is still in Backlund...” Leonard sighed before he asked in a rather curious and desultory manner, “Why were you pursuing a Marauder pathway demigod who’s on the brink of losing control?”
</p><br><p>After he asked the question, he realized something and swiftly added, “If it involves some plans of Mr. Fool, pretend as though I never asked.”
</p><br><p>Why? Isn’t dealing with Beyonders on the brink of losing control or those who have lost control the duty of a Nighthawk? Klein sighed when he heard Leonard’s question.
</p><br><p>It stirred up memories of his time in Tingen City.
</p><br><p>In that short two plus months, he had handled many similar matters. It included the Mandated Punisher of the Church of Storms who turned into a monster, Hood Eugen’s loss of control, and Old Neil’s corruption by the Hidden Sage. Although they were only a handful, they left a deep impression on him. It drilled certain actions deep to the bone.
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "68523d7a4f9baf3f067b6572", id: "pf-15551-1"})</script></div><br><p>Therefore, after taking into account everything that he knew, and coming to the conclusion that the Marauder pathway demigod was on the brink of losing control after rabidly biting someone, he didn’t hesitate and used his illusion from downstairs. From that, he gained confirmation from Hazel and didn’t even wait a day or two to make preparations. All he did was do a divination above the gray fog and came up with a rough plan before taking action.
</p><br><p>Such matters were emergencies for him!
</p><br><p>In addition, Klein had long had the intention of getting rid of the Marauder pathway demigod because the malintent she had shown when dealing with Hazel was obvious. Furthermore, she had tried to entice Miss Magician to seek out treasure that was in actual fact a trap. If he wasn’t a demigod back then, which meant a great difference in strength, he would’ve taken action back then. Besides, he was also afraid that he would trigger unnecessary accidents.
</p><br><p>It was precisely because of this that he followed his predetermined plan to eliminate her once he confirmed the Marauder pathway demigod’s condition.
</p><br><p>The first stage of his plan was to lure the enemy out of Moose Manor to prevent her from producing her incomplete Mythical Creature form before dying, as that would’ve affected the ordinary people. The result was pretty satisfactory. With himself as the bait, he achieved his goal, but he failed to use the Air Cannon bombardment to finish the battle. This made the Marauder pathway demigod flee into the woods and parasitize a tree.
</p><br><p>Klein actually had a second stage to his plan and had even prepared contingencies in the event he failed to eliminate her. To his surprise, Amon suddenly appeared, making him terminate all his plans and flee without any hesitation. Klein’s contingency was to let a marionette escape the battlefield and write to the experimental demigod byproduct of the Numinous Episcopate, Patrick Bryan, to get his help. This Undying likely possessed the ability to traverse the spirit world after all. And if there were any additional unforeseen circumstances, he could summon Miss Messenger and make payment after the deed.
</p><br><p>As his memories surfaced, Klein replied to Leonard with a sighing tone, “A secret.”
</p><br><p>After pausing for a second, he asked, “Why didn’t you find an opportunity to inform the Church of Evernight about the arrival of Amon’s avatar in Backlund?”
</p><br><p>Leonard hurriedly gave an explanation, indicating that if Amon’s actual body were to arrive, a deity’s descent was almost certain. He also explained that Amon could use the death of “His” avatar to see the corresponding changes in destiny; thus, finding the source of the stir and figuring out the activity range of the mastermind. It was also Amon’s style to circle about a superficial avatar but hide a dozen, dozens, or hundreds of avatars. Amon’s avatars could parasitize all kinds of creatures with spirituality. If one wasn’t a demigod, they wouldn’t even notice the parasite.
</p><br><p>Towards the end, Leonard informed Klein in detail about the example Old Man had raised of how Amon would steal one’s destiny.
</p><br><p>This sent a chill running down Klein’s back, thankful that he hadn’t been rash in dealing with Amon. Otherwise, Mr. Fool might’ve been replaced.
</p><br><p>It’s no wonder Leonard didn’t report the matter... For Amon to appear so openly, “He” is actually fishing. Furthermore, he has even more avatars hiding in secret, and “He” can parasitize the microbes in the air... This alone sends my scalp tingling. The creatures I can control at the moment can’t even reach that state. The smaller the creature, the harder it is to see the Spirit Body Threads. It’s quite a special case... Sigh, I can’t use the Church’s power, unless it’s done by someone who is without any problems in every aspect... Klein commiserated as he gained a deeper understanding of Amon’s terror. It left him a deeper impression.
</p><br><p>From his point of view, Leonard was an excellent candidate to report the matter to the Church of Evernight, but with Pallez Zoroast parasitizing him, he didn’t dare expose his existence to Amon.
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "685267864f9baf3f067b8f34", id: "pf-15559-1"})</script></div><br><p>In addition, The Hanged Man could also shoulder this responsibility, but he was unable to provide the source of the news. This meant problems that deserved deeper investigations into.
</p><br><p>One choice after another flashed across Klein’s mind. Finally, he paused on himself-his identities as Klein Moretti and Gehrman Sparrow!
</p><br><p>As a Blessed of Evernight, it’s entirely reasonable for me to inform the Church about Amon’s appearance in Backlund. Amon won’t be able to pick faults with that.
</p><br><p>And having involved myself with the battle with the Marauder pathway demigod tonight, as the Bizarro Sorcerer who witnessed Amon and is now in possession of the knowledge that the Angel of Time’s avatar is here in Backlund, it’s also very normal and not something that will garner Amon’s suspicion. At the same time, as I’m a Blessed of Evernight, just the loss of an avatar likely won’t incur “His” full wrath for revenge. After all, “He” might be facing a very possible trap-a deity’s descent! Having a backer really feels good... However, a price is always exacted for what fate bestows... Klein quickly came to a conclusion over the matter.
</p><br><p>Then, he habitually changed his point of view and began considering this matter from Amon’s point of view.
</p><br><p>Amon is definitely no stranger to Bizarro Sorcerers. “He” can determine my pathway from my control of the marionettes and my swapping of locations.
</p><br><p>Since Amon allowed a Bizarro Sorcerer to flee, “He” must’ve made preparations to be exposed. “He” might even be hoping to attract the target “He” is looking for.
</p><br><p>I was using Gehrman Sparrow’s face, but that doesn’t imply anything. A Faceless’s appearance is the least of one’s concern... Hmm, then how would Amon determine my identity? A powerhouse that lurks in the dark and a demigod of the Seer pathway... As the Church of Evernight and the Secret Order are in control of the formulas, ingredients, and a mermaid, there are almost no unaffiliated Bizarro Sorcerers. The descendants of the Antigonus family have all been wiped out. Therefore, a Bizarro Sorcerer is either from the Secret Order or a secret proxy that the Church of Evernight secretly nurtures...
</p><br><p>Together with me being in Backlund, the answer is almost obvious...
</p><br><p>Due to these reasons, Amon wouldn’t find it difficult to determine that the Church of Evernight is aware of “His” whereabouts and will begin an operation to wipe “Him” out. My reporting of “Him” will be within expectations. Not doing so would be abnormal...
</p><br><p>Yes, “He” will definitely be hiding. Even if “He” replaces the identity of that Marauder pathway demigod, “He” wouldn’t come to Böklund Street anytime soon!
</p><br><p>Having made this judgment, Klein immediately felt a little more relieved because it meant that he would have plenty of time to prepare!
</p><br><p>“What ideas do you have?” Seeing Klein’s prolonged silence after he finished his description, Leonard couldn’t help but ask.
</p><br><p>Klein reined in his thoughts and asked without answering him, “What suggestions does Pallez Zoroast have regarding this?”
</p><br><p>“He’ said that if you wish to deal with Amon’s avatar in Backlund, you have to first obtain the blessings of Concealment,” Leonard replied truthfully.
</p><br><p>Blessings of Concealment... Pallez Zoroast is openly trying to test me. Half the symbol behind The Fool’s seat represents concealment... Using Paper Angels and the Red Priest card, I can stir the powers of the mysterious space above the gray fog, making it possible for me to disrupt Amon’s avatar. However, it’s probably unable to prevent “Him” from prying into fate itself... However, I still have another identity as Evernight’s Blessed, and another title of the Goddess is the Mother of Concealment... Is eliminating Amon’s avatar considered paying the price or receiving a bestowment? Seems like both... Klein thought before replying in a deep voice:
</p><br><p>“Tell Pallez Zoroast that I’m a Blessed of Concealment. I will attempt to pray for help.”
</p><br><p>He was referring to being the Blessed of the Mother of Concealment, but it was certain that Pallez Zoroast would understand it as being The Fool’s Blessed.</p>
