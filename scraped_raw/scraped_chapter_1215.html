</p><br><p>When he heard the voices deep in the grayish-white mist, Klein trembled slightly as the back of his head turned numb.
</p><br><p>This feeling quickly spread to every part of his body, causing tiny goosebumps to protrude on his skin.
</p><br><p>This was the second time he had heard the name “The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings” in the real world. And the first time, it was said by Amon after “He” stole his thoughts. In fact, Amon didn’t know the exact meaning behind it, nor did “He” truly grasp the incantation.
</p><br><p>Therefore, in essence, this was the first time.
</p><br><p>At the borders of the legendary Western Continent, outside his hometown that had vanished, this was the first time that he heard the incantation that caused him to transmigrate into the real world. He heard one of the most important secrets hidden at the bottom of his heart and heard the oriental honorific name that was pointed at an unknown existence.
</p><br><p>He stood there, his mind almost blank. His ears echoed with occasional sounds of chanting and shouting.
</p><br><p>“The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings...
</p><br><p>“The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings...
</p><br><p>“The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings...”
</p><br><p>When the voices became softer and softer until they almost disappeared, Klein finally recovered his train of thought.
</p><br><p>As a fake god that had done a lot of “guilty matters,” his first reaction was:
</p><br><p>By changing ‘The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings’ to the ‘King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck,’ will I suffer divine punishment?
</p><br><p>Back when he had set up the three-stanza honorific name of The Fool, the first stanza described his experience and state. Back then, he had thought that it was a transmigration, and he was afraid of exposing the problem. He had changed “The Fool from an alternate world” to “The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era”, but in the end, it pointed to his true nature. The second stanza was to bind the gray fog to him, making the direction clearer.
</p><div id="pf-15550-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="3"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "68523d6f4f9baf3f067b654a", id: "pf-15550-1"})</script></div><br><p>And in order to completely limit and not cause any ambiguity, Klein directly translated the last line of the incantation which was, “The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings.”
</p><br><p>He originally thought that it was nothing, but later on, he suspected that his “transmigration” was a result of the former owner of the strange door of light in Sefirah Castle—The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings. Or rather, it was a certain existence hiding “Their” true identity. Of course, it was also possible that the “The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings” was the actual incarnation before creating another identity that suited the present world. As for what the identity was, Klein wasn’t sure.
</p><br><p>This was because he had never heard the honorific name of The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings elsewhere in the real world. Therefore, although there was suspicion and fear present, he didn’t actually pay too much attention to it. It seemed like he was already used to it.
</p><br><p>However, at that moment, the words “The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings” were like salvos that kept blasting at his heart, bombarding his mind, causing all the concerns and fear that he had accumulated in his subconscious to surge out.
</p><br><p>After regaining his composure, he began to force himself to use his rationality to think about his current situation:
</p><br><p>Is this chanting hidden in the grayish-white fog, or is it from the vanished Western Continent?
</p><br><p>I already thought that this fog’s color and state is very close to the one below Sefirah Castle... Its power comes from “history”? One has to have the correct powers over “time” to open it?
</p><br><p>Queen of Calamity Cohinem once said that the Western Continent would definitely reappear at the dawn of the apocalypse... In other words, only by pushing “time” towards that temporal node would the grayish-white fog come alive. Only then would it be possible to use the corresponding incantation to open it?
</p><br><p>The person who made the Western Continent vanish, seal it, or create a protective quarantine... is The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings, the existence suspected to be the previous owner of Sefirah Castle?
</p><br><p>According to all the clues, Sefirah Castle and the rest were left behind by the original Creator. They were created by the various parts of “His” body, or something that “He” personally created... The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings is equivalent to the former owner of Sefirah Castle, and also equivalent to the original Creator? However, Sefirah Castle existed only after the original Creator split. Furthermore, the chants of The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings only point to Sefirah Castle and don’t affect places like the Chaos Sea...
</p><br><p>Also, the disappearance of the Western Continent is definitely something from before the Second Epoch. As an ancient god, even Elf King Soniathrym was unable to return to “His” hometown...
</p><br><p>In other words, in the chaotic and crazy First Epoch or even before then, the original Creator—the Oldest One—had split into objects like Chaos Sea and Sefirah Castle. More things happened before the ancient gods were born? These matters caused the Western Continent to vanish, and the former owner of Sefirah Castle to disappear?
</p><br><p>The prophecy of the ancient sun god—the City of Silver’s Creator—is also very interesting. It says that someone will walk out of this grayish-white fog, so “He” sent people to stay in Moon City and guard this place. Strictly speaking, I actually come from the Western continent or this grayish-white fog. However, I left the Western Continent to enter Sefirah Castle in a time long before the ancient sun god’s prediction. The year I left the grayish-white fog was 1349 and found myself in Loen...
</p><br><p>Yes, after going around in circles, I came here again and met with the people from Moon City... The ancient sun god’s prophecy really has come true. It’s just that the process is a little twisted and complicated, but the way it was achieved is rather unexpected...
</p><br><p>As he pondered, his mood gradually improved. This was because the situation at the scene and his spiritual intuition had told him that there were still civilizations in the Western Continent that were isolated by the grayish-white fog. Many people were still alive.
</p><br><p>This method of making the Western Continent vanish reminds me of the ritual for Miracle Invoker, as well as using the power of space-time. They are mainly from the Apprentice and Marauder pathways... So, the previous owner of Sefirah Castle, The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings, corresponds to these three neighboring pathways? Klein reined in his thoughts as he took two steps forward.
</p><br><p>He then turned around and said to Nim and the rest, “I heard the voice clearly.”
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "68523d7a4f9baf3f067b6572", id: "pf-15551-1"})</script></div><br><p>“...What are they saying?” Nim’s grayish-white eyes suddenly widened, his deeply pockmarked face filled with excitement.
</p><br><p>A’dal, Xin, Rus, and company had similar reactions, ones that were even more intense.
</p><br><p>Even their bodies began to tremble.
</p><br><p>This was a problem that had troubled the residents of Moon City for more than a thousand years. Resolving this problem was a symbol of escaping their current predicament!
</p><br><p>Klein took a deep breath and said in the tone of a charlatan, “They are praying to my Lord.”
</p><br><p>This was definitely not a lie. After all, as The Fool, he had already gained initial mastery of Sefirah Castle. The last sentence of his honorific name was the “King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck,” which was equivalent to “The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings.”
</p><br><p>Nim and company fell silent. When they looked back at Klein, their eyes were filled with obvious respect and fear.
</p><br><p>Together with the “miracles” Klein had displayed, they gradually viewed Mr. Fool as their savior.
</p><br><p>Klein surveyed the area and said, “Retreat at least a hundred meters.”
</p><br><p>“Alright, Your Excellency.” The High Priest, Nim, agreed without hesitation.
</p><br><p>After the Moon City’s Beyonders had retreated to a sufficient distance, Klein reached into the void with his right hand and quickly dragged out another projection of himself as his actual body disappeared.
</p><br><p>Right on the heels of that, the Historical Void projection of Klein walked to the front of the solidified grayish-white fog. He extended his right hand and pressed it down.
</p><br><p>It was as if there was an invisible barrier that was slightly cold, blocking everything.
</p><br><p>After staring at it for two seconds, Klein opened his mouth, suppressed his voice, and recited in Chinese, “The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings.”
</p><br><p>As his voice echoed out, the grayish-white fog in front of him didn’t react at all. It remained still and frozen.
</p><br><p>He waited for nearly a minute. After some thought, he took a deep breath and muttered again:
</p><br><p>“The Immortal Lord of Heaven and Earth for Blessings;
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "685267864f9baf3f067b8f34", id: "pf-15559-1"})</script></div><br><p>“The Sky Lord of Heaven and Earth for Blessings;
</p><br><p>“The Exalted Thearch of Heaven and Earth for Blessings;
</p><br><p>“The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings.”
</p><br><p>This was the complete incantation of the luck enhancement ritual.
</p><br><p>As the last word was said, Klein’s right hand that was pressing on the invisible barrier suddenly felt an obvious tremble.
</p><br><p>The gray fog began to shake as though a boulder had been thrown into a lake.
</p><br><p>The ripples quickly spread, overlapping each other as they formed a “door” in front of him.
</p><br><p>A bolt of lightning streaked across the sky, illuminating the scene. Not far away, the pupils of the Moon City Beyonders widened as they were unable to shift their eyes away.
</p><br><p>Amongst them, the ones who arrived later felt their hearts waver after witnessing such a scene. They found it impossible to contain themselves.
</p><br><p>To them, this was undoubtedly a miracle!
</p><br><p>Klein held his breath as he waited for the door to take shape. However, the ripples finally calmed down. They were only a step away from success.
</p><br><p>“...” After a moment of silence, Klein repeated the incantations again. However, even if the ripples in the grayish-white fog didn’t disappear, they were unable to truly outline the door.
</p><br><p>For a moment, he wanted to attempt with the complete ritual procedure. In other words, he would place four portions of food and recite the incantations while taking four steps counterclockwise. But very quickly, he was amused by his idea.
</p><br><p>Because by doing this, he would enter Sefirah Castle without opening the invisible barrier here.
</p><br><p>After exhaling, Klein took out a gold coin from the void and used divination to confirm that the effects of the complete ritual would be as he imagined.
</p><br><p>It really isn’t time yet because the apocalypse hasn’t dawned on us? Klein looked at the grayish-white fog in front of him for a few minutes without any movement.
</p><br><p>When a bolt of lightning tore through the sky and illuminated his face, he turned around and walked in front of the Moon City High Priest, Nim, with the lantern in hand. He said calmly, “It hasn’t reached the correct point in time to open it, as spoken in the revelation. There’s more than a decade of waiting left.”
</p><br><p>Without waiting for any response from the likes of Nim, A’dal, and the rest, Klein pointed to the nearby darkness with his empty right hand.
</p><br><p>“I will be meditating here for some time. If you want to experience the radiance of the Lord and listen to ‘His’ teachings, you can come here anytime whenever the lightning frequency is high.
</p><br><p>“I’ll do a single purification and treatment session every day, at a time when the lightning is most frequent.”
</p><br><p>He didn’t attempt to get the residents of Moon City to convert their faiths, nor did he plan on heading directly to the city or ask about any specific information. He wanted to give them some time to take things in.
</p><br><p>Nim secretly heaved a sigh of relief and replied with increasingly great respect, “I will pass on your words to everyone.”</p>
