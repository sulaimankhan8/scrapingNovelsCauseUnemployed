</p><br><p>This is the cultivation I’ve gone through as a fan of courtroom dramas and detective series, as well as me being a loyal reader of crime deduction novels.
</p><br><p>Of course, I don’t say it out loud. I believe that people with standard intelligence can come to a similar conclusion.
</p><br><p>When the guard on duty calls to confirm my identity, I take out my phone and check the time.
</p><br><p>There’s more than enough time... I let out a sigh of relief as I unhurriedly circle around the pond in the middle of the courtyard and enter the building facing the main entrance.
</p><br><p>After I run through the possible exchange in my mind, I knock on the door of the target’s office three minutes early.
</p><br><p>“Please come in.” A mellow voice sounds from inside.
</p><br><p>“O-Officer Deng...” As soon as I push open the door and enter, I realize that the officer sitting behind the desk is the one who had come to check on my residence permit!
</p><br><p>I always imagined that he’s a police officer at the police station, but I never expected him to have an office at the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He even has the room to himself!
</p><br><p>“You are?” Officer Deng raises his hand to comb his receding hairline and asks with a puzzled look, “Do we know each other?”
</p><br><p>“Last night, you checked on my residence permit and reminded me of a mysterious cult. Later, we met again in Lawson. I even reported a woman suspected to be a member of the cult.” I begin to suspect that the person in front of me is Officer Deng’s biological brother, but I still give the details.
</p><br><p>Officer Deng is enlightened.

</p><br><p>“I’m face-blind, and I don’t have a good memory. It was night, so I couldn’t see clearly.”
</p><br><p>I don’t need you to tell me that your memory isn’t good or how you have face-blindness. I can tell... I politely smile.
</p><br><p>“Today, I’m representing the Intis Group to take over the previous project.”
</p><br><p>“Yes, we agreed to meet at four.” Officer Deng points at the chair opposite his desk.
</p><br><p>I immediately approach it and plan on placing the black notebook that I just bought on the table. I will then flip it to the middle—I can’t let Officer Deng notice that I just bought it and have never written on it.
</p><br><p>Officer Deng glances at the notebook and frowns slightly.
</p><br><p>Following that, he picks up the phone and dials an internal department number.
</p><br><p>“Hey, the Intis Group is here. Come over for a meeting.”
</p><br><p>After a simple briefing, he puts down the phone and smiles at me.
</p><br><p>“This is an international collaboration project. We can’t decide on our own. Yes, the other party’s representative will be here soon.”
</p><br><p>“I’m aware of that.” I’ve read the relevant documents in the morning and know what’s going on.
</p><br><p>Of course, even if I’m lazy and didn’t read it, I’ll still have given such an answer. I can’t let the partner I’m working with find out that I’m skiving and not doing my job well.
</p><br><p>Not long after I sit down, I hear Officer Deng’s office door open.
</p><br><p>I stand up politely and look back. I see an old man in a long black robe.
</p><div id="pf-15551-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="4"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "68523d7a4f9baf3f067b6572", id: "pf-15551-1"})</script></div><br><p>His hair is white, and the wrinkles at the edge of his eyes and mouth are deeply recessed. His dark red eyes appear slightly turbid.
</p><br><p>A red moon pendant hangs on his chest. He looks like a priest from a cathedral.
</p><br><p>A foreign priest... I nod with a smile, fully displaying my courtesy.
</p><br><p>For some reason, I find this old man a little familiar, just like the first time I met Officer Deng.
</p><br><p>Strange... Recently, I’ve been feeling sad for some inexplicable reason. Is this the after-effect of the Assassin beverage? I silently inhale and control my emotions.
</p><br><p>At that moment, Officer Deng introduces, “Old Neil, an Interpol representative, a clergyman.”
</p><br><p>“Hello, Mr. Neil.” I quickly greet him.
</p><br><p>Old Neil doesn’t speak. He sizes me up and chuckles.
</p><br><p>“Lad, have you been troubled by ghosts recently?”
</p><br><p>...You can tell? I’m shocked. I don’t know if I should admit it or hide it from a stranger.
</p><br><p>“Don’t lie. My eyes are very sharp.” Old Neil smiles and points at his eyes.
</p><br><p>“A little...” I mutter.
</p><br><p>“Haha.” Old Neil immediately laughs. “You’re still too young. You confessed the moment I called you out. Actually, I’m not that sure. Yes, I’m a priest. I have the ability to expel wraiths and shadows. Do you need my help?”
</p><br><p>...Is it okay to discuss such feudal superstitions in front of a police officer? I open my mouth, speechless.
</p><br><p>Old Neil walks to Officer Deng’s table and very naturally picks up the coffee can on it.
</p><div id="pf-15559-1" data-format="display" data-lazy="false" data-index="5"><script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "685267864f9baf3f067b8f34", id: "pf-15559-1"})</script></div><br><p>“Don’t worry. I don’t charge much. If you’re still a believer of the Goddess, I can even do it for free.”
</p><br><p>I wasn’t a believer of the Goddess in the past, but I am now! At this moment, my heart is palpitating.
</p><br><p>I hesitate for two seconds before sighing.
</p><br><p>“But, I’ve already found a helper.”
</p><br><p>“Who is it? There aren’t many people with such abilities. Most of them are cheats.” Old Neil skillfully brews his coffee and asks casually.
</p><br><p>“...Daly, do you know her?” I ask hesitantly.
</p><br><p>“Daly... Ah, then that’s fine.” Old Neil retracts his smile and asks, “Are you the representative of the Intis Group? Let’s begin.”
</p><br><p>At the same time, Officer Deng shakes his head with a smile, looking helpless.
</p><br><p>“You know Madam Daly?” I ask.
</p><br><p>Old Neil sighs and points at Officer Deng.
</p><br><p>“His fiancée.”
</p><br><p>“Oh, oh...” Everyone knows each other! I can’t help but sigh.
</p><br><p>This boosts my confidence in Madam Daly.
</p><br><p>I stop chatting and begin communicating with Officer Deng and Old Neil about the project, taking note of their requests.
</p><br><p>An hour passes.
</p><br><p>“Yawn.” Old Neil stretches his back. “It’s finally over. These old bones of mine really can’t withstand the torment of such meetings. I no longer have the energy.”
</p><br><p>With that said, he stands up and smiles at me and Officer Deng.
</p><br><p>“It’s time for me to retire.
</p><br><p>“It’s time for me to leave. I’ll go to a faraway village. I’ll grow some flowers, feed the chickens, and play the piano for my wife. I don’t have to worry about things here anymore.”
</p><br><p>Officer Deng stands up as well. As he sends Old Neil out, he smiles and says, “Let’s go together.”
</p><br><p>As I watch them leave, I suddenly feel speechless.</p>
